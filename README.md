# dark_web_authorship

EECE5644 final project documentation. Applies LSTM and RNN neural networks to authorship classification in dark web marketplaces using Twitter GloVe vector representaions. 

The GloVe files were far too massive to add to the repository; however, can be found at Stanford's GloVe site: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Credit goes to Gwern Branwen for the dataset, which may be accessed at https://www.gwern.net/DNM-archives
