    Hey Recently I've heard from a vendor and serval other sources that you shouldnt track your packages inside tor.
    <br/>
    The reason being that the website will flag the order for being tracked inside tor.
    <br/>
    Is this true? if it is true is it safe to track a package through regular means? Or would that record your ip address?

    Tracking parcels especially EMS parcels with TOR will likely flag it.  If a parcel gets intercepted and you were tracking it through regular means you would have at least that boning fact against you.  Best not to track it at all until you think it won't show.

    Are you asking about tracking or delivery confirmation (DCN)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most vendors don't including tracking numbers because it doesn't really make sense. There's not really any smart way to check them without going through some serious processes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DCN should never be checked on anything illegal unless there is a serious dispute going on. TOR could raise flags on the package and checking it through the clearnet is a very stupid move for obvious reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be patient and stay in touch with your vendor. Is your package missing?

    Somebody recently brought up checking the tracking through one of the thousands of online tracking sites that aren't affiliated with the postal company the vendor has used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Taking Canada Post, as an example, a quick Google search for "Canada Post tracking" throws up over 60,000,000 results - the fifth and sixth of which are trackingnumber.org and packagetrackr.com
    <br/>
    I reckon you could check them through Tor safely enough as I believe the site simply relays the tracking number to Canada Post's system, then returns the result to you without you actually checking the Canada Post tracking system itself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (Do your own research on this though, as I stand to be corrected on this!)

    what he said +Tor+Proxy should be good. but ive never had any trouble from tracking through Tor to the SR's most notorious country. better that then tracking with your real IP. byebye plausible denialbility
