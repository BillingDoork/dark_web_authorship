    hi, i have never ordered anything overseas on silk road and i am thinking that i am going to order a few grams of hash to me from the Netherlands, i am in canada and am just wondering what the probability of it making it here would be.

    Thanks for any help in advanced!

    The Netherlands usually is flagged but I have never had a problem ordering from there.  I would go for it as long as the vendor has a good reputations.  Check the forums.

    Canada does not flag the netherlands anymore then we do the rest of the commonwealth.  Remember it wasn't too long ago we were a british colony.

    It comes down to shipper anyways, if you buy off a vendor who has superb packaging it makes no difference if it's from zimbabwe.

    The idea that any shipment from the netherlands would be suspect is much overrated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While it is certainly true that the netherlands is a big player in shipments of drugs around the world, this does not really apply to small personal orders. Ordering something that fits the mailbox from holland probably isn't much more suspect then ordering from any other european country.

    The odds of 10 grams of hash being detected is very slim.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors are very aware of not leaving any trace of cannabis on the package so the sniffer dog will go for something else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try a gram or two as a test run. Check the vendor for his or her success rates with international shipping. Many are excellent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck!  :)

    go with whatever you feel comfortable with, even if you manage to get something from overseas its not worth it if you're a nervous wreck while waiting for your package. I personally try to stick with domestic, but I have ordered from overseas (sometimes the deal is just too good haha) and I have never had any problems. Don't get cocky though, stay safe and spread the love  8)

    Personally i wouldn't do it, but I live in the US and the decision is based on what I've read about NL orders having an overall low success rate here.  You have to think of what you're losing and whether or not that hash from the NL vs. hash you could get from Canada or US is worth the risk.  You wont just be losing your coins and the product.  The two important things you'll lose are peace of mind and confidence in your address not being flagged.  I've had every order come through successfully to date, and thankfully so.  I would rather get straight up ripped off/scammed on a large order than ever have it confiscated and get a love letter.  Then i would be looking over my shoulder all the time and nobody likes thyt feeling (except for MisterDank).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know the NL has some great products that I wish I could order with confidence, but a few of the vendors I've looked at for PED's and H wont even ship to the US, again, Canada is an entirely different creature, and i have no idea if it would be safer or come with less risk than it does for us in the US, but Im guessing once your address is flagged, so are you, and that moving wouldn't necessarily remove a flag.  It also comes down to whether or not you vend as well.  best of luck whatever your choice.

    Well, i suppose there is a fair amount of fear towards dealing with the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally i  wouldn't want to ship illicit drugs to the US either, just in case they are intercepted and my identity as a vendor would be revealed somehow. Perhaps its paranoid, but i wouldn't put it beyond US policy to issue an international arrest warrant for someone that attempted to send $1000 worth of drugs into the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For me that would probably complicate travel very much, and everyone outside the US knows that extradition to the US is a one way ticket to a place where noone will ever hear from you again.

    I think it goes both ways....US customs would likely be more suspect of a package coming from the Netherlands than it would a package coming from the UK or Germany.
    <br/>
    The fear on the Netherlands end you speak of is equally legitimate.  The US is definitely  infamous for extraditing people abroad for drug charges and otherwise...I don't know about a one way ticket to a Guantanamo type facility, maybe, but I think if you have the money and a proper lawyer on retainer that you would at least not "disappear" .  Just guessing though....

    There is no doubt that the Netherlands is a universally,  well known hot spot for exporting drugs to countries all over the world. However, I have to agree with some of the others who have posted on this thread in regards to there being a lot of speculation, assumptions and innuendo which continues to cloud the issue of some packages not arriving from the Netherlands. There may be an increased level of security shown to packages from the Netherlands which would no doubt make it more difficult to get things through Customs, however, in scenarios such as this, the vendors really need to "up the anti" and refine their shipping methods and even approach things from a  totally different perspective. Look at purchasing some newer or even superior quality packaging materials in the hope of improving the professionalism of their packaging and not attracting the attention of Customs. For me, the time and effort a vendor spends on packaging your purchase safely and securely, being careful not to leave any trace of an illegal substance on the package itself (and the contents vac.sealed and secured in stealth) , which  minimizes any unwanted attention a drug dog may show, and the professionalism shown by vendors in producing "business"style letters with all the labeling professionally printed on and not hand written , which helps it blend in beautifully with the everyday mail, are the major contributors in your package making it from the Netherlands to the country it is destined for. From my experience on SR, all my orders dispatched from the Netherlands have arrived to Oz quickly and safely, as the quality of the packaging was just superb. :) :)

    It really does seem to depend on how the packaging is done. So many nice weed offers come from NL .. kind of hard to pass around them all the time. With triple vacuum sealing and a prof. envelope it should be fine though. I will probably give it a test run with a small amt. soon... just remembered I sent myself 5g once not once vacuum sealed and only put in a small plastic box. .. arrived without any problems within the EU.... what i am personally more afraid of is a 20-30g order from overseas to EU. Dunno .. just dont have much trust in a looong way delivery..
