    So a friend of mine got a letter from the German customs saying he would have to show up to pick up an international package. It was a small bubble envelope containing less than 10 grams of weed. Would it be a good idea for him to just go and pick it up? it was not a very large amount and I think if customs actually found it they would just send a love letter.
    <br/>
    Any info regarding what to do in this situation would be helpful.

    I'd contact them and not acknowledge ownership.

    It's probably best to say nothing at all or get a lawyer.

    No its not a good idea. Sounds like one of those sting operations the police do sometimes where they send letters to people who have warrants notifying them that they won a free dvd player or a trip to the bahamas. They when they show up theres a room full of cops waiting to arrest them.

    Its 10 grams of weed, forget about it and move on.

    From the research I have done it looks like they would not have such operations for such a small amount and even if they hadÂ  a reason to arrest the person they would be able to do it at their house would they not?

    I honestly dont know anything about german customs, but the situation sounds sketchy to me and my spider sense is tingling so i would avoid the situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thats just me though.... good luck to your friend on whatever path he decides.

    Just ask a professional: http://www.gruene-hilfe.de/

    I don't think they charge anything for a simple question.
