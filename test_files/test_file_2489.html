    A couple weeks ago I placed a small order with a relatively new domestic benzo vendor. Today I messaged the vendor expressing concern that my package had not arrived. He/she was more than willing to refund and told me that recently they had a few package that didn't make it to their destination and were all "dropped in the same location".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is my first run-in with this kind of situation, should I be concerned about that address being flagged? Is this a common occurrence?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    They probably fucked up with the postage. Some retarded new vendors seem to be having this problem a lot lately. Im not sure whats gonna happen, tbh.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was postage related the packages will get returned to whatever return address the seller used. This could be a problem if the person whos address was used opens the packages and goes to the police when they find drugs. If the return address if completely made up i think the packages will remain in the post office until they claimed, or destroyed.

    *New vendors- Weigh your packages and make sure you put enough postage on them. If you dont you could be potentially ruining someones life. Thank you.
