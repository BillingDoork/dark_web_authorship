    I have shipped MJ a few times before several years ago with the jar of PB and many vacuum sealed bags method through that very popular purple courier, but after frequenting these forums and making various purchases on SR (none of which were MJ by the way) I started to wonder if my old method really was a sound way of doing things or if I just got lucky those few times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is USPS the way to go for something like this? What are some better packaging approaches that I can take besides the overused and potentially risky jar of PB method? I am not asking people to outright spell out packaging tactics as that is obviously too much info to be divulging on the SR forums but if anyone has any pointers or tips, or couriers they would recommend or stay away from, it would help a lot.
    <br/>

    I am just trying to ship a half to a oz just so me and some friends can smoke good stuff on our vacation and not have to buy the expensive crappy local swag. Thanks for any info you guys can provide.
