    Does anybody in the UK vendors and buyers alike have any experience of packages being seized ?
    <br/>
    How would you know if customs has a packet and any idea what they do when they find one ? same question goes for packets found by the royal mail although in there case i would imagine it gets smoked.....
    <br/>
    today i received an empty cd box the jiffy bag had been taped down with sellotape and the box inside was slightly damaged ,would customs just remove the product and send the package on ? i would have expected to at least of popped a covering note in saying `nice try but fuck you ` ?
    <br/>
    im still awaiting reply from vendor on whether he tapes down the envelopes he sends out but the experiences of others interests me greatly !

    My experience is with mainly international mail.
    <br/>
    You just get nothing, no seizure notice or anything. If its a small amount I guess it either gets stolen and smoked or destroyed. Nothing has ever come of it for me. I've heard sometimes with tracked mail you get a letter or something, but it seems they don't do much unless its a very large quantity.
    <br/>
    I can count on 1 hand the amount of normal UK domestic mail that's ever gone missing in my lifetime. 1 was a SR order 1/8th of weed and it never arrived, if the vendor actually sent it which I cant confirm either way.

    yeah the pack in question was just a small amount of opium coming from europe but i also have a domestic 4g of hash outstanding it usually arrives within 24hrs but may have been held up by the olympics but that was 8 days ago :/ starting to wonder if ive been flagged as i lost a package i posted to myself from Dam around 2 months back ,it wasnt alot just a nice selection but that was the first in  20 times i posted to myself and now with the outstanding domestic n empty box im starting to worry

    i got 1g of Opium from EU sent to UK 2 weeks ago no problems. i think that perhaps your envelope was damaged and some smart ass has had a look inside and either confiscated your opium or stolen it. sorry.

    if your postie smoked your opium then hes got your hash aswell and will get anything else you order
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ive never had any probs and 90% are from NL  and uk while olympics is on has been as fast as ever next day every time and 2 days from NL
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the biggest worry is the postie for sure  , any that use or know about this site will be so happy if they think someone on there round is ordering online

    It could very well be a member of royal mail, I know a lot of people who work there and they are all the type to smoke someones post or open it if they suspected it was drugs, though they had to suspect it was drugs for them to open it in the first place? Its more than likely though customs just opened it, as they do then send the package on, probally too bousy to be dealing with such small amonts though just gets written up

    cant see postie sending the package on wouldnt he just throw it....unless he had a sick sense of humor...
    <br/>
    im not so worried about getting in trouble as i cant see them coming and kicking my door down for such small amounts its more the hassle of finding a new address to send my next orders to :/

    I can only speak from my experience so take it with a pinch of salt. :-*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think posties get a bad wrap. I see mine every day and he's a nice chap, I'm a good judge of character (I like to think! :P) and he wouldn't steal a thing, he's the family type. Poor chap just has to do an epic delivery route with a huge bag to lug around for probably minimum wage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe the sorting offices are where dodgy things go on? When they do an x-ray analysis they do it on a pallet of mail at a time and spotting a small amount is hard, but not impossible. Using sniffer dogs is impractical and never heard of them being used. I don't actually know how much UK domestic mail actually gets scanned or scrutinized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would guess they mainly focus on international mail, I also guess they find a lot of contraband all the time in small quantities, MOM isn't new, the easiest explanation is it just gets destroyed, there's be little point following up on it for a small quantity.
    <br/>
    Also weed is probably hardest to hide of all drugs, pre-ground, vacuum sealed in a thin envelope has been very successful for me, even for high risk countries like The Netherlands and USA (not through SR tho). But
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also I think the Unions or the RM have changed all their delivery routes and drops slightly in some places due to health and safety nonsense about postmen doing their backs in and getting injured (which doesn't surprise me!). I'm sure I got a leaflet through about it a few months back.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also the Olympics, there must be increased security, especially for London, unless they are stupid, its the only reason this would delay things no matter how much they harp on about 'logistics'. Blame it the Olympics, it's everyone's RL excuse these days! :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's their clearnet statements for personal mail currently:
    <br/>
    http://www.royalmail.com/2012/personal
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should probably have a careful look round the packaging posts, find international / domestic often get mixed up on there but there's probably much more info somewhere on this. Limitless would know.  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Royal Mail are definitely slow recently and getting worse, first class sent in the morning used to be next day 90% of the time. But it gets there in the end for 99.9% of the time. This is getting slower all the time for me tho. Birthday cards are a mare recently! &gt;:( Used to know they would turn up on the day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your ordering in the UK mail is pretty much guaranteed to get there eventually. If a domestic small order doesn't get there, keep a close eye on the vendor. [I'm sure people will disagree with me tho].
    <br/>
    For international airmail, more like 80-90% is my experience if the packaging is pro.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know people obsess about receiving pretty un-flattened buds, but I don't mind pre-ground, so long as its decent bud.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Without revealing too much, decent printed labels imitating a professional company address stickers, vacuum sealing, pre-ground is best and can even be sent in a window envelope imitating a letter. Some examples of packaging I've had are fairly bad in some cases.

    thanks for the in depth answer ! if i knew how to do it id give you +1 for effort youll have to leave that with me lol
    <br/>
    i got to say the labels on this empty package are shit and i will tell the vendor so if he ever checks his inbox ,as far as im concerned they made the package stand out...i mean who puts the return address in the top lh corner and the delivery address in the bottom rh corner ? also the labels where tiny compare to the envelope that contained a dvd box it just looked wrong.
    <br/>
    back in the day i had a postie used to intercept unsigned credit cards we had 1000`s of em but he got caught cos he couldnt be bothered to deliver the rest of the mail either.....i know if i was a postie and could intercept narcs from a known address i probly would, i mean what can i do complain to RM or LE ?
    <br/>
    i have an abundance of buds and only ever buy exotic hash an hallucingons as a rule but im gonna be looking for a new delivery addy for sure :(

    I once had 5,000 valium and 500 Nitraz seized by customs and they didn't do a thing. After a few months a letter arrived saying it was seized, it would be destroyed and I was free to appeal if I wished. It was sent to an address with no criminal history and nothing ever came of it but I am sure the address was flagged up for a while and suspect packages were watched out for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suppose it depends what it is. Even 5,000 diazepam is still Class C. If it was heroin it would have been a different story!!!
