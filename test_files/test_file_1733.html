    Hi there, have a package coming from an overseas vendor and the latest word on tracking is that it's 'Inbound into customs'. What does that mean? None of my other packages have that happened from overseas. Does that mean I'm fucked and should start packing and make a getaway or what? lol

    It depends from what country but inbound into customs is the usual.  I think China packs from a certain vendor right now are getting a very thorough look.  Also packages from the NL are always a red flag.  Lets just hope it says outbound in a couple of days.  I'm assuming you are from the USA.

    "inbound into customs" does not mean customs picked your package out of a line up because it looked suspicious. It basically means your package is going to get looked at just a little bit closer. Hopefully if the vendor knows what they are doing, all will go well.

    This happens either because of the country it was sent from, or sometimes just randomly.

    Was it a bulk order? Customs has no time to waste on little finds. They just chunk that shit in the trash and move on.

    People get promoted because of kilos, not grams.

    Yeah I think you're right. After looking at some of my previous orders from overseas they passed through customs as well so I'm not sure why I freaked out. I guess if it stays sitting there for a few days then I should worry right? The vendor is pretty good with his stealth and it's not the first time ordering from them so I think all should go well. I wouldn't say it was a bulk order but it wasn't small either. If it was seized I think it would be right on the threshold between personal and selling but after talking to a few ppl here I doubt it will get that far unless I'm very unlucky.

    Always be concerned.  If your regular postman isn't the person to ask you to sign for your package then don't sign and try not to even answer the door if you can help it.
