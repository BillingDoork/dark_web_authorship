    A little bit off topic, but with Festival season approaching I was wondering what the best way to conceal pills to get them into a festival undetected the police frequently go through the line entering the festival with sniffer dogs, Ive heard best way is to put your stash in a condom tie it in a knot and wash it clean then hide it on your person, any better theories?

    First of all smell proof it from those pesky dogs using some of this: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/3e10560aef

    Can easily be heat sealed with some hair straighteners. Similar, and just as effective in my mind, is 3M moisture ESD bags, look them up on ebay. Make sure it is heat sealable. Final step if you are being super stealth is to rub the outside down with some acetone.

    Then to conceal. My favorite method for this is to use a sack truck, google is your friend. Most festivals allow you to take these in to carry your stuff on. Simply remove the handle and you are left with a perfect tube in which to ram your stash in.

    Best of luck with your smuggling. Has worked for me every time.

    I would advise getting a fake beer stash can (the fosters one) and buying a couple of real fosters.. then just masking it in, no one would suspect that.  ;D
