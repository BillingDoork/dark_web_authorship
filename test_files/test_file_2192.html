    Alright, I know this has probably been covered but we've read through all of the stuck posts and a few more and have yet to find an answer to our questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We want to send via USPS but don't want to show our faces when we ship at the post office, unless for some reason this shouldn't be a problem. We were considering priority mail flat rate boxes (as some of our products contain up to 1000cc of NS with needles).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We assume it will be suspicious to wear leather gloves while handing off a package to the post office let alone have our faces on camera.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do the veteran sellers on SR avoid this and send parcels anonymously?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS: our shipping charges and prices will likely change once we figure this out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you all, we love SR! :-*

    No problem, yes the boxes really are flat rate, I use them for everything! (Not a vendor, I mean regular items lol).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What you can do is go to a PO and buy a bunch of the DCN stickers, then put them on your priority box, since they'd already be paid for (I think!).

    So you can drop off any package with a DCN sticker into a drop box, and they will scan the code right? I just shipped out my first couple orders, and I'm kinda nervous because they haven't shown up on usps's site yet. I dropped them off at like 12 in the afternoon today.

    They probably won't show up until they reach a major sorting facility. You really shouldn't even be checking them, yet. Tor or not, you should leave it alone unless a customer says it didn't show up... and even then, it should be at least a week from the drop-off day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yes, as long as the TOTAL PACKAGE WEIGHT is under 13 ounces, you can stick a DCN onto a small flat rate box or the like and it'll go just fine.

    +1 to this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I started I checked tracing constantly, though NOT from TOR. Regular web browser, www.packagemapping.com, a nice centralized tracking site that tracks a number of different courier packages but you never have to connect directly to the courier site (IE UPS, FedEx, etc). You can visually see where your package started, where it is right now, and where it's going. I'd agonize over little delays, get uptight around customs clearing time, lose my shit when it got pulled by customs for inspection, celebrate wildly when it cleared customs on the other side.
    <br/>
    Now, short of sending tracking info, I don't do anything with it unless the buyer contacts me.

    Hey guys, I'm new to SR as well, but definitely not new to mailing small packages.  Here are a few tips / info I've learned over the years:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - You can use usps.com to find your nearest self-service machine which prints out legitimate USPS labels you apply to your package.  You usually cannot pay with cash though, gift cards or rebate cards work well (VISA, AMEX, etc.).  You can also buy a "custom stamp" of any value, or buy lots of them for your actual postage cost once you figure it out, and then you can take those home and apply them to your packages before dropping them in a blue box if under 13oz.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - If you are using delivery confirmation, make sure to save the half you're supposed to rip off, and stick the barcode on to one of the package's/case's edges (NOT the middle, top left, or top right--usually they'll place it under the postage).  BUT -- BE SURE TO ADD THE EXTRA (75c now?) IN POSTAGE!  You can't just put a delivery confirmation label on there and expect the service without paying for it!  You might get lucky and they might scan it anyway, but probably more often they will return it to your return address (which is probably an uh oh).  One other thing if you are applying your own delivery confirmation barcode (instead of the post office or a self service machine or online where deliv. conf. is actually free):  If you just drop it in a blue box, most of the time you will not get any type of "tracking" information until after it is delivered, sometimes a day or two after.  It really depends on where it's processed, but if the number isn't initiated in the system at the beginning, it isn't going to get updated along the way, so don't get worried if it isn't updating as you frantically click refresh every 5 minutes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - USPS used to offer free supplies, even delivered for free right to your mailbox, I'm not sure if they still do this but you can acquire all the same things at any post office for free.  (e.g. I got several hundred yards of "priority mail" ~3"x1.5" stickers just for the hell of it, along with all different types of boxes, envelopes, and ~200 of the green delivery confirmation tags).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope this wicked wise wisdom of mine clears up some of your questions :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way, I am also going to start vending a few different things, so if I end up conducting business with anyone who comes across this post, consider it an added comfort that I'm no shipping newbie ;)  Thousands of eBay transactions have taught me well.

    Any suggestions for boxes over 13oz though? I'm shipping somewhere in the range of 1-2 liters of fluid. I've seen fex ex drop boxes and have considered UPS but it seems everyone around here prefers USPS.

      Hey guys, I'm new to SR as well, but definitely not new to mailing small packages.  Here are a few tips / info I've learned over the years:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      - You can use usps.com to find your nearest self-service machine which prints out legitimate USPS labels you apply to your package.  You usually cannot pay with cash though, gift cards or rebate cards work well (VISA, AMEX, etc.).  You can also buy a "custom stamp" of any value, or buy lots of them for your actual postage cost once you figure it out, and then you can take those home and apply them to your packages before dropping them in a blue box if under 13oz.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      - If you are using delivery confirmation, make sure to save the half you're supposed to rip off, and stick the barcode on to one of the package's/case's edges (NOT the middle, top left, or top right--usually they'll place it under the postage).  BUT -- BE SURE TO ADD THE EXTRA (75c now?) IN POSTAGE!  You can't just put a delivery confirmation label on there and expect the service without paying for it!  You might get lucky and they might scan it anyway, but probably more often they will return it to your return address (which is probably an uh oh).  One other thing if you are applying your own delivery confirmation barcode (instead of the post office or a self service machine or online where deliv. conf. is actually free):  If you just drop it in a blue box, most of the time you will not get any type of "tracking" information until after it is delivered, sometimes a day or two after.  It really depends on where it's processed, but if the number isn't initiated in the system at the beginning, it isn't going to get updated along the way, so don't get worried if it isn't updating as you frantically click refresh every 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      - USPS used to offer free supplies, even delivered for free right to your mailbox, I'm not sure if they still do this but you can acquire all the same things at any post office for free.  (e.g. I got several hundred yards of "priority mail" ~3"x1.5" stickers just for the hell of it, along with all different types of boxes, envelopes, and ~200 of the green delivery confirmation tags).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I hope this wicked wise wisdom of mine clears up some of your questions :)
      <br/>

    Most of us "prefer" USPS because they need a WARRANT to open your package. UPS/Fedex etc are private companies and can open your box just because they feel like it. USPS still being considered a Federal entity needs a warrant to do so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is news areticle floating around recently of a package REAKED of marajuana. PO workers call the local police.  The local police came to take the box and open it. Postal inspector stepped in and told them (the police!) that they CAN NOT open it with out a warrant, and told the police it would be a federal crime for them to remove the package from the building. The police gave it back. And the package went on its way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now what the police did...was follow the package and then get a local search warrant for the house it was delivered too. So dont take too much comfort in this warrant thing, but it is way better then UPS or any other privatly help delivery co. will give you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that said there is unfortunatly (that I know of) NO WAY to ship something over 13oz with out going inside to a Post Office. You must hand them anything over 13oz "over the counter:. Thank you Sept 11th. :\

    Yeah, but if you're shipping within the US, you can stuff 70 pounds into the small flat-rate box. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm not sure there actually IS anything that weighs 70 pounds, that would fit in one of those. But hey, if it fits...

    While this IS true...you still need to take it inside and had it over the counter to a live person. I do not have what the repercussions are if you don't but I know every blue box I have ever laid my eyes on has this written all over it. (and I have seen a few)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dont ever have anything over 13oz, but geeze...if I did I certainly wouldnt want it to end up in some dead letter office because I dropped it in a blue box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...this is more a "security precaution" on USPS part then anything else. Double checking it isnt a bomb I guess. Apparently terrorists are unable of making a mail bomb that weighs less then 13oz  :-X

    How about some updated information on this (IN NO WAY AM I SAYING USE ANYTHING OTHER THAN USPS IN THE USA)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPS, FedEx, DHS, etc are Common Carriers and bound by that status. There are a lot of extra rules, regulations, and laws they have to follow. They can not just open a package they think has contraband in it. These are different if it is a Private Shipping company, they can open a package. You will need to look up the two and see the rest of the differences.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Found information that may be of interest.

    <blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
     The California Supreme Court in People v. McKinnon (1972) 7 Cal.3d 899, 909, held that when police have probable cause to believe that a package consigned to a common carrier contains contraband, police are entitled to either search it immediately without a warrant or hold it until they obtain a search warrant.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In this instance, the officer seized the package. So far, so good. But when the officer took the closed package back to the station without opening it, he was required to obtain a search warrant to search the package. Because that didn't happen, the Appellate Court here suppressed the evidence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In another decision, People v. Pereira (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1106, defendant mailed a package via a private shipping company. An employee became suspicious of the package, opened the box and found a teddy bear with abnormal stitching. The employee called police. Officers arrived a few hours later and cut into the bear and found marijuana. In that case, the court found there were no exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless search and suppressed the evidence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When you, as a trained officer, smell the odor of contraband coming from a package or location, that smell creates probable cause to get a warrant. Plain smell does not justify a warrantless search. Plain smell is not the equivalent of plain view.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There may be a temptation to read the above and conclude it is fine to search a closed container when a shipping company calls and you smell the odor of narcotics. DON'T! Get a warrant. The law in this area is trending towards eliminating the ability to immediately open the package when you receive it from the common carrier. Take the extra time to get a search warrant. You won't regret it.
