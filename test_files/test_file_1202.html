    - If American and recieving via USPS, always use a real name that is associated with the said name's address. USPS tracks mail for accuracy based on the addressee.

    [NOTE: experience from directly personal situations involving illegal/controlled substances are limited, as I only operate legally as a legal business - Yes, I pay taxes on income/sales :P one of the few non-offender vendors. Friends have a lot of knowledge on the topic, and I have a chance once in a while to try some things out. I generally don't actually buy any drugs, but enjoy the ocassional experience when offered. What I do have a lot of experience in is with legal mailing of chemicals, which can be suspicious on various levels such as packaging, return address, and contents - may be sent to health Canada for analysis, which is great, as it's free assurance of purity and analytical data. Not great if your buying other stuff.]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NAMES/1ST LINE ON ADDY
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If Canadian you can use any name, a fake business name (Corey's Beeswax). Source: Lots of CP friends. Mail is delivered based on property address dictated by the unit, apt or house number and suite number. (my friend has been using a very obviously fake name to get orders and they come everytime... and I mean ridiculous. James Huxtable, John P. Smith. Retarded.. not reatarded enough to warrant reporting to the station supervisor. 'nuff said)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    REMOTE/RURAL CANADA
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *NWT, YUKON, NUNAVUT, RURAL*: clearnet weed sellers budbuddy.biz report high instances of disappearing ail in these remote areas (Xpresspost). If you live here, ensure you choose the vendors with utmost discretion, and grow your own weed, sine it's the easiest thing to detect due to bulk and pungent smell. Consider contacing a small-med sizd vendor about a customer stealth order to conceal contents beyond outside packaging. Larger vendors don't have the time to make custom arrangements for small orders unless specified.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MARIHUANA PLANT MATERIAL (EXCL. SEEDS/STEMS)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Weed. It's illegal, but carries no harsh penalties in Canada. The Canadian Criminal code spells it with an H that makes most think "W..T..F..?!" with a quick squint. It's value relative to weight and gram is extremely low. It gives off a strong smell. Large volumes + strong smell = human detection during sortation. Will your postal carrier report it to the supervisor? Well, maybe, but it's more likely you will receive your package or the mail carrier will steal it. signature req'd is something I'd personally use if you trust the vendors discretion but not your postal worker. Ever since CP sequenced there mail system and underwent transformations a few weeks ago, 80-90% of workers hate there jobs, disability claims in the GTA increased by 50-100%, and morale is LOW. All they want to do is get done with the extra work theye been given so they can arrive home hours later than they did previously. Crystal meth? who care? in the mailbox it goes.. a HP of kush, doorstep. Some pills for the weekend? mailbox. Why? cuz its getting dark and the supervisor has likely gone home and you dont wanna work overtime unpaid reporting something that truly doesn't matter (subjective, but a majority truly don't care).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DOMESTIC ORDERS (DELAYED, SUSPECT LE?, MISSING?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Domestic Canada. RCMP has a lead? you order from the vendor whos under investigation? package will be stopped on request of the PO supervisor, who follows a corporate instruction to intercept the package. This usually only happens to tracked orders. If your patient, just use standard mail. Has your tracked package got intercepted and you don't have postal worker insiders at your PO? RCMP likely took it, doesn't need to hear your BS because they know you ordered a bit of dope, but your not the problem and you'll deny everything anyway. Local Police may be informed, but don't expect contact or even that your address is flagged [REMINDER: Canada Urban/Suburban only; if your jurisdiction is policed by the RCMP and them alone, you are more likely to be contacted; same for bulk orders. oz+; 50+ street pills 90+ prescription. Still only a maybe]. VERDICT: You won't receive something, you'll never hear from LE, and expect the legal demise of the vendor from whom you transacted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what does it take to get a red flagged address with actual attention put into observing incoming mail, or even get flagged at all formally or informally? Who knows, but they give the strong impression of "AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FO DAT SHIT". And really, who does? A small percent, so don't take my words too comfortably. All my knowledge (and with CP it's a lot... I mean many friends hen I say I know CP workers across the GTA).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    COUNTRIES OF HIGH RISK OF SUSPICION/SEIZURE (as imports to Canada)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Destination: Canada (Important, as INDIA has far less interceptions in the US than Canada. My guess is Canada's odd demand for ketamine, and India's high volume, high quality product. This probably led to a crackdown, where it was then noted by CBSA that man seniors wer buying pharmaceuticals sent from India, and now this wasn't a legal/drug issue, but a health risk for Canadians, as India's regulations are generally good and getting better to satisfy international sellers since they rely on Exports from cheap labour and a massive population).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CHINA: Known producer and exporter of rationally designed, new RCs. The past year has seen a change of chinese government policy on chemical manufacturers, setting high penalties to people who offend the new laws. The laws and enforcement focus on exportation of substances to countries where they are illegal nationally, or by WHO. China wants to keep a polished image, and they do, they just use chromium to ppolish it, acetone to remove it when it gets out of style, and naptha/CFCs evaporated into the atmosphere to produce new laquers and stains for their analogous 'image'. Good news tho, seems Customs Canada lost interest a bit in China as they probably got tired of openng, testing and repacking/shipping legal Chinese imports, which the vast majority actually is. Out of 5 orders in a year post-cbsa intercept and letter (wanted to get some codeine but the Doctor who wrote the enclosed script was not licenced to prescribe in Canada. I no longer buy illegals, just smoke weed ocassionally.), I've not received an open/tampered or what occurs in most cases, a CBSA resealment tape with a watermark you can't miss unless your blind as a muthafuckin bat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Netherlands: Oooo a package with Nederland on it. This country probably has the highest percent of illicit substances exported in contrast to legal (wooden shoes comes to mind as a netherlands export - and I don't see anyone wearing them), maybe some engineering material and metallurgic products, but these imports are generally declared on an Import Declaration form ahead of time. I doubt you declare you MDMA formally, although under the right sophistication it could be a mastermind idea generating the conceiver of plans or the guy he bragged at the bar about, millions (not suggested unless smart and modest; not smart and a bit extra smart due to over-confidence/cockiness like myself. -SOrry last sentence was redundant based on the target audience and the implication that thay'd head my advice, an Internet random with his mom's old work computer and a cheap beer, or a kid ith rich parents, or possibly a 20-something y/o successful businesman. I won't say cuz it won't be believed regardless of which I said.

    CBSA NOTICE OF SEIZURE
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So you got a letter in the mail from a Border Agent =D they've done their job by opening a package with potentially regulated material and did their due diligence. Before you read half and tear it up, respect it, the Agent spent 5 weeks writing it, and sometimes 6-7 on other accounts. You can take the 20mins to read the whole thing and learn some things......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    .... OK so you learnt that it's no big deal but are you red flagged? is Constable Tom using a baby monitor to wake up right when you do to start his daily investigation on your criminal ass? Find out by searching for walkie-talkies and baby monitors, or simple speaker looking devices (microphones). OK, constable Tom checks out.. Is Staff Sergeant Steven Priyivkathara on your case? Sounds like your in a urban area here Equal Opportunity Employers take diveristy seriously by ensuring a 20% interview rate of qualified Mohammed's, Tanayay's, Mike Xianghua's, and Bill Huxtable's. Urban areas are great for buyers, as they offer high volume mail routes, many, many business and a mail carier with more stress than Fort MacDonald, BC (breakfast club, not the province). In Fort ___, BC the mail carrier likely has less on their mind and may focus in on your package for some close observance. a 1cm tear can reveal as much of the interior contents as a thongs reveals an ass, so it might arouse suspicion, but they won't get off on you for it.

    GENERAL INFO FOR EVERYONE FROM SCOTLAND TO GREENLAND, HYRULE TO LUCY.. in the sky with diamonds and other expensive shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I covered mostly Canada, and it might interest ya'll to take a look at ho the place with a leaf on our flag and vast forests of syrup d'erable sprout at a moderate rate. Or not. But here's something to take home, be it a cave, clouds, house, loft, igloo, dung n straw shack or under the beautiful earthly sky. Here's to all of you who use SR to safely purchase products that can be researched before purchase, and is much harder to get convicted for than chillin at Freebasin Freddy's shady complex unit, where he's quick to show you his brick of moist, freshly cut dope, with a nearby firearm in case his delusions perceive you an evil being or, god forbid, he kills a cop, realizes the consequences of that and your still there waiting for him to get his scale that he was supposed to get 10mins ago in the kitchen and 4 mins ago in his roomates dresser. Run. Fast. You've witnessed a crime that you should and will comply with cops for, Freddy was gonna shoot yo ass like poor community wellness Clarence, bloodstained on the ground, in his last breathes of agony from Hollow Tips. Hollow TIPS! HOLLOW TIPS, NIGGA... hollow tips. Before this gets long enough to publish on Amazon Kindle for $0.99 I'm gonna keep it free by telling no more stories and getting down to the important shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -In general, avoid, or have a lot of knowledge about the topic of international importing of controlled materials, ordering from Interpol red-flagged (as drug producers and exporters) nations such as netehrlands, China, Pakistan (even with arrangements, watchout for the high rate of inactive pills or worse: active with chemicals and impurities lab rats don't desere to suffer from.), India (Their pharms are usually good quality, but avoid areas of dispatch bordering pakistan and Bangledesh unless you're buying opium/heroin, as adulterating this product would be plan stupid with all those poppy fields. Just know you support enemies of the West when you buy h from middle east. Asia is ideal, and I can't decide if Purdue and other big pharma is better than al quaida, but its something to consider when you send your money abroad.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Unless you have a mutual trust built up over months (IE $10,000 product, with vendors trust of advancing your shipment before payment; think of it as a % of transactional value with the vendor, base your trust on your own research/intelligence, and don't g out of escrow unless your transaction is less than 10% of value what you ordered from the same person in the previous 6 months. - general guidelines, that I follow myself with confidence)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Mitigating the LE intercept risk, and the paper/packet trail of money and communications.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use PGP encryption for questionably legal or illegal substances, always. (privnote I advocate strngly against and use plaintext over privnote anyday. I recommend the same, but PGP is better than plaintext which is better than privnote. Why? because who controls it and who knows if your message destructs after opening. Do they run a disk override x5+ after you read it? Will they comply with LE for free? for $10K? For a careeer in Federal defence and cmputer security (the latter would be tempting, no)? Fuck privnote - vendors (I've seen some do it already) please don't accpt privnote and make it clear in your policy. When you do accept it, msg the buyer with a polite warning for their own security. PGP is easy as fuck once you get it down and secure as it gets (I'm no geek up to the minute on encryption, but its damn good, if soemthings better spare me the details cuz there's always new tech shit).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use PGP for sensitive or incriminating info (exceptin: terrorists, using PGP will bait you out, so always us plaintext as the enforcers will never expect that! Haha! I don't usually help terroists but a tip here and there shouldn't harm anyone. When you scrmable your words p that looks suspect and theyll be onto you, but taking about fertilizer in normal text is what farmers do all teh time and they get no attention. Drug traders: Stick with PGP as plaintext is bait for drugs cuz of tecnology esp. in the US by the DEA that goes hard on drugs but easy on terror plots. You want to be a martyr? don't use PGP or Allah will smite you for using western technologies that they can crack like a door with a key left in. I don't support terrorism but I feel you're mislead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Order from non-producing countries. For example the UK, not much is synthesized/produced there but there are lots of vendors that import into the UK and do a 100-200% markup to resell internationally with high success rates due to lack of statistics that link the UK to mega-exportation of drugs. US-Canada and Canada-US is generally used as a limitation for buyers and sellers alike as mail is rarely checked unless packaged halfassed or otherwise suspicious looking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Order pharmaceuticals from FRANCE for value ands security as their medical social expnditures are some of the msot generous, allowing for cheap prices, if not free pharmaceuticals to be purchased after a script is attained. Also France is a nation des cafes au lait et le bain baguette, your package should slide by as a tourist ho takes a lot of pictures and liked the eiffel tower souvenirs which are inherently thick when to scale, or even with a scale skewed by 50% on the thinnest side. Popular products fro france are codeine and modafinil, so not for you hardcore users and weekend warriors (well not a 1 stop shop anyway), but for the average office worker, vive la France! Where you can get mild cognitive enhancers and a codeine buzz with little risk of seizure, and if a seizure does happen its nothing to worry about. Despite the schedule codeine has that lsts it in the same category as heroin, most progressive countries see it for what it is, a drug liberally prescribed and legal OTC in many countries. Codeine is harmless where its legal and easily extracted from harmful ingredients like APAP. But in the US where every drug is like a bullett ina chamber, regulations pushed its otc use with the addition of potentiaing antihistamines and other harmful substances in the overdoses taken to get high.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, and continuing from my last paragraph, Americans, I regret to inform you that at this time you are the unlucky nation to be a drug user/dealer or manufacturer. You have to tread carefully when when working this trade  and alays stay informed. The reason is Nioxn (I think) and the earlier formation of the DEA which unlike the RCMP in Canada or local police in Germany or South Korea, thyre dedicate to one thing, and 1 thing only: Drugs, and subsequent seizure, prosecution, and judicially enforcing economically catastrophic penalties that make me look south with disgust at the treatment of America to it's own citizens. It's a shame, but before you walk to your dealer's house in a rage thinking about it, SR is still a great resource to circumvent unfair minimum penalties and life-long tainting of your reputation and your ability to provide, causing stress that is a viscious cycle of reactive enforcement of the law, which puts offenders in situations that encourage or induce drug use, either directly or indirectly, but systemically, the US government is a group of mostly ill-willed politicians who see proactivity only of use in children and teenagers. The DEA officers should have to udnergo a 3 month paid drug addiction educationprogrgam where they are given drugs in amounts that cause low physical harm, but positive psychoactive effects, and subsequently be locked up ina  typical State cell drug a detox period here they no longer hae access to the drug theyve become physically dependent to. Seems harsh, but they would sign and agree to the details and in contrast to the lives they destroy everyday, its a drop in the bucket for harshness, in fact its some fo the softest job training relative to what effect their position shave on society. Empathy is needed, and proactive programs, and I urge anyone with a vast wealth in the US to create your on organization (not for profit, as capitalism is part of the reason for this mess, and you can legally evade taxes on revneues or 'charitable donations').

    Be Safe, Watch Out and help others, and kee it simple unlike my story that should be on Amazon for $0.99 when I edit and upload it!

    In the meantime, donations can be made in bitcoin to encourage my lazy ass to share my wealth of knowledge more. every 0.001btc counts and will get m excited watching the confirmations =D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers and stay safe!

    Long live SR and the circumvention of the inherent violence that drug trade has been associate with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Donations greatly appreciated and will go towards proactive drug abuser help programs (hopefully in the US)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did you like my essay on Safe SR use for the US, Canada, and Interntional? any dontation amount is appreciated. If you didn't like my info, please rant about my wordy stories as repies and try to do a negative transaction from my bitcoin address for compensation of your wasated time youc oudle spent deciding whose got the best H for the money and reviewing tests of purity and frum reviews for current crystl stocks, for that I'm truly sorry, I only wanted to keep your attention rather than boring you with regulations and no opinions or personal experience with some puns and other humour styles that I use when I'm up all night wtih back pain waiting fro the severity to warrant taking painkillers. And ah that time has come. To all, evn if you passioantely hate me, I thank you for hearing my advice an encourgage you to help thers on the SR community forums, which is a priceless knowledgebase of good intentioned peple lke yourselves who try to help others so long as your questin isn't posted without the use of proper grammar and stupid (I mean fucking stupid as a newborn half born, by a brave dug free mother IQ level. You'll just get ripped on like the idiot you are; rightfully so, because certain questions asked prove your too lay to use SR). And I'm too lay to realise before writng hat you won't get this far reading or you wouldnt have those stupid questions.

    My Bitcoin Wallet address for charitable donations (Sum of Us). I will actually donate money sent here to a Sum of Us, an ethics watchdog that relies on publicism of unethical business acts, and boycotts/petitions. Check them out! theyve done a lot to change the sickening decisions of some big multi-nationals. I encourage anyone to sign up for their email, where you can sign petitions that actually make a difference.
