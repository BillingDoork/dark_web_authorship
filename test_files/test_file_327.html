    this site provides us with tracking for all  of the major mail services especially usps.  any how anyone use this? if so is it a good idea to put in a email you set up just for this to get updates sent this way you do not keep checking tracking?
    <br/>
    or does this show too much interest?
    <br/>
    let me know please anyone with experience with this and similar sites
    <br/>
    thank you in advance and i always offer +! for good responses!

    i really dont think it is a good idea, then you have absolutely no plausible deniability if they know youre getting email updates about the package
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but i am kinda paranoid and stick to the better safe than sorry method
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i believe recently people have said the tracking through tor was a myth so i would just check the tracking using tor to be safe. at least if you are checking on the package through tor it could be the sender or something, but if they confiscate your computer and check email accounts then it would be obvious you were expecting the package and knew what was inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i dont think it is suspicious to check the tracking every couple days to see when to expect the package. no need to do it more frequently, just need to have some patience
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do you really need the email updates - i dont see much reason for the potential risk. if you do use the updates definitely use an email address that is not connected to you, maybe like a tormail... certainly not one you register for like all the major providers

    Sorry guys, maybe I'm missing something, but what's the big fuss with the tracking status? Just be patient, you will get high soon enough ;D.  I trust my vendor, if I feel it should have arrived, I will PM him accordingly. Enough of the tracking nonsense. It's either coming or not.

    well i keep all tor and all SR info on memory stick and i am a computer tech, So i clean my computer hard drive better than i clean my house. lol. I got my registered mail. and i was going to set up a email through tor and only check it through tor. with that site that is not usps but a site that tracks all trackable mail.. anyhow I never have tracked through tor i would go to local coffee shop or something next town over if its running that late! i never used tor because sometimes it gives fictiscious locations like A1. ha what are you in steak sauce land. I mean that could draw negative attention tracking with that? i think so atleast!
    <br/>
    well thanks for input!
    <br/>
    keep it coming&gt; for further inquires

    I don't know... I'm a web application engineer, I highly doubt a government run postal system would spend money watching for TOR traffic on package tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's highly possible the NSA/DEA is running data mining algorithms, where TOR is a flag, to detect fraud, terrorism and criminal activity. But it is highly unlikely that this data would be shared with local police with the intent to arrest personal-use drug users.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Governments/police outside of the highest levels have pretty unsophisticated technology. The highest levels only care about kilos not grams.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's probably as simple as not getting 20 packages a month when you normally got 1-2. Or a bunch coming from odd places like the middle east, south east asia or NL.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stop worrying about tracking packages. Even better, just buy small amounts and use regular non-express mail.

    wrt emails, couldn't you just use tor to access something like mailinator? Seems like it'd be a pretty anonymous way of getting the email updates.
