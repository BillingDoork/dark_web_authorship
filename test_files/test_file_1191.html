    So, there are various vendors that say things like "bulk amounts please contact me" or other such things. I imagine some domestic shippers might be willing to ship internationally but at a higher cost. I assume that these deals are made in private or through email. I'm unclear on how this can be accomplished while still paying the proper % to SR? I mean we all want to support this market place and doing back end deals won't help anything.
