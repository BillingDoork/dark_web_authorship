    I would assume the list goes something like: (excluding South American Countries)
    <br/>
    Netherlands&gt;&gt;China&gt;&gt;Belgium&gt;&gt;Germany
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But i have no clue. What are your opinions?
    <br/>
    Is Belgium worse then Germany? or am i mislead about Germany's drug production? I was thinking Germany would be slightly safer?

    Im from high security country with strict customs and had no problems with Germany. If i could make every order from there i would. Netherlands stands for it's reputation and i have never received anything from there.

    Netherlands seems to stand in a league of it's own for how heavily mail from there is scrutinized. After that, i'd say China and after that, I have no idea at all :)

    I believe that China is low risk for international shipping.  It is the only country that I can think of where I can ship 10lbs of huge crystals to the USA in a box and actually have it arrive.  You could never imagine how many kilograms I ship to the US Monday through Saturday.  Try doing that from another country. ;)

    That stands to reason I guess; the US and China have a good trading relationship. Here in Ireland, mail from China is very heavily scrutinized!

    You are correct.  Belgium too.  It's just because they bother border NL and NL is where a ton of drugs are produced because of the VERY lax drug laws, even for manufacturing.

    I was thinking with the massive recent Belgium bust and the fact that we probably get much more German mail. Germany would be a tad safer no?

    I couldn't tell you which is "safer" or less "flagged" because I don't know.  I do know that they bother border the Netherlands and a lot of drugs get shipped from both of them which is no secret to customs and postal inspectors.

    If you come from some EU countries( Scandinavia, Denmark, Germany) NEVER! order anything in the US or South America.
    <br/>
    Because of EU regulations everything is RIPPED open , Taxed, controlled...

    You could order 1ton of hash by UPS in the netherlands and the risk is lower than for a 1g order in the us :)

    Cameroon is by far the worst, mail can take over a year to get too and if its a parcel it will be opened, if any value is found they will steal it. These are facts readily available. Learn from my mistakes.
