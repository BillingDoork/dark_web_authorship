    Hi guys, there is a UK company now who have lockers scattered around in different locations where you can get your parcels sent,  you can also get international deliveries sent there also and most important part of all is that they sign for the parcel for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only problem is you need to pre-pay your locker with a debit or credit card, is there any way of obtaining a card capable of making an online payment with fake details? WorldPay is the payment processor I believe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sounds great providing you can somehow credit your account anonymously!

    Pre-paid credit card should do it, UKash Neo might work as all you need is e-mail &amp; a phone number &amp; pay cash to load up card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem is that you'd need to pick  up the key, or have an address to get it sent to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still could be a possibility, let us know if you can get it set up.

    You type in your postcode into the find your nearest locker and it will show you a list of local lockers nearest to you. You make a payment via debit/credit card of £2.50 prior then get your parcel shipped to the address given, it is then signed for and placed in a locker for you to pick up at a convenient time, when package arrives there you receive a text message or email to let you know its ready for collection and give you a digit code you type in at the locker and it opens up for you!  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously you would get a non-registered pay as you go sim card to use for the mobile number and a fake email address, the hardest part is paying the £2.50 to be able to use the locker.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only thing is if police knew about what was in there and were waiting for the person to come and open the parcel but I'm sure you could think of something like someone asked you to do it for them as they were busy and offered some money, not really thought of that part but wouldnt mind giving it a go providing I could get a prepaid card without registering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another good thing is if one gets seized, just burn that address and use another! :)

    I believe payment must be done by a visa/mastercard.

    I mentioned earlier about police might sit and watch locker but as long as you dont order a stupid amount like a kilo of heroin I can't imagine them sitting there waiting for someone.

    Bad idea in my opinion. You lose almost all deniability and have used a false identity, to make it worse still.
    <br/>
    There's also an increased theft risk for packages without delivery confirmation.

    I have looked in to it, and I think its a valid idea. For anonymity you can use a prepaid virtual credit card, they are available on SR under money.
    <br/>
    And regarding decreased anonymity, I dont think that would be the case.. In the UK, a relatively small order would not warrant anything beyond a seizure. If a parcel is being sent to MyByBox, the LE do not know who ordered the box (where as they would have a pretty good idea when its being delivered to your house).
    <br/>
    It seems unlikely that LE would spend the resources of even one police officer sat watching a mail box for even one day. I personally think that using this over a PO box would be more secure.

    Yes I also think it is a good idea, I didn't know you could get prepaid virtual cards on here, that sounds perfect!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes I can't see LE sending someone to sit in a car park all day for packages up to 100g but I can't be certain on this, also I dont think you send it to MyByBox which is great, Im sure it is just addressed to your name then "John Smiths Car Sales" or something like that. Creating a PO box I believe would be more dodgy as you need ID etc to get one and also they're are people around when you have to pick up, MyByBox is just a locker with digital code you tap in and you open door and pick up parcel and go, you could do it at 3am when no-one is around!

    Anyone ever seen those "earn £30 for 30 minutes work" in Newsagent's windows?
    <br/>
    They have them all over in parts of London.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's what these are. They open a box with false info, then pay some poor sap to go pick up the package from the locker. If they get their collar felt, the owner of the box walks away and the person who picked up the gear gets all the grief.
    <br/>

    I'm not suggesting anyone does this of course. That'd be wrong. mmm'kay?

    Thanks for bringing this up. I'm gonna give this a propper trial over the next week or so. Put a thread in the security board also http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121348

    Found a dropbox litterally 10 minutes drive away. COULD be ideal. All depends on their "scanning" "sniffing(?)" methods.

    Sounds like a good idea, my nearest box is at a SOLICITORS pratice lmao but yeah that thing about sniffing and opening whatever they just have to put that in there you know so it seems like they are going be preventing such things like this happening. They are not going to take a sniffer dog round all the different boxes are they, anyway thats not there job. Once its got past UK customs its fine, they are the ones that are doing the "poking and sniffing".. not going to happen lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its a good idea because I think like anything under about 50g I think they would just seize anyway, depending on the product. Say if it was 100g of coke they would try and investigate, 50g of ketamine they are more likely to just seize it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is no chance on earth that the police would ever assign some officers to sit on a box 24 hours a day, imagine waiting 3 days, they just wouldn't authorize it. You could just say you answered an ad, received details of the location etc and where going to meet them after you had collected or something. No way it would stand in court, the package would have to be of large quantity though thats all im saying. Wouldnt be able to get letters sent there like the majority of the packaging methods are on SR

    Stuff goes to royal mail, they send it to mybox. I really don't think they are gonna "re-sniff" (?) lol...

    Well, I tested the service this week, and I have to say, security IS imo a serious issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All their mail goes to a sorting office, and is then sent to a dropbox. You get a code via email, or SMS, to let you know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I sent myself a handful of diazepam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Arrived, got SMS, went to the lockers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Goods were intact, and appeared to be un-tampered with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, the lockers are SHIT.
    <br/>
    Worse than those lockers you find at swimmimg pool/gym.
    <br/>
    Anyome with a crowbar or long screwdriver could pop one of those lockers in no time at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, yes. Service works, but imo your goods are extremely vulnerable when waiting in your box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Won't be using bybox again.

    There's no indication on the doors that they are in-use. I think the lockers are all slightly different, but my one had just a keypad, with a screen above it. Dark grey, with "mybybox" and "online deliveries here" plastered all over it.

    My thoughts too, my local locker is in a supermarket, they only hold your package 24 hours anyway so the majority of that time supermarket is going to be very busy and chances of someone trying to hack a locker open would of been slim I would of thought.

      Good to hear you've tested this android,

      Shame to hear the lockers are poor quality, but on the other hand don't they tend to be located in public places like supermarkets &amp; the like where theft/vandalism's unlikely to be an issue.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Also are there any indications on the lockers that they're in use &amp; have stuff in them? If not that'd minimise the chance of things being nicked from them

     My thoughts too, my local locker is in a supermarket, they only hold your package 24 hours anyway so the majority of that time supermarket is going to be very busy and chances of someone trying to hack a locker open would of been slim I would of thought.

    Then again, there's an issue there with CCTV.

    <br/>
    I'm considering this as an alternative to my current drop address but still undecided...

    Apart from any CCTV which might be at that location the lockers have a camera right above the video screen. If you're going to use this then scope out the area &amp; the lockers before hand and take precautions against cameras.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they only hold the parcels for 24 hours what happens to them after that time?
    <br/>
    If they're only there for a fixed period it increases the likelihood that LE could be sitting on it.

    tbh I see the whole thing as an unnecessary risk. I mean, it's an extra 'link' in the delivery process.
    <br/>
    I agree with others that they are hardly going to re-sniff etc after Royal Mail already have, but it's still an unnecessary extra destination.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My dropbox was near a harbour office. Crappy lighting, nothing much around except a harbour-master office.
    <br/>
    I didn't notice the camera myself, but I'm sure am embedded one is in there somewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the person who asked about it ....After the time is up, it goes back to the mybybox sorting office, and you have to re-arrange another drop.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suppose if my address were ever to be burned, I'd just make a deal with a neighbour. We're pretty friendly, been next-door for 20yrs+ etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think the order of preference for delivery should be, 1. Where you live. 2. Friend/neighbour. 3. Dropbox.

    I use a false name anyway. (which despite what loads of people think, makes zero difference in it being "flagged" during transit. In uk anyway).

    I went and checked out my local mybybox lockers to see what they are like, the lockers near me are actually very large and sturdy, much better than your typical local swimming pool lockers, these lockers were more like the lockers you get at coach stations or airports, i'm considering using this if my address ever gets flagged, seems like a much better alternative than sending to your address tbh

    This brings me back to the question of whether anyone has tried the Toronto-Area Drop Box service that I posted about a while ago. Time to bump that post up and see if we got any users and their experience, it sounds like it wold be a lot like your UK service without the shitty locker vulnerable to theft, the boxes look like polymer safe-style boxes and therefore quite secure against random attacks in the daytime, unless someone is aware of the valuable contents, here theres an ambitious addict, there is a way thru relentless attempts of attempting to open the box until 2 cop cars and 4 cops approach the psychotic fiend from the back saving your drugs from a psychotic hobo.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should email the company about your perceived worry of security vulnerabilities, the earlier in the expansion they get feedback, the less it will cost to replace the ever-growing number of boxes, should it become popular. If it's a pilot run they want your feedback in most cases and will consider it in the many meetings about the company's bottom line, and strategic changes to increase customer revenues and negate expenses. It would be noted that a vulnerability of security that is inherent n the design of the mailbox could easily become a recurring expense when damaged and in need of repair or replacement.

    I signed up for MyByBox a while ago and used up the 5 deliveries for £2 (40p for each delivery). As on their pay as you go tariff I would have to pay £2 for each delivery instead, I decided I'd be better off signing up again.

    As I understand it, the problem is with WorldPay, which is the payment processor for MyByBox and not with MyByBox itself. I've already emailed them but haven't received a response yet.

    I suspect Tor is the problem, so I would like to warn everyone to NOT USE TOR WITH MYBYBOX. I had no problems the first time but now I do have a problem as I already placed an order on Silk Road and it's marked in transit.

    It's worth mentioning that a valid mobile number is not required. So no need for 'burner phones' or anything like that. They will send you an email when your parcel is ready to be collected as well as a text.

    Yes, I believe this is what happened. I can't remember but I think I was redirected to WorldPay website to enter the card details. I was accessing it over Tor, so that is likely why I didn't pass the 'security threshold'.

    To be honest, I'm not surprised. All the packages I had received previously (including this one) could easily fit through a standard letterbox, so what legit reason could there be for using MyByBox? I don't believe it was completely random and checking 1 in 5 parcels seems too excessive.

    Sorry, my mistake, I know they e-mail you but I'd blanked on that as I tend to check the website as well as the e-mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Incidentally there is a good reason to check the website as it shows the path of your parcel from the point it is received and scanned by mybybox to when it is collected by you. If it takes longer than the next day to go in the box than that's a red flag.
    <br/>
    I had an occassion in the past when they received it, scanned it but didn't deliver to the box next day, there were a few error codes on the website over several days. In the end it all got very suspicious, I contacted them &amp; came to believe the cops had got involved so I abandoned the delivery. I was glad then that I had checked the website &amp; got an early indication something wasn't right.

    I see. I had a similar thing happen to me before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A package was meant to go inside my box on a Monday. I checked my email on Monday morning; however, there was no email from MyByBox with the collection code. A few hours later, I received an email from them informing me that the box in question is not working. I was asked to pick another box and did so. On Tuesday morning, there was still no collection code in my inbox. Then I received another email from them, this time telling me there's been a 'problem' with delivering the parcel to the alternative box. What the problem was, was not explained and I was told to wait. On Wednesday, I received the collection code and was finally able to collect the package, from the original box.

    I've received 2 packages from the EU to my box. One had no stealth at all. Anyway, you're lucky - when customs seize your package and it's only a gram or two, they will just destroy it; however, if MyByBox had opened it 'randomly' and found the goods, they might have contacted the police and if the local police had nothing better to do, they would have been waiting for you when you came to collect it.

    They tried 3 times to get you to comply. I bet you were talking to the pigs right then. I'll echo the above question. how much of what substance did you order?

       Sorry, my mistake, I know they e-mail you but I'd blanked on that as I tend to check the website as well as the e-mail.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Incidentally there is a good reason to check the website as it shows the path of your parcel from the point it is received and scanned by mybybox to when it is collected by you. If it takes longer than the next day to go in the box than that's a red flag.
       <br/>
       I had an occassion in the past when they received it, scanned it but didn't deliver to the box next day, there were a few error codes on the website over several days. In the end it all got very suspicious, I contacted them &amp; came to believe the cops had got involved so I abandoned the delivery. I was glad then that I had checked the website &amp; got an early indication something wasn't right.

      I see. I had a similar thing happen to me before.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      A package was meant to go inside my box on a Monday. I checked my email on Monday morning; however, there was no email from MyByBox with the collection code. A few hours later, I received an email from them informing me that the box in question is not working. I was asked to pick another box and did so. On Tuesday morning, there was still no collection code in my inbox. Then I received another email from them, this time telling me there's been a 'problem' with delivering the parcel to the alternative box. What the problem was, was not explained and I was told to wait. On Wednesday, I received the collection code and was finally able to collect the package, from the original box.

     Much the same as happened with me, got offered another box but wasn't notified when the package went in it, when I asked for the code they wanted me to call them when I was at the box so they could give me the code. When I turned that down they offerd a code that was only good for the next hour. Then they tried to get an address to deliver the parcel to me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Only explanation I could get was 'it issues'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After that I just wrote it off as lost and walked away, not worth walking ito a crowd of cops for.

    That is dodgy, i would but a BTC on the fact that th police would have been there when you went to collect it. The fact that they wanted to call you when you were at the box is a definite red flag, Its obviously to identify you to LE, That way you have less plausible deniability, When you refused it they offered you a pin only valid for an hour? Why? Because the police can afford to wait that long.  Both the things are not in their policy and went against it, So Seems like a red flag to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Issues? and they dont tell you what , Why not? If it was anything normal they would just say "box is broken" Problems with shipping etc, but no "issues".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As someone already said, I reckon most packages would be sent to a house, especially if they could fit through a letterbox , so why would anyone have something sent to a box, It seems cheap, But cameras are in place, and they search was in 5 packages, Seems too risky for me.
    <br/>
    could it be a honeypot?

    The drugs were in a jiffy bag, concealed as a legal item. Was cut open and resealed by MyByBox. I would suggest PM'ing vendors before ordering to MyByBox - to confirm the stealth is up to the standard.

    I am very interested to know how much oompaloompa was ordering as mybybox is the only option for me at the moment and that post has concerned me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been talking to some of the representatives at mybybox on the security procedures they have in place etc and if anyone would like the information please PM me directly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I honestly think mybybox is secure and they aren't checking one in five packages, they have delivery over 100,000 letters per day now I seriously don't think they are checking them all. I honestly think oompaloompa ordered a large amount and they probably do use some type of sniffer dog or something and it was caught or failing that the vendors stealth sucked.

    Not intending to disclose how much I ordered or of what substances (as this would tie me to a particular area), I will say that it wasn't massive quantities, wasn't something heavily watched for &amp; would have been in a letter or padded envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I now suspect, as some have said here already, that envelopes get a higher level of scrutiny as there'd be no need for them to go via Mybybox rather than via your letterbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't advise using mybybox for small 'envelope' deliveries, but if you do at least you've got an indication now of some of the tricks the police'll use to get you to pick it up while they're there. They're not likely to sit on the box for the whole 2 days it remains active so be aware &amp; think seriously about any deviation from mybybox's standard procedures.
