    I am wondering how long (properly) vacuum sealing cannabis might contain the odor from leaking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Based on what I've gathered from the tracking number, I am quite certain a postal worker at my local PO stole my package, but there is also a chance that it could just be sitting around the PO or on one of the postal trucks waiting for someone to find it. If that were the case, I am wondering what would be more likely; the package ends up getting discovered by someone cleaning or rather by someone eventually smelling the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The quantity was a half ounce, FWIW.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks,
    <br/>
    even more paranoid than I sound
