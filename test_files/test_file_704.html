    I understand the whole concept of escrow and buyer protection etc. But how are new sellers supposed to protect themselves from scamming buyers (who can just continuously create new buyer accounts every time they want to pull off a new rip) who, even with delivery confirmation, claim they did not receive the correct package/ received an empty package, etc? Is it proper to not allow buyers with less then 10 feedback to purchase? Good sellers who are new are vulnerable and it would be good if it was the norm to only allow buyers with a certain number of feedback, or who have been around for awhile, to order.

    Most vendors have a set of criteria in order for the buyer to stay in escrow. Mine for example is 10 or more transactions to stay in escrow. And a refund rate lower than 5%, if both of those criteria are not met then the buyer would have to finalize early.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if you are a new vendor you cannot ask buyers to finalize early unless you have over 50 transactions and been a member for over 30 days.Â  When I had started out I would refuse to sell to anyone with under 5 transactions, and then when I was able to ask for FE I changed my critera to over 10 transactions and under 5% refund rate.
