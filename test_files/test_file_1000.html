    I think DVD cases are a really outdated method of stealth. I would avoid them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, you definitely need to wait longer as stated above. US internal mail is slow as hell

    I heard that vegemite is actually banned by the FDA in the states.
    <br/>
    I know it's illegal to ship out of Australia without declaring to customs. Same with any food item.

    The person wrote on the parcel package that there was that food item in it.. Iv done the research now and No its not Illegal to bring it in the US. Some stores here actually sell it that mainly sell imported foods..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hoping it will show anyday..Even if they didnt by chance wanna let it come in, they would just take it out i Assume or return it to sender
