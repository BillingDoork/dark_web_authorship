    he had 2 packs shipped from china , the 1st posted on the 3rd of this month, and it shows that it still hasnt made it to the U.S?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    does the ems tracking websites sometimes be off with the tracking days and times and has a delay? because he has had a pack shipped and it said it never hit the U.S and it showed at his front door randomly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just wondering if it is normal for the pack that posted 2nd ( after the 1st ) to make it to the U.S into customs first before the actual 1st pack even landed in the U.S.... the 2nd pack only took 2 days to reach U.S and immediatley went into customs, he never had this happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    explain to him what to look for and what he should be worried about receiving the package, or if there should really be no worries at all on his end.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just wondering because he doesnt want to not be at the spot when its there if this tracking website is wrong and then be stuck having to go pick it up. just give him some pointers to help out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    all in all is it normal for the 2nd package sent after the 1st package to make it to the U.S and be sitting in customs and the 1st package to still not even make it to the U.S?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just trying to make sure he takes all safety precautions.

    It's only the true courier companies that have accurate tracking, EMS uses the standard postal system and tracking is often poor and may not even show delivery until a few days after it has actually happened. Plus post from China is slow at best.

    My orders from China usually don't post on the USPS website until they hit the sorting center by my house...sometimes it wont show on USPS's website at all.
