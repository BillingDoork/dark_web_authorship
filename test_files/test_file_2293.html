    I had a package I didn't get, Priority Mail, and the tracking said "undeliverable as addressed."
    <br/>
    What is likely to happen to this package now? If it returns, the return address will be fake. But what are the chances of apprehension? A person at the fake address, if it matches any real person's address (unknown) could open it, I suppose, and call in the Postal Inspectors(?) But more likely it just stays in the hands of the Post office.
    <br/>
    Will they open it, or just toss it?
    <br/>
    If they find drugs, is it a one-shot closed case, or do they investigate?

    Why was it undeliverable?  Did you use a fake name?

    if yu KNOW the address was correct, then this probably means a dog alerted to your package and it has been seized
    <br/>
    investigation? depends on the amount, etc. they'll probably try to reverse engineer it back to whoever sent the package. but i would advise you to assume you're being investigated and take action from there.

    The name on the pkg( fake or real) most likely has no bearing on anything.  Mail is delivered to ADDRESSES not NAMES.  You  will not know why it is undeliverable until/unless the pkg does show up later(which happens alot)  Unless...the sender took a scan or snapshot of the front of the pkg to show address/name/ret addr etc.  Undeliverable means they cannot discern the exact address of the intended receiver.  This happens often.  Either the sender transcribed the given address incorrectly or perhaps typo'd..or maybe the sender mess up and gave the shipper an incorrect address.  There are lots of reasons why it happens. They will try for a few days to figure it out.  You have the option of alerting  them that you are the receiver and straighten things out.t.  If they cant deliver t to the receiver or sender then it god to Dead Mail Office in Atlanta

    Sorry but this is COMPLETELY and TOTALLY wrong.  Undeliverable means the shipping address doesn't exist as presented...if the address doesn 't exist then they can't deliver it...hence "undeliverable" .  It has nothng to do with seizures.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where do some of you people get this satuff?  It sounds like you are just guessing so the question becomes..... why not talk on topics your are schooled in and refrain from talking about those you know nothing about?  Guesses serve no purpose when facts are -known,

    Or maybe I'm speaking from experience. I was staring at my tracking info saying undeliverable as addressed while a postal inspector on the phone told me a dog alerted to my package.
