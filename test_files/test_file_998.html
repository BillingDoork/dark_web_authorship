    I ordered an ounce of weed from Canada to Scandinavia. I trust the vendors stealth to be very good, based on reviews.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The parcel was sent with express shipping (no sign), and the tracking tells me it was attempted to be delivered but no one was home. (The tracking took well over a week to update) The vendor has contacted the PO and they said it probably did not fit my mailbox. The address has been used to receive multiple international packages in the past, so I am confident that the address is not the problem. I did use a fake name, and the address is not linked to me in any way. I know some people think this is a no-no, but it has worked flawlessly in the past. It is the only way I have been receiving from SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem is that I never would have accepted an order where I would have to pick it up at the PO. I live in Scandinavia, and as far as I know you have to sign whenever you pick up anything from the PO. I have received about 30 shipments unrelated to SR to my real address, and whenever a package has been at the PO i would have had to sign. You also need an ID. But wait, there is more. I am also waiting for a couple of parcels to that same address. From USA and Canada. This is a mess, I know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So this is the situation. Maybe you guys have any clever ideas on how to obtain this parcel "safely"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My ideas so far:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Calling the PO from a payphone or similar claiming to be the "fake person" asking if the parcel is too big to fit in a regular mailbox. If it would fit, maybe I could get lucky and they could attempt another delivery. If it would fit, it would mean that the postman made a mistake. The address is like 5 minutes away from the PO. Maybe I could even try to be a sneaky fucker and ask if the person behind the counter could just drop it off on their spare time. Might be very far fetched, but I guess the worst that could happen is that they would say no.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could say that I just left for vacation, and will not be back in time to pick it up. I could ask if someone else could pick it up for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or I could simply walk in to the PO and ask for the package. Problem is the fake name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thing is that going to the PO is something I told my self I would never do. What if I go pick it up and everything works out. Then a couple of days later, a parcel to the same address gets seized. LE could simply check the camera. The time and date of the pickup is always registered, so this would be super easy to check.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I am really hoping for is that since the parcel was not supposed to be signed for, maybe they would just hand it to me. That seem very unlikely though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This post ended up as a mess haha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, what would YOU do? Any tips or ideas?

    There was no notice in the mailbox. However, there is a notice on the tracking info. A printable one. It has a box where it says "signature"... I think they might leave a notice a long with delivering regular mail tomorrow.
    <br/>
    There is also a "pick up code". The info is limited, found nothing about notices etc.

    I'd cut your losses. Ounce of weed is not worth the charge. I picked up once from a post office but only cause it was for a friend and my honesty and reputation was on the line. Was a huge order too. But IM THERE FOR MY FRIENDS. EVEN IF SOMETIMES SHOT HAPPENS WE MUST DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES.I RISKED A FELONY DRUG CHARGE OVER STATE LINES JUST TO HAVE THIS FRIENDS BACK. I ALWAYS WILL. HOPE THIS PERSON KNOWS THAT

    I gotta agree with the post above, cut the loss man... Or u can always leave a not in the mailbox to the mail women, If she leaves a not saying to pick it up or needs to be signed for, sign the papper and have a re dilverd and just tell them to leave it on your front door step or porch..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My mail lady always leaves packages that are too big, there put on my front porch. They never take them back to the PO but i live in a small town where i know the mail lady and use to date her sister so iv kinda got it made..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or have a friend go get it and offer him some of it or some money..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT DO NOT PRINT THE TRACKING INFO AND SHOW THEM IF THEY DONT LEAVE A NOTE..THATS PROOF YOUR TRACKING AND EXPECTING..  U gotta Wait for That Note bro.. IN THE USA they leave us a Pink slip if it has to be sign for and NO one is Home...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then u can go get it 10 minets before they close or call the next morning and tell them to send it back out with the mail carrier for your street..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get Things from AUSSY land, and a few times she claims she doesnt have the option of no sign that they tell her international packages must be sign for if expressed.. Makes no sense to me,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    shes not a dealer though just a good friend that send me Oc;s the orignals.. But its been times when she sent express and i wasnt here and i just eaither sign the slip and said for redeliver, or call and tell them to bring it back out that day....In your case i dont know how your mail system works soo i m not sure how much of advice to give other than my own

    They're going to ask you for your ID, and likely to sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not necessarily because LE has caught you or something, but to remove liability from the clerk behind the desk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's not particularly realistic that this is the case, but if let's say your next door neighbor was outside when the delivery attempt was made and your mail carrier walked back to their truck with your package in hand then they know your package wasn't delivered and will be at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Without confirming the identity of the person going to pick up a package from the post office, it would be remarkably easy ... if your neighbor was scum for them to just walk into the post office, say they were you, and walk out with your package.  That's why they require you to show them your ID, if they didn't, it would only take this happening once at any post office in your whole country before it got picked up by the media and your Countries postal system would find itself in some pretty deep water, with the media bloating it up with questions questioning 'if it was this easy for person x to just stroll in and steal someone else's mail, how can we know how many times and how frequently this has happened across all of Scandanavia over the years?' ... or any number of crap the newspaper could print questioning your postal system, which could be disastrous to it, requiring a full audit, a complete shakeup of the upper management, or any number of thing's that simply put would create a huge nightmare for mail delivery across all of Scandanavia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They'll require you to sign as internal confirmation that you really did come and get your package and not that a similar situation I described above has occured, this time by the postal worker, who again could just steal your package even though an audit would show that your local mail carrier made a delivery attempt, was unable to and left a notice for you to have to go to the post office and pick it up (as well as a list of all the addresses on your mail carrier's route for which he/she was required to leave a pickup notice and return those packages to your local post office that day).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as i'm aware the requirement for you to show your ID and to sign are both internal policies meant to ensure that a person's mail doesn't just 'go missing'.  It'd also ensure that your mail carrier hasn't been stealing packages, because the post office will have a similar 'list', and especially when the receivee (you) called to ask where your package is and it's not at the post office or on their list, that the mail carrier in that situation is responsible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a side note, ordering from someone who ships to you with the requirement that the package be signed for isn't the death threat wish that really paranoid people around the forum's have managed to convince everyone.  It's usually because the vendor's country simply requires all packages (where package is defined as mail exceeding a specific weight and specific dimensions, vs. lettermail, whose signatory policy may be different) be signed for as a tenet of it's own internal auditing system, or that the vendor want's to ensure he/she has prevented scammer's from doing their thing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Signing for a package really isn't that huge a deal that many keep saying it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, in your situation, i'm sorry to say that you're more then likely boned :(.  You had a good idea in calling and asking that they make another delivery attempt, because even if they require you to sign, they won't require you (USUALLY) to present ID because they know you're the receivee ... or else why are you in that house answering the door.  And you just have to sign it with a signature of some sort that looks nothing at all like your own.  In fact you could in many cases just draw like little stick people or a landscape as your signature lol, cuz most mail carrier's aren't gonna check, they just need it to be done so that liability is removed from them.  I don't recommend you draw stick people though cuz they may very well check it.  But I do recommend you write a signature that looks nothing like your own and looks like one of those whacked out signatures that many ppl have that look so crazy you can't tell their name by their signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they refuse to make another delivery attempt there's really nothing you can do because you used a fake name, and 99 to 1 the post office will ask you for valid photo ID for the post office side of internal auditing and assurance that no mail left that facility without confirmation that it was released to the person to whom it was addressed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sorry for the 'told you so' i'm about to say, but to you and everyone else, never use a fake name, alway's use your real name.  A fake name gives you absolutely no more protection and in fact if you do find yourself in court would give the DA a smoking gun that you intentional attempted to circumvent the postal system to import illegal contraband ... aka the whole plausible deniability defense is out the window, and if you've reached that level of seriousness that you've  been charged and have found yourself defending yourself in court, you have very few defense options, and plausible deniability ("I never ordered any package and have no idea who that person's return address is or what that package is because i've never ordered anything'.  If it's got a fake name on it you can bet the DA will convince the judge that you did order, or were at least aware that the package was coming for you, and that worse yet, you made a premeditated attempt to cover this up ... which will probably end you up with one of the harsher sentences there are if/when you're found guilty).  Plausible deniability is is usually the strongest defense that someone would have because it's a perfectly believable story that some irrate x-gf or friend purposefully sent you illegal contraband to fuck you over.  If you use a fake name though ... why would an x-gf use a fake name if your argument is that they were trying to nail you and it would only seem logical they'd do everything to make sure the package looked like you ordered it.  Plausible deniability in my opinion is probably your strongest defense, because if you don't open it, how can the DA prove you had it sent to you.  If it's got a fake name on it (and you're the only resident at that address), the DA will have compelling evidence against your argument that you have no idea what it is or that you never ordered it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course if there are multiple tenent's at you're address, then using a fake name would be you're STRONGEST defense, but that's only if you're prepared (or had planned from the get go) to throw one of your roomates under the bus and say it was all them and they even told you they were planning it etc.  Sure it'll get you a get out of jail free card, but it'll also put a perfectly innocent person in jail and makes you probably the lowest piece of shit person I can think of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say though that I agree with klaw and you should cut your losses and consider it a lesson learned (and never order anything illegal to that address in the future!).  Then again it also doesn't hurt to call them (from a phone that can't be linked to you in any way of course) and at least request a reship, and even tell them you're giving them authority to leave it on your doorstep (though the laws in each Countries public postal system regarding this are all different.  Some places will take your verbal confirmation as enough, and it's even possible that packages that were shipped with a signature requirement from the vendor that they'll take a verbal confirmation over the phone as your 'signature' as absolutely crazy as that sounds.  It's such a crazy thought that I wouldn't have mentioned it if I haven't myself had computer parts that required a signature left on my door by a simple phone call saying you waive any culpability if it's lost or doesn't arrive.  Crazy cuz if someone ships you something and specifically chooses the option that it requires signature on delivery that social engineering can be such a powerful tool that you can have it left on your door without signing, I know this cuz i've done it buying comp parts from a re-seller who uses one of the private carrier''s like FedEx, and my closest FedEx is really far away and my car broke and ... etc. etc.).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it were me though, I would purposefully take the loss to teach myself a lesson to take care in making sure I do all the right things when ordering (and as far as i'm concerned, using your real name and not a fake one is a must).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whatever you choose to do though, I wish you luck, and hopefully thing's end up just working themselves out for you.

    Don't stress it man, back when I started on SR the same thing happened to me. First of all since you are ordering from Canada that signature thingy is actually standard. Whenever I order anything there is always a slot
    <br/>
    that says signature however the tracking info will determine if there should be a signature or not. However you would know more about your country then I do so it is possible that the post office would require you to sign even if the vendor did not send it with signature required.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now regarding what I did when this happened to me. This has happened about 3 times to me, because the envelope could not fit. Although it was only a half oz the vendor used a stealth that involved a larger package then most vendors use. I had a friend stand by the post office and have  a smoke outside with the delivery card. I walk by pretending to be entering, he has a conversation with me and hands me the card. I go in and pick up the package using the card, and he has signed the part which authorizes me to pick up the parcel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The point of this? If I get caught my story is "This dude told me he would give me 20 bucks to get his mail because he is banned from the building for shoplifting" (our post offices are in pharmaplus and convenience stores usually). Sketchy story? Perhaps, but definitely reasonable doubt. I have done this 3 times, at all times it was no problem at all. I was worried once because in one of the parcels there was only one vacuum seal and the other one was open. I emptied my house, scared shitless, but nothing happened. Thank god... so yea I am almost certain you are fine man.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HOWEVER if it was sent priority (not express, priority is different) it WILL REQUIRE SIGNATURE. If the vendor shipped Priority worldwide with Canadapost it WILL REQUIRE A SIGNATURE if your country has such resources. Also with the tracking taking a week, that is normal. Tracking typically does not update on the receiving country site for 2-3 days after arrival. What I would do is have the vendor check the tracking info to see how long it was in customs. If it was a day or two, I'd say go pick it up and enjoy some nice Canadabud!
    <br/>
    If it was stuck in customs for 5 or 6 days I would probably be a little more worried, but try something else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also your idea of asking them to reship, don't think it would hurt. I mean as long as you don't make it seem desperate, as that may seem a little fishy. Anyways man best of luck. My advice, as a Canadian though, is to go pick it up. Try asking if they could redeliver (I know in Canada purolator would do that but the Canada Post would laugh and hang up). Hopefully they would be willing too and you could sit on your doorstep until they show!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck man, hope this helped!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And as a final word of advice, it is a good idea to ask the vendor what size the package will be. Vendors like to switch it up, keeps things from looking suspicious. Some have very high stealth so that even if customs opened it, it would pass through. So even an ounce, which can potentially fit in a standard 22x17 cm envelope, is in a large envelope or even a medium box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take care!

    I'm not recommending you do this but it has only ever worked for me..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go into the post office with the slip and you should be able to pick it up without ID or signature. If they ask for ID or sig, scan a utility bill, change the name on it to the fake name with the correct address, print that out and you should be sweet.

    Woah, never doing that again haha. You wouldn't believe my ninja plan.  Ended up with a "sort-of" disguise and went to the PO. My thought was that if she needed ID, I would say that I did not bring it and would come back later.. It all went smoothly, no ID required and the weed is absolutely amazing. Stupid risk to take for an ounce, I know but I couldn't help smiling when I arrived home safe and sound.  I will not reveal my super-ninja tricks to be on the safe side here.

    The rule that I follow in these cases is a simple one. I get lots of busines mail, personal mail, etc. If a package doesn't show up and I know it's intercepted I won't ask about the package or admit knowledge of it. If, however, a notice is given then wy wouldn't you pick up the parcel? that seems sketchy to me lol. So if the PO doesnt' inform you of the package, NEVER ask about it.
