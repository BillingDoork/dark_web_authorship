    I'm guessing this is just because it's in-between stages of it's shipping?  I tried using google to figure it out and searching on the forums but it's hard to piece together people's conversations.  It seems to have something to do with switching systems.

    I'm new at this, but I have a package that says this too. Whereas I have another in transit, shipped later, that showed as being processed through a sort facility. So I'm not sure what to make of it. Hopefully someone more experienced will let us know...

    How long has it been? It can take up to a day for USPS to start showing the information, or sometimes longer until they scan it at a sorting center. I've had items scan at every sorting center and some not scan until the show arrival at unit on the day of delivery....USPS is notoriously bad for tracking info.

    On mine, it placed in a drop box last Tuesday and still shows nothing. However one sent a couple days later, same drop box, shows being sorted at the local sort facility. Has me worried about the first package (which was sent domestic priority and still hasn't been received yet).

    Likely you have a DCN and not a tracking number.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It will update very slowly and is only really meant to show delivery confirmation, not station to station movement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get this message all the time on things I buy on eBay that just has DCN's.

    Exactly, its only a DCN. I'll try not to worry and wait a few more days then. Priority just must be running real slowly in my neck of the woods or the receipents. Thanks!

    My last 3 orders with DCN were delivered, then the following day, the site was updated with the packages @sorting facility estimated delivery of the following day. Strange games the government is playing these days.

    I haven't ordered anything with a DCN in months and yesterday I got one from a pretty new vendor with only 4 transactions completed.  The DCN has not updated so I am glad to see it's not just mine.

    It means one of two things..either the item has not yet been scanned into the system or you have entered an incorrect number.  Bottom line is the system does not find that set of digits in its database at that moment.
