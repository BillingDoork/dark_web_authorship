    I ordered a small amount of cannabis and received a letter from the state of origin's Post Master.  The package was confiscated because it was believed to violate federal drug laws.

    <br/>
    My main question is, should I be worried about receiving future packages to the address?

    Yeah, I would just take the safe route for a while and lie low, or use a different address. Obviously they're not gonna come busting down your door for minimal amounts, if that's what it was, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

    Let me lay it all out...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered a 1/2oz listing from a reputable vendor in mid-December.  After about a week of not arriving I received a full refund because the vendor was out of town and couldn't re-ship.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After getting my refund I placed an order with a different vendor and received it within 4 days.  So apparently I have gotten a package since the first was confiscated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the end of January I got a certified letter from the Post Master of the state where the package was shipped.  I can't recall exactly what the letter said but the basics were that the package was being held because it was "suspected" to be in violation of Federal Law.  It said that either the sender or I had 30 days to claim the package or it would be disposed of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @thelorax, I'm not going to divulge the vendor's name because I do not believe that a single intercept should ruin someone's reputation.

    It's a moral imperative that you reveal the vendor's name, for the safety of everyone else, including the vendor if you haven't contacted them about it already. Everyone has the right to know if a vendor has had a package intercepted, and the nature of the incident. If that single interception ruins someone's reputation, well then that's up to the buyers to decide and not for you to decide that the info needs to be suppressed.

    If I were that young I would probably substitute the letter 'u' for the word 'you', type in all caps, and use abbreviations like GTFO on a daily basis.

    The vendor was WestCoastRX.  But I want to emphasise that I was refunded and everything was handled professionally and politely throughout the entire process.
