    Want to order.  I am scared of customs. I know they usually seize small quantities of prescriptions, but I was going to order some K.  Like 1 to 3/5 grams.  I assume they get it flat and do an envelope, which I would think is good?  I just want to know if you would advise this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After a certain vendor was banned I received a love letter for an envelope of valium which all it said and I don't want to be over paranoid.   I mean I get out in a car everyday and that is danger as hell, statistically, not to mention consuming drugs and driving with them....

    So... SR's Finest.  Opinion?

    +1's for all comments, helpful or not.

    I'm sorry..  But I had to chuckle.   ;D ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Getting a gram or a hen of K from the UK to the US isn't a big deal at all.  I got some from Reich a couple weeks back, along with some other things, and it came just fine.

    You should be okay.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I dunno...Fuck customs and the uncertainty. I haven't ordered anything illicit/illegal from out of the country yet, and I doubt that I will. I prefer to deal 100% domestic, even though sometimes it's hard to get what you want and/or the prices are higher than overseas, but to me, it's worth it.

    There are, but I can't find one that will compete in price.  I would place a good sized order, but I will not pay double.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was on another site and just bought a bunch of the 10ml vials and will make the powder myself, but I wish I could get a fair price on it in the US.
