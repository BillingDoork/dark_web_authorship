    I have placed drugs inside the barrel of each of your service weapons and the only way to access them is to look directly into the barrel for them and pull the 'secret' lever disguised as the guns trigger. Make sure the gun is loaded or else the evidence will self destruct.

    Before I use a stealth method I search the internet for stealth methods to make sure I cannot find it. Now there are several others on the internet that I won't use.

    Yeah, less keen on the "Try hiding it in Brand X product specifically!" and more keen on the tips on *types* of internal stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would stick to the principle of no discussion on this topic except that the piss poor quality of internal stealth across much of the Road means that conversations like this need to be had.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the topic - may I suggest a conceptual distinction not yet discussed:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A: camouflaged for the thinking inspector - complete and consistent disguise AND something that someone would conceivably order by mail
    <br/>
    B: camouflaged for the dullard - hidden from view but disguise/package makes NO SENSE if the inspector takes the slightest moment to wonder why someone would send something like this through the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A is, if I didn't telegraph my point too strongly, superior to B. Either is superior to C, which is "no disguise - anyone up for Russian roulette?" But if you're a vendor who's already putting in enough effort to reach B, why not put a little more thought into it and go for A?

    isn't it very dangerous to use foodpackaging ?!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if the vendor is using a real (not his real of course, but a real) return address, the package could be returned to that address. or for whatever reason will get in the hands of a third party.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there is a chance that that food than will be eaten. that could end very very bad. parents might leave it lying around because they dont know what to do with it. kids might eat it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    some courts will rule that as murder. 20 y for ordering an eightball of coke... think again
