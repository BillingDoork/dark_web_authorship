    As a vendor is it important to attach a dcn to every package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ex. A couple grams of weed in a bubble mailer

    without one. Your customer could say "I never got it BRO!" and demand a refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have no way to prove they are lying if you dont have a DCN.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If SR resolution is called in to mediate, they could give them customer the $ back.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have a DCN, proving delivery - then they dont have much of a leg to stand on.

    Delivery Confirmation slips are freely available via any post office. They are the bright green ones.

    <br/>
    I cant speak to any other delivery company, and with good reason, just about every U.S. vendor uses USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is a reason for it, and frankly if you don't know what it is then you are honestly not ready to think about starting a vendor account.

    I wish the buyer could receive the DCN :P

    If I were vending I wouldn't give it to the buyer either.

    I always use and give the buyer DCN. Why? Well I use DCN for peace of mind, and so people tempted to scam don't. I give people their DCN because the fuck am I going to do with it. I am not going to store the number physically written down along with the user name, that is just stupid. I could keep an encrypted copy, but even that feels too nefarious and risky. In the end checking to early/too frequently/on tor is on the buyers end. I always warn buyers to not check for at least 4 days, after that I feel even checking on tor would be of much smaller risk. If you are too impulsive not to do that, then you should not be using drugs.

    I would advise everyone against using DCN forms sequentially. If one of your pkgs got seized and the DCN comes from the pile you grabbed... they can just sit back and wait for the next one in the pile to be scanned in to the system and grab it.....  And the following ones.  It won't take them long to establish a profile on your pkgs and shipping patterns which gives them a huge jump start in unmasking you.

    DCN is not proof of delivery to the intended addressee.  The only thing a completed DCN delivery proves is that the letter carrier portably scanned the bar code into the system as "delivered."  It won't tell you where it was delivered nor to whom it was delivered.
