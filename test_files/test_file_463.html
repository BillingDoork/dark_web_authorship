    hey guys, recently, when browsing the various goodies on silk road, i have noticed that many vendors have stopped shipping to the U.S (where i am from). I feel like this is a recent change, since i did not notice any shipping restrictions on items a few months ago. Does anyone know why this is? Has U.S customs beefed up their security? Do the other vendors hate America? This news is very saddening to me, because i feel all of the best deals are from vendors not shipping over here.

    I haven't really noticed this, but it could be cuz of the holiday season. Maybe they don't want to deal with all their American customers complaining about the delay.

    I know for a fact the majority of NL vendors do not ship to the US or AUS, due to the fact that the Netherlands is a flagged country for customs/post.

    As tempting as it is, I never order from NL due to the extra scrutiny by Customs. Some mail will get through but with NL being a known drug hot-spot worldwide, it's too much of a risk IMO. :)

    Was really suspicious about my order aswell, but it arrived today from there flawlessly. Could be because it was a flat envelope. Obviously a package immediately raises suspicions of weed.
