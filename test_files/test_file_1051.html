    So I'm expecting a package today by noon - when I go to track it this morning (like I've done for every package from this vendor) - it says it's still in the Origin city but it says "Depart USPS Sort Facility" -- usually by 10:30 or 11am it will say Arrive at Local Post Office and Out For Delivery by like 1015am - but none of that showed up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Package never came - still not showing any updates beyond Depart USPS Sort Facility on 5/1
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's the likelihood that I'll actually receive the package?  Anyone else had this situation?  How did it work out?  When did you receive it (or did you receive it?)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    I have had this happen with a legal express mail package before.  The package came the following day but it sure does piss you off when you pay for express shipping and its delivered as if it were a priority package.

    This is when you contact the courier and demand a refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canada post will issue refunds to the sender if the item took longer than the guarantee delivery time.

    Express got worse and worse leading up to the postage increase (and priority DCN changes) and continues to disappoint.  You'll likely receive it tomorrow (a day late and $20 lighter).  USPS simply doesn't have enough manpower to deliver on all of their commitment schedules AND do personal pickups whenever Joe Smoe calls AND watch out for Ricin ... Yeah right, Government employees have never worked that hard!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Disclaimer: USPS Express missed delivery windows repeatedly until I stopped offering it.  Now there's no more Express stress!

    Thanks to everyone's input - helped out a lot.

    i'm going to leave this thread up to maybe help someone in the future going through the same thing.
