    I came to this idea thinking about steroids, but it may be applicable elsewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This may seem like an obvious idea, but  I think it may have substantial power, both for legal reasons and because there are just so many damn drugs out there, and it is far harder to actually test an unidentified substance to determine what it is, than to simply go by the label.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think, in all seriousness, that simply removing the labels from injectable drugs may greatly increase their sucess at getting through customs, and secondly that the risk to the importer may be greatly reduced, justy leaving the vials unlabelled altogether.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Replacing the labels is also pretty easy with an inkjet printer and a few labels of any random non-controlled obscure injectable phamaceuticals that have been scanned in and cleaned up in   photoshop then re-printed on a color printer.  I'm not an expert of course, but it doesn't seem like it would increase the legal hot water you would ever get in, either, so it is a prretty much assured improvement on the safety front, at very little cost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In some ways it may not be as  some stealth packaging approaches I can think of  (concealing the substance inside what appears to be AA batteries for instance), but it  could be a lot better than what I have seen in practice, and very easy to implement, requiring no special equipment, and not requiring re-packaging of the substance (which reduces it's market value).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs probably has to have some basis before they confiscate something.  There may even (I'd hope) be rules against confiscating things that they have no hard reason to suspect are illegal.  Who knows, maybe leaving the vial unlabelled is enough.  If not, having it explicitly labelled an obscure unscheduled pharmaceutical implies they could get in hot water for interfering with someone's legal right to import the drug for personal use or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another thing is that I used to order non-controlled drugs for  a heart problem that I had, and the pharmacy would include an explanation - mostly honest - about what the drug was and so on, and they said that really helped their customs clearance rate.  I even got two packages that were taped shut with customs tape but with the contents untouched.  There is no way they could actually know what chemical substance is in there......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously this exacerbates the threat of counterfeiting, however that is what the pics and unique code would be for.  And there must be some degree of trust of the seller of course, that they don't just use the same pic over and over again selling vials, circumventing the holograms etc often put on vial labels.  That is partly what SR is for; to allow a reputation system so we can track the reputation of the sellers and buyers in the community and thereby gain the trust needed for efficient commerce.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alternatively, you could have the labels shipped separately I guess, by lettermail, which is usually not opened by customs esp if it has no sign of pills or anything in it.

    Hey great, does it work then? Why not use it more if so?? I have never seen it used or any seller offer to use it.
