    I don't have a fake id so does that make them useless?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd prefer to have stuff shipped elsewhere so i was looking into a po box.

    I order very personal amounts to a PO Box. I'd probably lose sleep at night if I was buying large quantities though. Worth it in my opinion.

    If you live with parents or nosey room mates then yeah a PO box isn't a bad idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you get a UPS Mailbox (which is still a PO box) you can make up a fake business name and have items shipped to that business name, thus your name never appears on the package itself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you were ever thinking of using a fake ID to obtain a PO box, stop now.  That's a whole new level of FUCK if you are caught.

    Think about getting a fake ID with a PO box registered to that fake ID.  why have it traced to you? do some recon before you grab your package...

    Buying large quantities of stuff? lbs+? Get a 24/7 P.O. box with a fake ID and pick up your packages a week after they come. Even then it's risky, you could always hire someone to pick it up for you but you don't know if they'll just run off with the package or squeal on you. Then you risk getting caught receiving drugs to a P.O. box registered under fake credentials which just escalates the case to an instant felony and even more interest to investigate you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    tl;dr Only get a P.O. box if you absolutely need one and even then open it with your real information.

    Good advice.  It is better to use your real info because if you get caught getting a package you are already fucked by using a fake identity.

    Well i guess they both have there plus and con's. I'm not really trying to get bulk amounts of product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just personal/small time dealing basically enough to dose my self for free. I just rather not have a ton of packages sent to my house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Being that i've gotten mix reviews about both options what would be the best choice for me? And if i went the fake id route where would people recommended picking one up. I've heard mix reviews about kings of ace.

    Send it to your house and start buying everything online. I know people that get packages online cause they buy everything online like on amazon/ebay. It's not weird to get packages everyday, just how it's not weird dropping off packages everyday. No one really cares about you if you're a buyer unless you're buying in bulk or just give them a reason to care about you. Remember everything the government does costs money, money they really can't spent right now.

    I dont see the problem with using fake ID and fake documents to open a PO Box, youd be surprised at how easy it actually is, as holly said do some recon or wait a week before getting your stuff, try to find UPS stores that will be very hard for them to raid and dont park directly in front of that store,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anything were to happen to the package in transit Id rather have them trying to guess who I am with fake information than have my actual info, either way if they find drugs in bulk your fucked so why not have it in a name that isnt yours? if they find a huge package just move simple as that,
