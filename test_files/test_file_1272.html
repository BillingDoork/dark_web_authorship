    Hey all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So about 2 weeks ago a package came through from an African country. The stealth was pretty terrible and it arrived with a yellow customs sticker on it, but with all the contents still inside (pain meds).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since then I've had one next day domestic delivery, but the rest haven't arrived, historically it's been 100% next day. This is from 2 different vendors as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Advice on what to do next?
    <br/>
    Cheers

    So.. you have waited one day for 2 domestic express deliveries? Then have come to a conclusion that something is up?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this is the case can you wait another 5 days and report back here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Only because historically there's a 93% next-day success rate for domestic deliveries and all other next-day domestic letters /post arrived today, but I will report back, thanks.

    Don't stress. I have had domestic express postage show up 7 days later where historically it was 2 days for me to this particular drop.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even though tracking said it had been delivered it still wasn't there.. until 3 days later.
    <br/>

    Sometimes shit happens with the postal system outside of anyone's control and I'm confident you will be replying back here likely within the next 48 hours with the success of the domestic orders. (Have you also used these domestic vendors before and know that they actually do send it when they hit that 'in transit' button, sometimes if you haven't used a particular vendor before they may have different methods than others).

    ABC, I want to give you karma but haven't figured that shizzle out yet.
    <br/>
    Thanks dude/dudette for the quick response. Yeah, it was from a very trusted vendor. Weirdly they both arrived about 5 minutes ago but I didn't see who delivered them, wasn't with the normal post.
    <br/>
    Bit odd, but have informed vendor. Thanks for putting my mind at ease. Have an awesome weekend.
    <br/>
    Oh, and having been to Iceland (and loving it), I agree, it rocksÂ  ;D

    Once again, lay off the drugs and be patient.
