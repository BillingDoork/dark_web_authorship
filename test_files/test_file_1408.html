    I think that would be a little hard to tell. I think you'd have to look at each vendor's listings and see what country they ship from. If they all ship from the USA for example then it's quite likely the vendor is in the USA. (But not guaranteed, the vendor may be using drop shipping). Some listings don't show the country it is shipping from either.

    This is the kind of data StExo could probably extract from his crawling of the SR listings (maybe depending on how much it is worth to you).

    i'm wondering because in one of the reports on the recent bust in germany they knew exactly how many people were sellers from silkroad. or something like that i dont quite remember maybe it was from Austrailia. They were around 47 dealers and it was in the news report.

    Click the header and there's a compiled list of how many listings there were for each country 15 days ago.  Unfortunately counting vendors is much harder, since with listings it's as easy as setting your home country and enabling domestic.  Your best bet would be either manually checking all the vendors who have domestic listings, or using fancy code to trawl through.  StExo has automated a similar process, but it clearly took some time.

     So, I have went through the monumental effort (those working closely with me know exactly how long this took to get started) of putting together a new hidden service, featuring the saved HTML page of each vendors page.

    One problem is that vendors sometimes operate shipping out of multiple countries, and therefore are neither here nor there.
