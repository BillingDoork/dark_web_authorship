    The middle sentence in bold says : "A sharp increase in smuggling through mail packages"   - seems like they catch a lot  &gt;:( &gt;:(

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors, Do you recognize any of your goodies?
    <br/>
    If so, better to improve your stealth, or at least, avoid sending to IsraHell.

    If you look at the majority of those photos, The stealth was not really up to par. Look at the (weed?) it is not even vacuumed, the bag has loads of air in it. The material looks really flimsy, and I dont think it was secured properly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All customs love to show packages they manage to intercept.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dont think there is anything too much to worry about, However israeli customs are somewhat tougher than other countries, In my opinion they are up there with Aus and NZ.

    First off I would expect Israel to be one of the toughest on mail inspection goes. They're under constant threat from dirty muslims 24/7. - I'd open EVERY piece of mail if I were them!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second - I doubt any of this concerns Silk Road. -When's the last time you saw the question "Anyone ship to Israel?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Third - Don't believe everything, no ANYTHING, you see on TV. - There's no way to prove facts. There are more ways to fake facts.
    <br/>
    Take US Puppet Prez speech last night. At one point he explains since we have proof Syria used chem weapons, America cannot stand by and let that happen. Later, in the same speech he says "America is not the worlds policemen" - Well? Which is it Mr Prez?  Also where's the "proof" Syria used chem weapons? That BS video?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's all scripted bullshit. That show was more likely put on TV to make the mongrels trying to kill their people, think twice before mailing anything that explodes!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really hope Obama doesn't get us involved w/Syria. Though it looks he will. The puppet masters seem to be pulling his strings to make it so.

    God Bless my Jewish friends during this time of spirituality and introspection.  Happy New Year.

    You're right my friend, most of the drugs actually smuggled from the borders. They know that it's an endless cat &amp; mouse chase but as long as they are getting paid for it they'll keep doing their job.

    I didn't say that all of these drugs are from SR although it's likely to be. There are some Israeli customers around here but not many.
    <br/>
    In addition, I always here about Israelis that get caught because of drug orders so these pics in fact, just confirm all those rumors.

    About Syria, I'm the one who should worry that my neighbors won't shoot chemical gasses on me...

    Like being said before me, those looks REALLY bad on packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    besides - people in Israel like to get lots of credit while not doing anything really. There was a story of a kiosk in a big city in center Israel that used silkroad to sell stuff for over a year(!) - the police bragged about catching the guy after a very long and complicated digital operation... The truth was one of his partners snitched him off... :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also - as long as someone order low quantities for self use and not going to deal - I think everything will be ok.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    +1 for everyone for jewish brotherhood. ^-^

    Here is the interview which took place on the 15/8 on the Israeli morning talk show with Avri gilad and the head of custom
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For those who don't understand the language the head of custom talks about different things that get intercepted by the Israeli custom including many smart phones and fake brands, He talks about the clear net cannabis seeds purchases that is on a major increase and have been caught many times, But the must popular drug who gets intercepted by Israeli custom according to hes words is Ya ba, which is tablet that contain a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine which is originated from places like Burma Laos and China so any package from these regions will be carefully looked on , the drug is mainly consumed by foreign workers who use different method than we do on Silkroad.. Hence the elephant and the poor packaging displayed on the images! Besides that hes not revealing anything about their strategies and clearly states that he is "determent to fight this phenomena".

    Yes, there are a bunch of us here :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm fairly new on SR, but I have already received something like 4 orders, only weed so far and small quantities (largest was 5g).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I gotta say, this thing worries me though. Because I have been waiting for another 3 orders to arrive for almost one month!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With all the holidays, they could just be very delayed. Ive had regular mail from Europe arrive after 3-4 weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does any of the Israelis know what happens when customs intercepts a letter with drugs (assuming quantities for personal consumption)?

     Like being said before me, those looks REALLY bad on packaging.

     <br/>
     besides - people in Israel like to get lots of credit while not doing anything really. There was a story of a kiosk in a big city in center Israel that used silkroad to sell stuff for over a year(!) - the police bragged about catching the guy after a very long and complicated digital operation... The truth was one of his partners snitched him off... :P
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also - as long as someone order low quantities for self use and not going to deal - I think everything will be ok.

    You're right 100% - we should keep small orders and few orders, if we place too many orders our customs might track down on us.

    BTW, where did you hear about that kiosk?

     Here is the interview which took place on the 15/8 on the Israeli morning talk show with Avri gilad and the head of custom
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For those who don't understand the language the head of custom talks about different things that get intercepted by the Israeli custom including many smart phones and fake brands, He talks about the clear net cannabis seeds purchases that is on a major increase and have been caught many times, But the must popular drug who gets intercepted by Israeli custom according to hes words is Ya ba, which is tablet that contain a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine which is originated from places like Burma Laos and China so any package from these regions will be carefully looked on , the drug is mainly consumed by foreign workers who use different method than we do on Silkroad.. Hence the elephant and the poor packaging displayed on the images! Besides that hes not revealing anything about their strategies and clearly states that he is "determent to fight this phenomena".

    leking, stop ordering weed, I'm telling you as I care about any Israeli around here and I don't want any more people to get caught. Our customs own a lot of sniffing dogs that easily smell the wonderful odor of the weed. It's too risky.
    <br/>
    About your question: personally, I don't know what happens but I can assume that when our customs intercepts a drug package, they mark your address in the "black list" and wait until they get another package to this address - if they intercept another drug package - then, they got their proof and go with all the evidences to inform the police.

    First of all, thanks for your concern :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thing is I only order from vendors who use moisture barrier bags and there is absolutely no smell. Unlike vacuum sealing, where we don't smell anything but dogs can smell it. But you're not the only one to warn me. I thought it would be similar to the US, where for small orders customs would just send you a letter or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if Israeli police/customs is even tough with small orders, I'll go back to buying from the "street". Unfortunately all my connections offer only shitty weed for high prices... That's what I love about SR so much. Huge selection &amp; good quality.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So which goods are "safe" to order from SR?

       I know people who have had more than a dozen seizures and still receive bulk internationally and domestic so I am not sure where you are getting your information from...  Do you know how many thousand packages are found with narcotics in them every Monday through Saturday?  That blacklist would have to be millions of people and if you are talking about the USA then forget about it because the USPS is broke.

    Although customs aren't geniuses, we shouldn't decry their work. My logic say that since every address has it's own zip code and every package/letter is being sorted by human hands (no robots), then they must scan every package zip code into a computer and if the computer recognize a zip code which in the "black list" it will warn the workers immediately for further inspection of the package. At least, That's what I would've done if I was the customs Chief officer, and I'm sure the customs in my country do it.

    Goodies sent by mail and being intercepted by customs it's not a new thing. What's new is SR. So some of this news is kind of propaganda.

     First off I would expect Israel to be one of the toughest on mail inspection goes. They're under constant threat from dirty muslims 24/7. - I'd open EVERY piece of mail if I were them!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Second - I doubt any of this concerns Silk Road. -When's the last time you saw the question "Anyone ship to Israel?"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Third - Don't believe everything, no ANYTHING, you see on TV. - There's no way to prove facts. There are more ways to fake facts.
     <br/>
     Take US Puppet Prez speech last night. At one point he explains since we have proof Syria used chem weapons, America cannot stand by and let that happen. Later, in the same speech he says "America is not the worlds policemen" - Well? Which is it Mr Prez?  Also where's the "proof" Syria used chem weapons? That BS video?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's all scripted bullshit. That show was more likely put on TV to make the mongrels trying to kill their people, think twice before mailing anything that explodes!

     I really hope Obama doesn't get us involved w/Syria. Though it looks he will. The puppet masters seem to be pulling his strings to make it so.

     God Bless my Jewish friends during this time of spirituality and introspection.  Happy New Year.

    You're right. people smuggle drugs for years, since they became illegal. However, with the gaining popularity of SR, authorities became aware to the phenomenon of internet drugs orders and they prepare their customs agencies to work harder as well as to scare the public in TV so they won't do it.
