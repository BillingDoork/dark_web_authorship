    I just received a Flat Rate USPS Priority mail envelope, but I notice it doesn't have any cancellation marks on it.  The postage is one of those "Arlington Green Bridge" stamps but it is actually printed on the envelope (not a stamp).  Besides the address labels, the only sticker is a USPS Tracking# sticker.  Is this legit?  I realize I'm probably being overly paranoid but this seems like a new procedure.  Anyone have any insight?

    Check the tracking# online if nothing shows up it may be a Controlled Delivery, in which case either remove it from the premises or don't open it and write return to sender. Sometimes the USPS misses to put a cancellation mark on the stamp by error, it happened to me a few times.

    block up all entrances and windows... cut firing slits out just above the foundation.... cut out the first story floor behind the firing slits.... if you start to lose the upper hand.... rig the house with dynamite and use your escape tunnel before it blows.... put on your snow shoes and run to cross the mountains where the border is.... if you meet anyone along the way sleep with one eye open and don't flash your gold teeth

    I checked the # and it looks normal.

    resalesam, hah yeah I feel a little silly asking but it really is strange.  No cancellation mark?
    <br/>

    Besides an error USPS my only theory is that these particular envelopes (the ones with the stamp actually printed on) are only available at the counter and must be prepaid.

    I should add that there is no postmark on it at all either.. just the USPS tracking # which does check out at least.  How unusual is this?

    Don't worry about it? Perhaps it was a pre-paid flat rate envelope?
