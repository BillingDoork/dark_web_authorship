    I placed an order for an item from eastern europe that i have had shipped successfully many times in the past. The item is coming into the US. The carrier this time was US Express International, and not EMS which was always the case before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway, i checked the tracking and it says inbound into customs since a week ago. is that normal? io have never had an item delayed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks

    shit, thats not a good sign, if they keep it for a long while it will probably be a Controlled Delivery, if i were you (maybe im just paranoid) i would bury any and all illegal items outside in the mud in bags and wait for the cops to come, then when they bring the package accept it like normal, they may raid you and search your house, when they find nothing you can say you dont even do drugs or any bad stuff and may just get off the hook,

    It's impossible to say given the debt USPS is in right now, I've had a package of multiple kilos of Schedule I substance sit for more than 18 days in Customs and then outbound scan and the package was kosher, but take extra precautions.

    I have a quarter key of methylone that's been sitting in customs for 10+ days as of today... I was assured they don't do CD's on amounts as low as 250g for M1, but I don't feel too confident about that. Hopefully all goes well and usps just sucks because they're poor...

    Personally I have had some semi heavy 150g+ and very shitty (stealth wise) packs Schedule 2 and 3 sit in customs for 14 or more days. usually my rule of thumb is if its been 18-20 days didnt move, it's not going to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have only lost 2 packs and a letter both time for around 150g's each.  Of course this was about 4 years ago and things change over time. I now keep things in the range of 50 grams and feel pretty confident and safe as long as you dont continue to order to the same address with packs gettng snagged.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for sitting in customs for a while then moving again. IMO I think that is safer than it ziping through in 2-3 days here is my logic (which does have holes in it)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a pack sits in customs for a long time usually it because its backed up they are rushing to get things through so the chances of your shit getting searched heavily is low.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the pack is in customs in 24-48 In and out feel pretty good about this too they are feeling lazy your pack got through under the radar etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a pack is there for 4-5 days and comes through you could still be good but I feel like this is this highest chance of CD (if your ordering something like 1/2 or full kilo) since they got it in day 1 searched it day 2 or 3 saw what it was organized a task force for CD day 4 and push the pack out day 5 watching its every move.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now this may make no sense and I really have no evidence to support this other than a close friend of mind got a CD 6-7 years ago for a few thousand pain pills and some other things. &amp; thats how it went down he had no idea he was getting a CD it was just like an old day.   He later found out that one of his partners got busted and flipped on him giving authorities the tracking number (shared email)  of the package thus this pack was targeted from the start over seas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way keep you nose clean your house cleaner and and keep your shit just that YOUR SHIT never know whos ganna flip on you

    It really depends on a number of factors.  I wouldn't worry about it too much.  I've had packs in customs for much longer.

    If you're interested in a source for M1 I could dig around and see if I've still got the contact info for a reputable source out of china.  I'm not going to make guarantees about their stealth as I haven't ordered for a while, but if they're still operating I'll sell their contact info for a reasonable price.  They undercut Jack by enough of a margin.  Hell, maybe it's Jack's source.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, from everything I've heard, Jack seems to be the most knowledgeable and willing to offer wisdom in the field.  Not only that, but from his forum posts he seems to be well read and able to communicate clearly and with a level head.  I suppose it depends on what your priorities are.  If you want a dirt cheap product, a direct source is the way to go.  If you want escrow and a knowledgeable or friendly vendor with which to correspond and discuss potential problems(which I've never had), a vendor here on the silk road is your best bet.

    I watched a lot of documentaries and newspaper articles about custom controls etc.
    <br/>
    If they found a huge amount of drugs they always tried to get the stuff to the reciver as fast as possible for a CD. There have been one or two cases in Europe where they even send a police officer with the drugs by plane trying not to raise any suspicion about the shipping time.
    <br/>
    Maybe one week in customs is more a sign of getting a love letter or a search warrant for your home without a controlled delivery, just guessing.
    <br/>
    It is certain that they are aware of raising suspicion by holding back a delivery for that long.

     It really depends on a number of factors.  I wouldn't worry about it too much.  I've had packs in customs for much longer.

    I have direct access to Chinese sources and would still prefer to work with Jack any day.

    There ya go.  Like I said, there are pro's and con's and each person is going to have to decide what means the most to them.  Personally, I don't see the point in paying nearly twice as much for product, even if the vendor has great customer service.  If you've got your shit down, you can get the same results without the increased price.  However, if you don't, or you want the insurance/escrow/support, then a reputable vendor is an extremely viable option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another option I thought I should mention is having either Jack or one of his competitors TigerRush reship it for you.  The cost will be significantly more than direct source, and even more than ordering straight from china through either of these fine vendors, but you'll have the benefit of having it reshipped directly from the country.  At that point, stealth is rather moot.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suppose this would be a good point to mention that obviously my source doesn't only ship M1, but also a plethora of other RC's.  Many of which I'd assume have been passed of as 'mephedrone' when resold on the road.  I'd like to make clear that I don't condone such deceit, but rather want to say that if a person is paying an arm and a leg for 'meph' but could get the same product for cents on the dollar direct from china, that this might be a better option.  For a complete list of products shipped from this source message me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, before I go to far without verifying that their still in business and then have to retroactively put my foot in my mouth, I'm going to desist with commenting on this publicly without first verifying the current status of such source.
