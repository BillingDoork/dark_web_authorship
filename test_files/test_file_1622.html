    After a few months of reading the forums and trying my own tests with APC's and online postage this is what ive found:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Order label 400's online and have them shipped to a drop that can be linked to you, and if one gets confiscated risk them flagging the whole roll as well as your drop.
    <br/>
    2. Use clicknship with gift cards and have all your customers and packages be stored and linked.
    <br/>
    3. Use APC's with giftcards and go through a painful one-at-a-time label generation process while dealing with cameras and having your packages linked.
    <br/>
    4. Order label 400's and put one on an empty envelope addressed to your customers town and drop it along side the order, then use that to manipulate the admins in the event of a dispute.
    <br/>
    5. Do without tracking and have a no-refunds policy. Buyers will have to accept the risks of the system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems like #4 completely negates the purpose of tracking as it no longer serves as proof that the seller sent the order. I dont know, maybe its time to give up tracking :( :( :(

    I don't see what is wrong with #2 - every name on every envelope is going to get scanned and stored.  This is well known, and is hardly a reason to avoid online shipping options.  As for linking names together - don't use the same gift card for more then an order or two at most.

    True but its a toss up between pissing off some of your buyers by using e-postage and pissing off some of your buyers by not offering refunds. Gift cards come at $25 minimum with a $4 card cost, labels usually only cost $6, thats quite a lot of money lost to anonymity.

    As has been said many times before, buy big stamps and ask for tracking stickers nicely at post offices until you get some. Tell them you want to mail small light flat rate boxes when the USPS is not open/don't want to wait in line/want to use the drive through/don't have a car and want to be able to mail from your home box/....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They may only give you a dozen or so but that has advantages. If you need a lot, have others help you buy postage and ask for them also.

    I tried this a month ago and it worked. Tried again today to get some label 400's and NONE of the 3 places would come off them. One nice fellow even showed me the new instructions their office had received and what it said about label 400's. They are to be kept behind the counter only. He said they had received the paper last week.

    Was that just the priority stamps or any denomination above a certain dollar amount? Using $2 stamps isnt such a big deal.

    Its neither safe nor anonymous for vendors to be giving out their addresses. All it would take is for a cop to sell these and they could track vendors packages too.

    This does not worry me. The Priority stamps they have now have the wrong amount for the new postage prices anyway. There are $2, $5, and $1, $0.20 and $0.86 and a lot of other stamp choices. I have gotten away from "Medium" Priority "flat rate" boxes and any Priority under a Pound are $6.95 or less so $7 postage works pretty well anywhere domestic. I think "Small" Flat rate is $5.80 and I use them, but would be no big deal to do those without a $5.60 stamp.
