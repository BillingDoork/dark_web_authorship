    I was wondering if it would be safe to order from vendor, but use hotel address i'm gonna be in for a couple nights. If domestic is okay, would express be pushing it.

    Never had experience shipping to a hotel. It sounds kind of sketchy, would rather send to a residential address.

    Damn i never heard of anyone trying that either. They may deliver it to the front office i would guess you mean and you would have to tell the people there you're expecting it. Way too sketchy for my taste. I had stuff delivered to my mom and dads once and that even freaked me out. I spent all day doing yard work for them without them asking just so i could receive the package. LOL was funny too because them knowing my past love of weed and they grilled me about it when they saw me grabbing the mail.

    I've had SR packages sent to hotels twice with no problems at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just make sure you contact the hotel beforehand and let them know you are expecting mail during your stay.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing beats arriving at your hotel on the first day of your holiday and being presented with your room key and a big packet of drugs by a smiling receptionist :)

    It has defiantly been done before. A good idea if you are traveling in Europe I think. I know a guy on the forums ordered two things to his hotel in Japan (N-bomes and MD if my memory is right) and they both made it, to his and my relief. I wouldn't book a hotel in your own city for the pure intent of ordering drugs, but that's just me.  :-X

    I just have to spread the gospel....it works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Had two sent to where i stayed (timed it so they arrived on separate days of course). The hotel staff were even nice enough to put the letter under the door while there was a do not disturb sign hanging on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck  ;)

    Personally wouldn't risk it for anything illegal or valuable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It really depends on the hotel. It would probably be a good idea to talk to the front desk staff in person about receiving "a few urgent items off ebay" in advance, which might be difficult to impossible since you're only going to be there a couple days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had dozens of legal/grey area packages sent to me while staying in two different monthly motels. One mom and pop, one a chain. All went smoothly, except one package that got damaged and was spewing what the staff referred to as "sand" all over the place (poppy seeds from inside pods that broke during shipping).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's always general delivery if it's a small town, but that has it's own level of sketch. This involves calling the post office and tell them you'll be in town camping / fishing / some plausible activity people would travel there to do. The mail goes to the PO and you show ID to pick it up. Address as follows: Dick Weiner
    <br/>
    General Delivery
    <br/>
    Anytown, TX 12345
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So many things can go wrong with either of these options. Item could get lost and leave you in a strange town indefinitely to receive a trivial amount of drugs so the wrong person doesn't receive. Hotel staff could return to sender.
