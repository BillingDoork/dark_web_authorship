    So this is the first time where I've had more than 2 orders shipped and on their way from multiple vendors in multiple places, and I have a 4th on the way soon. Should I be more cautious? Refrain from having so many orders at once and spread them out next time? The last time I've had a package come was actually several months ago and I've only ever had 1 missing package, probably due to being lost somewhere along the way. Didn't think about this beforehand but would just like some information from the really frequent roadies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    +1 to anyone who provides good info. Thanks!

    You should def. calm down a bit there jmoney113, you are sending way too much packages at once, atleast have them spread out on different adresses :-) Just what I think about it, I usually ship to myself 1 a month but I order bulk.

    Yeah I got ahead of myself a little there. Two of those packages are coming in as envelopes by super stealth vendors, but I will definitely be wary when checking the mail. Thanks for the tip.

    It's all relative. I don't think about it at all myself because I'm always receiving mail from everywhere.

    What you don't want is to have two orders of the same thing coming from the same country, seen quite a few topics with that happening. You don't know which product is which, or which arrived or not.

    I don't think it's as big of a deal as people make it out to be, that being said I wouldn't want 4 shipments coming in from different parts of the world. If it's domestic I don't see the problem. Many people have tons of orders coming in each week; it is not suspicious in the least to have a few packages come in a week especially if the stealth is good.

    I would order 3-4 stuff from SR and they would all come one by one.  Or even couple at once.  It wasn't sketchy at all considering I live in a rich ass town lol.  Obviously I don't do it anymore.

    I've heard of people having like 10+ at once. I wouldn't worry unless the stealth is poor, or they are all from over-seas.

    If they are domestic, just think of all the ebay/amazon shit people buy now a days, 3/4 packages a week isn't very suspicious/un-common in a lot of homes.

    I think the most caution should be exercised when ordering international and from vendors that are new (to you). Also the products with a smell are of course higher risk.

    There's a lot of variables but I think in general people are more paranoid than anything. Not that that's a bad thing, safety first.  The packages I've ever received at once was five, along with regular mail, junk, bills, etc. Two of those were large envelopes and three were small boxes. I didn't plan it like that, one was late, one super fast, and the other three just coincidence. I get packages almost daily whether it be legal or not. I really don't think the mailman gives a shit either way.
    <br/>
    Remember, it's not illegal to have mail delivered to your house and to most carriers it's not their job to detect drugs anyway.  It's insane to think that they monitor mail patterns of each address when they deliver to so many.  Like I said, I really think people get way too paranoid about this.  If you were going to get caught I seriously doubt it would be because of the mail carrier. I would think LE or someone else, like a postal inspector, would be the one to raise the flag. By all means, be careful in what you do, but don't let paranoia get in the way of your freedom.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just wanted to edit to clarify I'm talking about domestic packages. International is a whole different thing. I would definitely handle those shipments differently.

    I agree with the others here. I think you will be fine with your orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the packages are coming from reputable domestic vendors who prioritize stealth shipping you should have nothing to worry about, especially if you are just ordering personal amounts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have Amazon Prime myself, and for those of you who don't have it, it is fucking addictive! I order so much stupid shit on there lol so I am constantly getting packages. There are also packages for other people in my household getting delivered daily.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would just be careful as always when ordering from here as it is not legal! Don't order 4 different packages that each contain a couple of pounds coming from different countries. That would surely be a poor choice!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You understand what I mean. It is all circumstantial but be safe either way!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck!

    Well look, if you normally get legit packages, a number of illicit ones shouldn't make a difference, if they're stealthy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's the problem - if you're faced with a screw up (nonexistent stealth, torn package, address and/or name errors) and it gets one of your special packages opened, you'd better hope it's the last one, because the p.o. may set aside others inbound to you for inspection. And sure, while you have the same ability to deny one package as a half dozen, the "Gosh, I don't know who's sending me drugs" excuse sounds less and less believable (from a starting position of only maybe just) when the value of the incoming drugs goes up and up and up. Yeah, maybe some old buddy decided to send you an 1/8 in the mail, sure. But *also* some pills, and some shrooms, and some crystal? Unasked for, unordered? Uh-huh.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's your stress level. But this seems to me an avoidable risk. What's the rush?

    Best to use a few different addresses if possible. I buy loads of legit stuff online so always have packages arriving. People get packages all the time, as long as they're stealthy then it shouldn't be an issue. It can be quite nerve racking though.

    The best advice is to use common sense.

    A couple of domestic packages at the same time shouldnt be a problem.
    <br/>
    3 or more packages from the Netherlands all arriving in the same day or even same week to a house that doesnt get alot of packages can be kinda sketchy

     Here's the problem - if you're faced with a screw up (nonexistent stealth, torn package, address and/or name errors) and it gets one of your special packages opened, you'd better hope it's the last one, because the p.o. may set aside others inbound to you for inspection.

    This is a good point.  I never considered being mindful of how many packages I had in transit at the same time, but this could justify some degree of paranoia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also recommend cultivating an Amazon and/or eBay habit along with the habits related to SR.  Hide in plain sight.
