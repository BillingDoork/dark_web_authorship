    Hey there. I'm new to all this. I read the official Buyer's Guide, so as to avoid having to ask too many noobish questions, however, that fate seems inescapable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Firstly, it recommends not to send anything to your home address, but to another location like a friend's house or P.O. box. Right now, my only two options are to ship my orders to my college mailbox, or a P.O. box (private mailbox is ridiculously expensive, I'd go broke). If the post office discovers illegals, the consequences would be much worse than being kicked out of school, would they not? The college mailbox seems preferable here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly, it recommends using a fake name. I imagine that A) this would make my package way more suspicious, and B) I would risk my mail being returned instead of properly sorted by either my college mail department, or the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically, both of these "rules" for safe shipping make no sense to me, and I'm wondering what your recommendations are for my particular situation?

    Everyone has different opinions on this and it basically comes down to whatever option you're most comfortable with. Go with whatever option you feel safe with and aren't going to be freaking out/losing sleep over. In my situation I just use my regular address and name, that way I know as long as the vendor ships my item I will be receiving it....I just always make sure to encrypt my address when placing an order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When it comes to what name to use...a lot of vendors recommend that you use your real name because if you don't then there's a chance you won't receive your item....and there's plenty of threads already on here with buyers complaining because their item wasn't delivered due to them using a fake name or a past tenants name.
