    I apologize in advance if this has been covered, but my search results did not adequately answer the questions I have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been expecting a small  Domestic SR order, but nothing else USPS.
    <br/>
    My mailbox is Large.
    <br/>
    I got a "We Missed You" pink slip today that says a signature is NOT required for a LETTER.
    <br/>
    Large volume Vendor with excellent stats did not indicate shipping type, but as no signature is required, I assume Priority.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this something to worry about in anyone's opinion?  I have received over 20 shipments with no problems or pink slips thus far, and from what I have read here, these pink slips are not usually worrisome unless an International package or letter is expected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for any input...I really appreciate it.

    OK, so I went to pick up whatever the pink slip was for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package had postage due of .33 cents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem is that when I looked at the package outside the post office, (after paying the postage due but NO signature),
    <br/>
    the four first class stamps were all postmarked from MY town and not from the town of the return address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, the date of the postmark was yesterday, the same day I got the pink slip.  Today is one week from when I placed the order from a high volume seller whose customers rave about their fast shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package was not opened, and the order was intact, however, the same date postmark from my town that is about 100 miles away from the return address has me kind of worried.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas????

    I suspect you are fine.  The return address doesn't mean anything.  If you want, store everything offsite with a friend for a week.  Ideally, I would have left it unopened/untouched for a while - I do this with all deliveries so I can claim ignorance or write RTS if someone comes looking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or you could privately write to the vendor asking him to verify his packaging - I've never done this, but I don't see why they would object.  Like "Hey do you send USPS in plain, brown envelopes" or something.  Don't ask for his trade secrets.

    I've noticed that packages with stamps often arrive with the stamps uncancelled, probably because they do not go through the cancelling machines as letters do. But this package came to the attention of the post office in your town because of the postage due, and they perhaps saw the uncancelled stamps and just went ahead and cancelled them as a matter of procedure, of course using the cancelling device with the name of your town on it. I would be inclined to say that if you have your order in your hands and you're not in jail, the time for worrying is over. If something was going to happen, it would have happened by now.
