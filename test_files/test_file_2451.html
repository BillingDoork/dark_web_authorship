    Hi, i'm planning on buying 10 acid hits from nipplesuckcanuck (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/index.php/silkroad/item/7370108578) and maybe some other items too. I was doing a little research on buying bitcoins and came to a conclusion that the only way for me to buy bitcoins is via western union. so i was wondering, can someone who is experienced with paying for bitcoins through western union direct me to somewhere legit where i can buy cheap bitcoins? i tried to find something like this on my own, but all i found were shady websites that charge way above mtgox price and sellers on this site that i wasn't sure how to tell if they were legit or not.
    <br/>
    also, i'm familiar with this site for a little under a year but i have never really bought anything with bitcoins, so be patient with me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thnaks :)

    BTCmaster has a bunch of successful transactions and 100% positive reputation as well. Find him/her here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/7bdda04d8b
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never done the Western Union thing so can't give any advice from personal experience, but Sugarmama is definitely well known and from the reviews on BTCmaster's profile... looks decent too. Hope it helps.
