    So I'm relatively computer illiterate and a vendor (etizolam) wants me to send him photo verification of my address. How would I go about doing that?

    Encrypt the photo file (you _are_ encrypting on this site, right?) and send it just as you would any other message.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using gpg on the command line that would be:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    gpg --armor --recipient RecipientsName --output encryptedJpg.gpg --encrypt photo.jpg
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then copy paste what's in encryptedJpg.gpg into the box and hit send.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The person on the other end decrypts it to a .jpg file and opens it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll want to get rid of the photo's EXIF data, too, just in case. Google it, there's services online that'll do it for you and you might already have software that'll do it.

    So how do I copy and paste what's in the encrypted picture without decrypting it? Do I open the document with a textedit/word and then just copy and paste the material inside that?

    I ordered 100mg of DMT freebase along with the pipe. I can't understand any reason why he would do that either.

    WTF? a photo verification of your address? what do u mean?

    however, easiest way to send a photo would be to upload it with the onion uploader and send the url

    He requires anyone purchasing from him for the first time to do it. I guess he wants to distinguish between legitimate buyers and the feds. It's not like the DEA can't feign documents though, so that doesn't make any sense.

    yep, what ^they said.  Go with a different vendor.
    <br/>

    I think etizolam is trying to make sure people are using their real names to avoid bounced packages.  But still, it's not a reasonable request.  Pretty sure there's lots of DMT vendors.

    ONE last question: Do I get a full refund if I cancel the order?

    <br/>
    EDIT: It's still 'processing' after about three days. I can cancel it in 21 hours. You can imagine people have been complaining about how slow this vendor is. Just throwing that info in there.

    tell the vendor to cancel your order because you dont agree with his terms. if HE cancels it you dont haveto pay a cancelation fee. if you cancel it you do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if he wont cancel it for you. name and shame.

    He never reads yet alone replies to his messages. By the way, what's the cancellation fee? I hear it's something like a 90% refund?
