    hello i am a retired mailman in the unitted states. when ordering PLEASE use your real name for shipping why? technically if the mailman brings your package to the door  and you are not home he is suppose to leave you a notice to come down to the post office and pick up your package.if you give a fake name for shipping the clerk at the postoffice is going to ask for your drivers license if you dont have a drivers license under your fake name you will not be able to pick up your package.  MOST MAILMEN WILL LEAVE YOUR PACKAGE AT THE DOOR. IF YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT THEY WILL LEAVE ANOTICE TO PICKUP.IF IT IS RAINING THEY WILL LEAVE A NOTICE TO PICKUP.            IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MAIL DELIVERY IN USA FEEL FREE TO ASK

    Another good idea, and I found this out from being a big ebay seller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always include the +4 Zip Code. If you don't know it, go to USPS.com and click-look up zip codes. - Put in your address, just leave out your zip. It will return with your address, they way they want it to look, and it's always all caps, so I don't get these vendors saying, "Orders with addresses in ALL CAPS will be cancelled. Usually overseas, if you're a US vendor, and you don't know that, you should.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That zipcode +4 - saves it from one extra step of being "hand sorted". One less pair of hands? Sounds worth it to me!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ever see a computer generated sticker under your address on a letter? Usually on like a birthday card that has a hand written address. Because it doesn't have the +4, it gets rejected by the scanner on the
    <br/>
    <br/>
    conveyor belt, and lands in a big bin. Then it sits there waiting for someone to come back from their 4th mandated coffee break of the day (Unions???) They then take each parcel/letter, type in the address,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and it gets that sticker with the +4 zip on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All of that could have been avoided if the +4 were on there already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could make a days difference! - 5pm! Drop what you're doing, time to go home, and your drugs get to sit there another day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think I've made my point.
