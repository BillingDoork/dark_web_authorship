    I ordered some boomers from Catfish916 about 6 days ago.
    <br/>
    I paid using a MoneyPak.
    <br/>
    And I misspelled my street address by one letter.
    <br/>
    I asked the vendor if he could track it and he said it would be delivered yesterday,
    <br/>
    but nothing has come yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this normal or should I concerned?

    I'm no expert, but if you paid with Moneypak then there's no escrow, meaning you're not covered if it does go missing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope it's just the postal system at this time of year that's holding things up for you, but if nothing else what you should get from this is the lesson that you must do a significant amount of research before purchasing on Silk Road. If the vendor isn't extremely well established (which looking through the posts on here this guy isn't, although he does have some decent feedback) but asks you to pay in advance (i.e FE or 'Finalize Early') say no, and just look elsewhere. Paying with anything but Bitcoins is just a bad idea i would say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He may be an honest guy and send you your stuff, it may just be stuck in the post due to Christmas, or it may have been seized, but in the future use Bitcoins, get your address right and stay in escrow until you have the stuff in your hand/nose/lungs etc etc. Protect yourself as much as you can as a buyer....you're not buying a microwave from Ebay, you're buying drugs from a drug dealer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck, i hope it comes through for you :)

    You should only pay using Bitcoins. I believe you will not get your item. Since you paid using a MoneyPak you are outside of escrow and thus have no recourse in the event of a dispute.

    Today I received an order which took 10 days to arrive but usually it takes 2-3 days to receive something from this vendor.
    <br/>
    It is Christmas period so post service is overloaded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But as others said: next time use BTC and don't FE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wish you luck with this order!
