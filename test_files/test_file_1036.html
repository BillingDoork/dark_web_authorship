    I am going to have to sign for a sizable international package from another country into the U.S. Not that I want to, but this is required from a vendor that ships internationally large shipments. With smaller shipments, it wasn't a problem since re-shippers must have shipped domestically. Any vender have some input on this topic? I hear more than 2-3 days at customs, it could be a indicator of problems. Thanks. :-\

    Hello--
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well aren't they going to bring it to you? When they do...just sign...like you would for any other package..there is a HUGE myth on here that signing for something means you will get in trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    YOU WILL NOT!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now if they are asking you to go up there and sign for it...I would go(as they already know about you anyways) and then tell them " What am I signing for? I am not expecting anything" and you should get " hell him I know I guess you will find out when you open it!" And then if you just sign it and leave you have no issue( if they want you to sign for it and open it then you can refuse it)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bottom line is signing for something is not going to get you in trouble. PERIOD. But use common sense. I have heard of paranoid people signing for it...then not opening it..there reason being is that they will wait for a few days and if someone was to come over there looking for the package they could say " oh I don't even know where it is..I think I threw it in the back seat..I have not even opened it yet" and since they did not open it they will not get in trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But that is again not thinking! as ANYONE that gets a package...especially one you didn't know was coming..you would open it! So not opening it even looks more suspicious..then again it just looks that way...as in reality..you can not get in trouble for signing for a package. PERIOD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now you did say you have gotten quite a few from this guy from over seas....that is a red flag.. If your address is getting a lot of packages from over seas ....that could flag you. Again not that big a deal..but you know whats in them..so it is... I would use caution..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And whats in it? That matters too
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But the real bottom line is this...if the guy on the truck brings you a fed ex package..then sign for in...just as you would any other time you get a package...no one...I repeat NO ONE..ever looks before they sign...they just sign....and again signing for a package does not mean you know what is inside or that you accept it..it is just saying you received it. PERIOD.
    <br/>

    I think the main concern over signing for a package and then taking it in to your residence is what else they might find, assuming that LEO have a warrant that is. They will turn your possibly dirty house upside down and any drugs/paraphernalia they find will not only get more charges brought up against you, but it will look bad for your defense in court claiming that you had no knowledge of the package and that you are not a drug user/dealer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, moral of the story is to keep your house as clean as possible and if you get suspicious of anything at all when expecting a package, it's best to go ahead and clean what you do have in your house.

    If you're going to sign for a FEDEX International package with a decent amount of drug quantity then you better be sure the destination address, your home, your office, and your phones/computers are completely clean.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure it is tempting to order qty from China or India for cheap but no way would I have a FEDEX package like that delivered to any drop in any way connected to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.

    Let's also not forget that couriers like FEDEX, UPS, etc. do not need probable cause/warrant to open packages they deem suspicious and then notify LEO. Personally, anytime I get a wild hair and order International, I keep the house clean as a mug.

    FedEx is the number 1 courier in the states to bust buyers. They do sting operations, going out of their way to work with federal agencies, to take down sellers AND buyers. Not sure what applies to fedex international, as my knowledge of their domestic practices has kept them out of consideration completely. I've done my share of international drug smuggling, signing for a package is just something you do. Its the fedex part I'd be worried about. may sound like fearmongering to you but I've seen too many fed ex suits handed to swat captains in my day.  I would and have used just about any other international shipper than fedex.

    Actually, FedEx doesn't spill the beans as frequently as UPS does.  When the US Govt was investigating online pharmacies (not SR, the shady looking sites that sell boner pills from India), they determined that UPS and FedEx weren't doing enough to stop the flow of these illegal drugs through their systems.  UPS took it on the rear and settled with the US Govt and is submitting to more invasive searches and instituting more strict search policies to weed out drug shipments.  FedEx, on the other hand, couldn't disagree more with the US Govt's assertion that they (FedEx) aren't doing enough to stop the flow of drugs through their systems.  FedEx doesn't think it's their job to do the US Govt's job and fight the US Govt's war on drugs, and their CEO and leadership has made statements to that effect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sorry I don't have the clearnet link to proof, but a Google search would uncover it.  Hope this helps you evaluate your options for your next International shipment...... FedEx &gt; UPS because they don't bend over backwards to snitch on you.

    Thanks for everyone's feedback. I agree it's a numbers game and you just hope the majority come through. I agree that the drop needs not to be linked to your name and that it can be abandoned quickly when need be.

    You gotta remember there are tons of packages coming in and the more packages that go through the clearing house the more money they make. Don't be surprised if duties/taxes are required.

    Good point about the duties/taxes. I guess that would be recharged to the vender, or would I have to pay that?

    The US Govt will most definitely demand the duties/taxes from you, the receiver.  You would be required to pay before you can leave with your package.  If the vendor stealthed your product with something that they charge a duty on, I would hope that the vendor is ready to help you pay for any extra charges!
