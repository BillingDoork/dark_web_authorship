    I was expecting a package today and it never arrived. It was posted a week ago and would usually only take 4 days from where I ordered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm hoping there is just a delay and that I will get it tomorrow. I didn't know about this Operation Pangea until after I ordered. What a load of shite that is!!

    My fairly regular package from a reputable seller is delayed as well. It always takes 3 days max and it is over a week now and still nothing.

    i lost something to pangea iv last year. i was greatful to see the pangea v warning in the shipping forum last week as i wanted to place an order. the guy who gave the initial warning got called every name at first, i would suspect those attacking him were not from countries with customs as determined as here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i hope it doesn't put him off giving a similar warning next year. hope ur package makes it thru.

    I am beginning to get really worried too.  I have a pretty big order missing from a domestic vendor I've used a lot in the past, I'm in the UK.  It has been 4 working days now and every other time I've ordered from the vendor it came the next day.  I don't think I'll use this site anymore if it doesn't arrive.  If Royal Mail has caught on it's not worth risking money on the off chance I might receive something, it's better to buy on the streets.  Fucking sucks, but it is what it is.  Not only is it a pain in the ass to get bitcoins now but it seems even domestic orders are risky now.

    Hi, a shame to admit but I lost two letters from two different locations both seized by customs. Both letters were due to arrive in September . Instead I got two letters from the Irish customs. Shit happens, I can say.

    Shit, that sucks balls. My package didn't arrive today either, so I am fearing that I will get a customs letter as well, especially with that Pangea bullshit thing going on. I'm in Ireland as well and it seems the customs are catching a lot of letters lately. Sincerely hope that I get my stuff tomorrow and not a customs letter. :/

    how are so many letters being caught in ireland

    unless the vendor is failing to vac pack with fairly shoddy packaging or a red flag country such as NL then they should be very difficult to detect

    A few issues this end sending out packages, the majority have got through but a couple have taken a lot longer than anticipated.

    All my sales are domestic in the UK, hopefully the couple which are delayed/missing turn up soon, fucking postal workers why do they want to do something like this :( lol

    I really dont want to down play Operation Pangea, It maybe as serious as everybody things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but going off their stats from last year:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some 45,500 packages inspected by regulators and customs authorities, of which almost 8,000 were seized;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is over a 1 week period. And 81  counteries are involved?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    does anyone want to guess how many packages are sent in 81 counteries in a 1 week period. then compare that to the 45,500 packages inspected? do you think thats a big dent?
