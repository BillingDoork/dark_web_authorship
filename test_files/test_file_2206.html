    Can anyone recommend the above vendor for shipment to Aus?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor tells me he is happy with Escrow so looking for someone to back them up so I can give it a go.

    For fuck's sake. THINK PEOPLE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why o why must we make it any fucking harder on ourselves and easier on those who wish to shut us down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chat to the vendor over PM or SR messages, feel them out, review their general feedback threads and then make your own fucking mind up. Or PM someone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But for the love of SR, STOP ASKING FOR OR POSTING BLATANT INFORMATION with specifics. There's no need.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just stop it. This ain't fucking ebay. IT'S FUCKING ILLEGAL. There's LOTS of people really keen to shut this place down. Why help them?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And just in case, I'll explain it again for the kids not paying attention in the back row. STOP FUCKING ASKING FOR OR POSTING SPECIFICS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about it; you ask about ND's record. A few pop up and say "he's fucking brilliant, got it to my door in 6 days in Australia, stealthy as all fuck. Guess what's going to happen? Mr. LE is going to order from him and find out what the deal is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I'm POSITIVE they already have, but for fuck's sake, let's not poke them with a stick now shall we?
