    Two serious amounts of stuff coming from a popular supply counry had cuts in the envelopes and it was clear as day what was in each of them.
    <br/>
    Both of them still arrived, and heard nothing from the authorities since. WTF?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like the amounts in them were definatley enough for a sentence. Opinions?

    In what way were there cuts? Like as if they stuck a knife in to sample whatever was inside?

    Could be a thieving postman with no interest in drugs, it's mostly casual staff at this time of year and thefts go through the roof.

    A thief is a thief and if they see something of value they're gonna do whats in their nature. I don't buy into that though. I received a 5gm envelope today from the UK that looked like it had cuts in it but truth is I think its just damage. Unless the po po are on their way now, I'd assume just damage going through all the machines and conveyor belts and shit. They wouldn't see 5gms of a Schedule 1 drug and be like 'nah, we'll let that pass'

    @Noahg, write "RETURN TO SENDER" across the envelope in black marker, and leave it by the door.
    <br/>
    If 'da po-leese' come knocking, then you weren't expecting this package - in fact, you were going to drop it back in the mailbox next time you went out.
