    waiting on pkg, ordered same pkg two weeks ago was sent on monday received wednesday. so, i ordered anothere last weekend and unfortunately,was shipped saturday but miased drop off/pick up time.. so does that mean my pkg wasnt sent out until monday? or do they still pickup drop boxes on sunday.. ? expected same ship time due to same shipping method.. now i understand priority and first class times can vary but heres where paranoia comes in. yesterday go get mail and to my surprize there was no mail,usually always get sumtin. so this morning go up to put letter in to send out and to my surprize there was yesterdays mail in my box.. so right away start freaking out in my head.. did sumone take my mail then put back wasnt good yesterday?? etc. so i waited for mail lady,and unfortunately no pkg today either or yesterday,she accidentally put my couple bills in my neighbors mail yesterday and neighbor just put back in my box.. now this never happened and was assured by mail lady,same mail lady for over ten years,that last two days there were no pkgs left at mine or both my neighbors boxes and after multiple sincere apologies from her,she went on her way and promised all pkgs will now be left on my porch,no matter size!! As u can imagine ,as stoner and psychonaut ,and with heavy use of sativa last three days my mind is going crazy...Wow lol

    Haha ain't paranoia a bitch?  ;D check this out:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I order some ice with express delivery option. Of course I'm waiting by the window for the damn mailman to come even though it's way early. Then the mailtruck shows up - DRIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE STREET  :o :o - drops my express package in the box, then speeds away and doesn't stop at any other houses on the street. Then about an hour later (by this time I'm spun) the mailtruck comes down the street delivers mail like usual at every stop... including mine again.   :o  :-\ ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Weirdest thing I ever saw. I dunno if it was supposed to be delivered the day before and the guy was racing to get get it out before starting the route, Or maybe it got put on the wrong truck and the guy made a detour to deliver it because it was, after all, "Express". Or maybe the damn vendor himself dressed up like a mailman and dropped it off himself just for goof!  :P :-X Who the fuck knows?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just gotta learn to love that paranoia - it's part of the high.

    No this has happened to me when i had express packs dropped at my place before i got my PO box, express packs are supposed to be delivered by either 10:30am or 3:00PM so sometimes the Post office just sends a vehicle to deliver those to make the time before your regular mail comes if i guess they realize the regular mail will be late, but sometimes i've gotten them past that timeframe on the regular mail truck.  Its the post office and they're screwed up, no with my PO box my packs are dropped in there by 10:30 AM and i don't have deal with slow mailtrucks

    none other than the fact it was somewhat disassembled. even had two mags. be careful who u buy from though. some want the money first, and never go with someone who has negatives. my guy had a plus 10. also dont try and buy an ak. way too big and heavy to risk shipping in my opinion.

    +1 Thanks for letting me know - otherwise I probably would have really freaked when it happened again on the next Express delivery!
