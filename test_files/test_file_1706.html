    Hello everyone,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have looked high and low for the answer to this question and I have yet to find a reasonable answer in regards to printing anonymous postage. If anyone can point in the direction please reply to my thread, or, if you prefer message me privately, either way I will be very much grateful and would be glad to donate a coin to your personal wallet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks guys

    click n' ship with a visa gift card, most likely easiest way, I think. Set up the USPS account with fake but legit sounding info or open a click 'n ship commercial account with a real business whose shipping method won't conflict with what you're sending (or pick a business that doesn't ship anything). Least not 'til you came around. ; )

    Can you recommend a specific visa card? I'm not aware of any that allow you to be completely anonymous in using them

    As long as you don't need a SSN, ID, or to verify ID like with some prepaid credit cards that give you a temp card then mail you one with a name on it (though you can use just the numbers on the temporary one right away) I think just using fake info would suffice, no?

    Nope guys. ALL prepaid cards in the USA require SSN to activate and use, as well as your real information to verify with your SSN. With all the anti-terrorism and NSA bills they've been passing, this is something they really started cracking down on..... so for the love of god, do not use any card you activated with your information to buy tracking or postage. Rest assured if a LE get their hands on one of your packages, it is easily within the range of possibilities they can find out what card it was purchased with, and be at that persons house within a few days... and you won't know it till they're kicking down your door.

    Something they don't advertise, and may or may not be just a rumor (I haven't been diligent about looking into it, it's still on my giant to-do list): there are identifying markings that may be printed with every page on virtually all printers.  This allows them to trace any paper that was printed to the printer used and at least it's point of sale, if not right to the doorstep of the guy who bought it.  That would be bad if printing postage for drug shipments, methinks.  Just an FYI.

    Kiwikiikii you must not have used any prepaid cards lately. I have tried over 20 different types of prepaid cards in my states, even for very small amounts of cash, they all require that they be activated online with SSN before they can be used. It used to not be like this. Not only can you not use them online until they are activated, you can't even use them in a store without them getting declined/rejected. This was different a few months ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is not misinformation either. If LE gets your SSN then they can track you down very easily. Unless you are in a safe house without your name on any of the bills or in any databases.... still this might only make it more challenging for them.
