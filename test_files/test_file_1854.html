    Hi there.
    <br/>
    I'm a first time buyer on SR and was wondering if anyone had positive/negative experience with shipping weed to Israel.
    <br/>
    Any info on the subject would be greatly appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Yeah.
    <br/>
    read this http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0
    <br/>
    Use liberte, its the safest way.
    <br/>
    buy bitcoins using cash, since its untraceable, and whenever expecting a package keep a clean house, if the cops come knocking just ask for a lawyer and don't talk without one since they cant prove anything they'll let you go eventually.
    <br/>
    Never talk without a lawyer, say nothing.
    <br/>
    stay in escrow.
    <br/>
    You should be fine doing all of that.

    Hi!
    <br/>
    I'm from Israel as well, and I have some questions about bitcoins in Israel.
    <br/>
    I have read a lot of posts about bitcoins and how to purchase them, and in one point I realized that about 90% of what I read does not apply in Israel.
    <br/>
    I would like to know how do you get bitcoins with cash in Israel, if you feel uncomfortable answering this here please answer me in a PM.
    <br/>
    I would also like to know if you can make cash deposits in the bank, and can you use bitinstant in Israel?
    <br/>

    Here are two Near East threads, for Lebanon and Turkey.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lebanon: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20479.msg207432#msg207432
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TurkeyÂ  : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20903.msg212187#msg212187
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I believe all near easterners ought to join forces because you have very similar shipping/security problems, so it is most conducive for y'all to learn lessons off each other.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For example, Lebanon scans *all* the post. 100% of it. So do other countries in the region. Secondly Israel almost certainly has impressive machines for bomb detection in the mail system. This implies one should be extra cautious than other countries because A: the explosives detection machines are very similar to those which scan for drugs using ion spectrometry and such, and B: you should never, never ever send liquids like vials of LSD through the Israeli post. Finding a liquid is definitely a red flag for a bomb, and the machines for detecting liquids in packages are extremely good at what they do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, there is a lot you can learn from each other here.
