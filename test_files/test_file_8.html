    Currently on day 8 for a domestic order - very unusual for me... Messaged the seller about it, asking if they could check up on the DCN.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The DCN shows the package being accepted at a processing place 8 days ago, arriving at another processing place 6 days ago, then provides no further updates. It is still marked "in transit".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The seller has suggested I call USPS to check up on the status of the package... Obviously I am hesitant to do this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone ever been in a similar situation? What are your guys' perspectives?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    ^I've had the same thing happen with a non-SR order. Went from a sort facility close-by to probably 500 miles away. Maybe an addressing mix up? Who knows. All I know is that USPS is in the shitter so dont expect a perfect service every time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I suggest you find more threads on lost packages/controlled delivery. Expect your package to come and be prepared for anything else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: this actually happened to me twice, one on each end. The package eventually arrived each time.

    You can always call USPS and have them put a trace on the package....awhile back it had been about a week and a half and I still had not received one of my domestic packages so I called USPS and talked to some really nice girl who put a trace on the package for me...it showed up 2 days later, apparently it just got a little lost at the nearby processing location.
