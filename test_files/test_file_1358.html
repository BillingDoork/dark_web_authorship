    Say a package gets busted coming in overseas... Feds try to do a signed controlled delivery and nobody answers. Or alternatively, they just decide to get a warrant based on the sheer quantity, bust in and find nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would the Feds be watching that individuals? Would all mail to that individual be flagged and checked?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think the former option is likely... the latter, not so much. Maybe the address goes into some sort of database, but how does that work? Does such a database even exist? Is it the brain-child of some SR-Junkies paranoia? All mail to an individual being screened after the fact seems very unlikely. With the technology today, many things are possible, and out of these many things, many high-minds on here can jump to a lot of conclusions that might seem easy to jump to...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What would happen if the individual moved to another house and started receiving packages at that address? I'm just throwing my thoughts out here. Perhaps some others would like to chime in?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One day I will try my luck, if they ever try to CD a package on me and fail... I'll just order another package from the same source and see what happens. Hopefully a CD never does happen... 3 years ordering and never had an issue, so lets hope it stays that way.

    If I got a CD, but nothing came of it, I'd act as if I was flagged and possibly being watched (at least for a while).Â  You better believe that if they failed a CD or a bust, they'll keep their eye on you.

    Logic would argue that if they have a first failed CD, and nothing is in your house, then what's the harm in ordering more packages? Just don't sign for anything and see if there is another CD on a package you know had stealth. In my mind it will once and for all shed more light on what they do following an attempted CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally employ a home-made EMP generator to destroy any possible sensors that may be in packages, and I leave them on my porch till the end of the day.

    Yes, it's actually quite simple, with a bit of know-how... can be built with under $50 from parts at radioshack.... can easily produce enough juice to fry electronics within a 1-3 foot range... perfect for potentially bugged packages.

    You won't find one easily. Spend about 10-15 hours researching the topic and workings behind the mechanism and you can figure out how to put one together. It's actually very simple. If you're not a total idiot you could figure it out in under 2 hours. I have no degrees in the topic either, though I do consider myself more mentally adept than the average person. I mean really I just have faith in myself to figure out the things I want to figure out and I do them, nothing more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think on your feet, but have a general idea where you are going to walk with regards to the visible path ahead of you.

    Shh. I actually just removed that number from my sig because I realized it might attract some unwanted attention. No, it's not a joke, but at this point it doesn't matter as it directly pertained to my real-life operation which is no longer operational.

    You have to remember one thing LE is very good at is patience. And I think you've answered all the questions..I would assume everything under that persons name is flagged..If the person moves I don't think it would make a difference. Only have both address flagged. I would stop ordering things under that name and address.
