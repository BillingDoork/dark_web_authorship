    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been browsing the forums and SR for a while now, and I'm almost ready to make a purchase, but I have just one more question that I know has been addressed elsewhere, I've read them, but I just want one last confirmation on this game plan:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going to be using SR infrequently, and only for weed, and not much at any time either. Because of this I'm wondering if it's safe to get it sent to my home address as I don't currently have any other delivery options. I'm going to buy 7G's (This would be the largest I'd ever do in a single purchase) is that high enough to arouse a little bit too much suspicion from the delivery company and the feds or are they only interested and capable of capturing larger orders?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm buying domestically from the UK, if that helps
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mickie

    Buy from a reputable weed vendor and you should be fine. 7g is chump-change, especially to the feds (at least in the US), even an ounce here is still a disorderly conduct (depending on which state you're in, but most decriminalized states consider and ounce and under personal)

    Seems to me that even international orders are almost completely trouble-free.
    <br/>
    Domestically, I think the need for worry is non-existant. But I'm not in the UK.

    Make sure the vendor vacuum seals your weed,  or the postman will smoke it ... :'(

    Alright, thanks for the help guys. I didn't think it would be too risky buying domestic but it's nice to have some confirmation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd +1 you but I don't think I can do that yet.  :P

    You'll be fine, people order over 100g here and they're fine. Seven grams is tiny, and if it's domestic you'll be fine. Just buy from a reputable vendor and you'll have nothing to worry about.
