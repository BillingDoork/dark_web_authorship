    So for whatever reason, I did some research and this is wrong. George Washington died in 1799. Through the 1800's his birthday was unofficially celebrated every February 22. It was originally celebrated as just George Washington's birthday. It grew to include Abraham Lincoln because he is another huge name in America's history. The holiday then became a federal holiday in 1880. Richard Nixon was born in 1913.

    Crack Fox, I think the main reason I looked further into this subject was to see if I should give more credibility to SR forum posts. You've proved that I shouldn't. Why would you post something like that? If you're not sure of some facts, just look it up instead of spreading lies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOTE: I'm not saying I approve of President's Day, George Washington, or Nixon. Presidents enslave me so I don't want to celebrate them. George Washington was a thieving rapist. Richard Nixon was an ignorant, lying son of a bitch.

    oh and fuck nixon.  But i think george was pretty good since he didnt even want a president, seemed pretty libertarian (which probably equates to one of whatever the parties were called back then). or i could be absolutely wrong, havent done much research on him.

    I was a little nervous that I was going to start some big fight or something between you and I but I figured it's worth it for the truth. I was caught off guard by your politeness. I can really respect a person admitting where they're wrong. Of course, I didn't actually mean your post was the deciding factor of believing everything or nothing on SR it was just going to be a way to help me gauge it. Thank you for appearing to not be one of the horrible people who only make our society worse.

    This thread lifted my spirits as I'm awaiting a package and have been pacing/shitting myself all day. No package came of course! I looked up postal holidays though as I was waiting for the mailman and if I remember correctly, the next one isn't until May 27th. We all may want to plan accordingly. The holidays always fuck me over as well and I get VERY pissed when I realize there is no mail.
