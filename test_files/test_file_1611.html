    For starters, you can access the site with Tor and Javascript disabled, and they don't require registration. Nevertheless, I'd be weary of ordering from them. Stay safe all.

    Sounds like a brilliant idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But who's?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could there possibly be a single on line shipper who's also into BTC, completely unaware of SR and sending entirely legit and legal items??

    All these bitcoin shipping services popping up will suffer from the same problem/ people will ship drugs through them causing their account to get flagged and monitored. Stamps will always be the best way to ship anonymously.

    Also the site opened yesterday (from a bitcoin talk thread), the odds of someone randomly picking up on it and posting it on here in a day is pretty slim, meaning White 0ut = bitcoinlabels.com owner. Hey White 0ut, enjoy getting a knock every day from druggies mailing loose drugs around lol.

    Very sketchy.  Why would you even promote this White 0ut?  I already made a public warning about another website identical to this website.
