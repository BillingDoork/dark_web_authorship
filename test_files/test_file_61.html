    Hi, I'm a new user and have recently made two purchases off SR...One of the packages arrived yesterday but the other one I suspect will arrive tomorrow. Thus far, great experience with the vendors so far as far as shipping goes. The problem is that the SR website is down and has been for me since I received one of the packages. I feel bad because I'm sure the vendor would like me to finalize the shippment but obiously that's not possible since SR is down. I've read some people have been able to log on sporadically since the site has been down so i'm a little worried the vendor may think I'm being slow to finalize or trying to scam him. Is there some type of down-time protocol for buyers who want to finalize a shippment? I also have another situation. Since the site is down, I can't verify the actual listed amount on his ad that I bought and want to verify that it is the same that he/she sent because when it arrived, I thought it was suppose to be way more than he sent, but when my suspicion started to creep in doubt in my mind and I wanted to verify that I didn't just read the ad the wrong way, I could no longer log into SR. If it turns out that he sent me something other than what was advertised, is there a way to handle this without it escalating? If it turns out it's different than what was advertised, but the rest of the experience was good, how should rating be done? By the way, the other thing I ordered is different than the first thing so I know they aren't mixed up. I just want to make sure I do this right so I don't get shorted but at the same time, I am not inappropriately down rating the transaction. It didn't cost a lot, and he may have made a mistake in his ad and because it was so little, I don't feel like making a big scene out of it, but at the same time, I want to know that it was just an accident or something so he doesn't do it to another larger order in the furture.

    lol dont panic, the vendor will already know people cant FE... as for the product being not what was described, 1st contact the vendor to see if u can come to some arrangement or if ur still not happy take ur order/argument to the resolution center (resolve button) and let SR admins decide whats fair (when SR is up again, as u can do nothing untill then),  but rule of thumb here never FE untill u r happy that u got what u ordered... as for the rating its entirely up to u...!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also all the questions u have asked here have been asked 1000s of times across the forums, all u have to do is search keywords or phrases, in the search tab on the forum home page...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hope this helps, and welcome to SR...  ;)
