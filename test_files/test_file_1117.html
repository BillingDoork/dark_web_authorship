    "Moisture Barrier Bags are used in the Electronics and Pharmaceutical Industry" are these the right ones because from what I saw from one supplier they look like pretty much like the bags which you get when you first buy a harddrive. Spoke to them they said they offer them in 6mm thick.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it better to buy a film and product your own sizes of bags or better buy preset sizes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Suggestions?

    I believe they are listed as foil bags or mylar bags, but I am also in your situation, would be nice for some to confirm who knows exact what they are.

    I can see a possible problem. It seems like you are getting some bits and pieces together to start vending? (Why else would you need stealth packaging equipment).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just keep in mind that if you buy a bunch of packaging materials from other SR vendors you are letting them see a postal address that can possibly reveal your identity depending on how smart you are about receiving your orders. As a vendor you don't want anyone knowing addresses that can be linked to you. So be smart with your drop addresses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I was a cop seeking to gather intelligence about people dealing (vending) on SR, what better way than to set up a store and sell legal products that other vendors are going to need. That would be an ACE way of gathering intelligence about possible vendors on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone else think that? Or am I just paranoid - looking for deceits where there probably are none?

    Ordering these products from SR exposes vendors to unnecessary risk, as kmfkewm explained a month ago:

    <br/>
    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=144097.0
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You shouldn't buy products that that serve as evidence you are a vendor / drug distributor and link you to a physical address. It's as bad as ordering drugs under your vendor account.

     They are not hard to find. "3M Dri-Shield 2000" or higher are the good brand name ones I am aware of. QSource and Uline have been mentioned. Food storage suppliers may be good? Head shops and grower supply stores might carry em if you talk em into it? Best to find em on your own so we don't all go to the same places at once. I'd say it is good to buy in person (over the counter) if you can find em close enough. I think Cabela's may have some decent seal-a-meal gadgets. I hear QSource's blue "3M" impulse sealers are the exact same as the much cheaper blue "ULine" ones.

    They are basically the higher quality anti-static bags. They are also anti-moisture (moisture Barrier Bags). There are many quality choices. 3M scc 1000 for instance are thin and see-through but likely better than common food-grade vacuum bags. 3M DriShield 2000 are like 3 mils thick and a visual barrier. The 3000 series is like 6+ mils thick - good for international shipping or extra smelly stuff, I'd say.
    <br/>
    I like the pre-made bags as I only have to seal one side extremely well. The other 3 sides have excellent seals that make me feel extra confident. I have not seen 3M Dri-shield come as rolls anywhere yet.

    I appreciate the input pal, but no chance I would make a stupid mistake like that, I am a paranoid type by nature and like to think I move in calculated steps. And besides it helps I believe it helps to get it right it before hand rather then as you go along? I too have noticed new vendors too eager to sell, doing half ass work and getting corrected by other vendors all the time.

    When I'm good and ready, we shall see.

    good points, though to clarify with these higher quality anti-static bags with moisture protection - are they designed to keep moisture from getting in or from getting out? should one turn the bag inside out to use it for our purposes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for example, that milspec foil sold on sr has a specific layered construction, if you used it the wrong way it may not be as effective?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also just read on a vendor profile that MBBs are a red-flag on x-rays because of their reflective surface, i'm not sure if there is any truth to that claim though...

     good points, though to clarify with these higher quality anti-static bags with moisture protection - are they designed to keep moisture from getting in or from getting out? should one turn the bag inside out to use it for our purposes?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     for example, that milspec foil sold on sr has a specific layered construction, if you used it the wrong way it may not be as effective?

     Also just read on a vendor profile that MBBs are a red-flag on x-rays because of their reflective surface, i'm not sure if there is any truth to that claim though...

    They are non permeable, nothing gets in and nothing gets out.

    Re x-ray from what I understand they do not cause a reflection as they are not think enough, the organic material in the MBB will still be visible on the scanners though so if it's getting scanned it probably gone anyway, the entire purpose of using MBB's is so the dogs do not react to the package and therefore it doesn't get scanned at all, can you imagine if customs decided to scan all letter mail? never going to happen.
