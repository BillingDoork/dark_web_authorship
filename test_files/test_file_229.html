    I was recently pondering ways to improve buyer security, and the most obvious one to me seemed to be using addresses which had no connection to the buyer whatsoever, yet would be readily available and not in use by anyone else. Foreclosed homes came to mind, as there are online directories devoted to listing them and in the USA foreclosed homes are not hard to come by. With a little work, I don't think it would be difficult to connect an address to its owner's former name, and one could simply put that as the person the letter is addressed to so as to avoid a mismatch between a fake name and a real address (a common red flag in the postal system). Does anyone know if mail is still delivered to homes under foreclosure? Does this trigger any red flags from the postal system?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?

    Foreclosed homes in my area are marked with a sticker in the window and the post office is notified they are vacant. Not counting previous tenets mail forward could catch your package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Back in the 90's people would use foreclosed homes and vacant addresses to have stuff shipped to that they charged to stolen credit cards. It became so common that some things like the stickers and post-office notification have become standard practice for the banks.

    Like the guy mentioned before, abandoned/foreclosed houses are often used in credit card fraud, i knew this before i knew about the drugs thing. personally i dont waste my time looking for them for that fact. waking up bright and early and travelling god knows how long to get to a house and hoping the postie doesnt notice its not even in use is not worth it imo. then again im always the kinda guy to ride shit out til it hits the fan
