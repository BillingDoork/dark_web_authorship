    You think there's a high(er) chance of getting caught ordering from a few vendors at once? Should it not be shipped to my house? What's the most you've ordered at once? I feel like it would come in several different packages..?    sketchy

    If you can avoid it, then do that.  If you can't avoid it, try to at least ship it somewhere that isn't your house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact is, when one package is sent to one address, that's one chance the feds have to profile, flag, and intercept your package.  When two packages are sent to one address from two different vendors, thats two chances the feds have to profile, flag and intercept.  Which is all okay, except if they intercept one package and find illegals in it, chances are, they will also go further and intercept the other packages going to the same desitnation address and find more illegals, thus adding to your troubles and giving them the extra evidence they were looking for..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a general rule, use "dead drops" or locations that can't directly be lnked to you, and that would give you deniabilty in case the packages were in fact seized.  Also, try not to use the same address too often or for too long.  If you use PO Boxes, switch your PO number every few orders and try not to give the PO office your real address and name if you can avoid it.  The goal is that if the law showed up and accused you of ordering illegal stuff online, you should be able to say "no I didn't" and leave them nothing with which they can charge you.  It's just having 10 seperate packages arriving at the same location with your name on them will not go unnoticed once LE catches on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Better safe than sorry, especially in this realm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FWIW, I once had 3 orders coming to 3 addresses that were about 30 minutes apart.  they all ended up arriving on the same day, which kind of sucked driving-wise, but the point is if one of those orders was a controlled delivery, then LE would only have one piece of evidence, not 3, and one piece of evidence is much easier to defend than 3.

    I'd argue that is even stronger evidence that you were set up if a shit ton of packages came and for some reason LE was involved. I have had 4 orders before and been fine. Just order small or domestic and your fine.

    From a legal perspective a lot of orders at once could better better than several over time. As all at once you could say "lol some idiot trying to set me up what me I never ordered this shit?!?!?!" but over time it's blatantly you.

    ^what I was trying to say.....if they are all small domestic orders though I don't see how it should matter as supposedly LE doesn't know what packages are coming from where and they should all look like regular mail anyway.

    Personally I wouldn't be ordering from more than one vendor at a time. I believe it does increase your risk profile. This, too, can backfire. If it's feasible it's best to have more than one address to ship to.

    Around 4/20 I ordered at least 15 ounces of weed from up to 8 different vendors, some of which being bulk, some for grams.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All to my PO Box, about 1/4th of the packages I had to sign for or special request the post man to get it because it didn't fit in the PO Box
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Each package came from California, and 2-3 from Canada, all within 2 days of 4/20.... several packages from California on 4/20, one from Canada, and one big one from Cali that I had to request the guy get for me because it wouldn't fit in my PO Box. Lol, one day I recieved 4 boxes from California all from senders. Nobody asked any questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Doesn't matter if they know what's up, they can't just say, hey I think this guy has drugs he ordered a lot of packages from this state... not to mention the day I ordered them on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have still ordered consistent WEIGHT to my PO box and nothing has happened yet. I firmly believe that the only probable chance of getting caught is if your vendor is stupid with the packaging, and it has proven to be true for the past year.

    I disagree. First they have to have solid proof of your past packages... which the USPS simply does not keep a database of every single package you have ever recieved, it would be impossible, the amount of data and extra work interms of entering it all into the system. And considering the amount of times they would have to go back and track a package months ago in the system(practically none)... It's just implausible for them to keep a database of all packages recieved at your address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On top of that, they would have to prove it was you ordered it, and that you received it, and thirdly that there was illicit content in the package. For one, the sender address isn't even entered into the computer unless it is actually being returned to the sender. The mail man cannot remember every package you ever received... it's simply impossible they handle TONS of mail aday, and spend not even a minute at your mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first 10 times I ordered on SR, I ordered to my neighbors house who had weird work hours 10am-8pm. The mail always came when he was at work. I always just got my package off his front door or out of the mail box, since due to our location, it didn't look suspicious, me checking the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are too many variables for them to use past packages as evidence against a single package being found to have drugs in it.

    I disagree with you. If USPS finds something suspicious in your first package, they'll then start making a record of all the others. Let them all arrive and then wham bam thank you mam more to convict you with in court. They don't just stop one then let all the others after go though....

    You guys give USPS waaaay too much credit, Folks were talking about a Government agency that's 10 years behind the competition and literally on the verge of bankruptcy. Your mailman has almost ZERO authority when it comes to your mail, He/She can't refuse to deliver it, Can't tamper with it and certainly can't open it. Does anyone remember the cluster fuck that was the Anthrax scare? You saw all these Postal Inspectors and Federal Agents on TV with their thumbs up their asses. These incompetent Government bureaucrats just aren't that organized.

    Simplest is just to deliver it at home under your real name.

    Plenty of topics from guys who use a PO box under a fake name and than they get mail sent which doesn't fit in it.. So they have to go to the post office and grab the mail which isn't under their name..

     Only in special occasions like 420 it can happen that you receive a lot at once ::)

      Plenty of topics from guys who use a PO box under a fake name and than they get mail sent which doesn't fit in it.. So they have to go to the post office and grab the mail which isn't under their name..

    No doubt, I order a lot of shit on Ebay from China and that packaging always looks sketchy. More and More people are doing there shopping online these days it's not unusual for ppl to receive lots of packages.

    *If anyone here ever does get in trouble or questioned by LEO regarding packages, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT DENY EVERYTHING. Most people that get busted for shit, It's usually because they don't know to shut the fuck up when the PIGS arrive. LEO's will sit back and listen to you talk your way right into a jail cell.

    Lol yes, I recently ordered something from Hong Kong and although it arrived quicker than something I ordered here from Germany (next to Holland), it was a package all covered in tape with stuff written on it and all that.. Could barely read the address and stuff. Was surprised it even made it to my house.
