    Guess this is right  board to post on . So ordered on sat 7/20(whch vendor messaged saying they now ship on sat) vendor put in transit 7/24 and is supposed to get here (according to vendor)7/30.  I am just wondering if anyone else would have messaged seller on 7/27 wondering? Well I did and they got all huffy with me and I told them was just going on info they put on vendor page describing shipping ,

    "We ship  Monday-Friday. Please allow up to 48 hours for your order to be processed. Packages are currently being processed and received within 3-4 business days from the time of order placement (subject to change)."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and that i t led me to believe they ship faster than most. I mean am I in the wrong for asking what the deal is? I was thinking and under impression I would have order by end of week at latest. I placed order with different vendor same day 1min apart from that one  and  got it wed. Sooo
