    As a paranoid drug user, I've often thought it should be standard practice for vendors to change the return address on packages from time to time. Say LE found a SR package with excellent stealth and a return address on it, couldn't they let sorting offices know the return address so that if another package came through it would be flagged bringing LE closer to the source of the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a thought...

    You've definitely got a point.  I'm fairly sure most of the well established vendors switch things up at least monthly with return addresses.  I've heard of vendors changing every 10 orders, every week, or not at all a whole range.

    I pretty much never reuse them for more than a week. It is really easy to get a new return address.

    I personally change mine every week, even though I think it's pretty unlikely for cops to convince the mail system to flag a specific return address. I don't even think the computers can read return addresses like that. Addresses aren't even entered into the computer..... When mail travels around the country it is primarily done so by the zip-code, and the addresses on the package are not even looked at until it gets to your local town. In fact the zip code isn't even manually entered in unless the computer cannot read it when it is on the belt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I have had many repeat customers request I use a very specific return address each time, as to reduce suspicion for them receiving packages from room-mates/parents. Receiving multiple packages from the same city on a long-term basis from different companies can raise flags.

    I've wondered about this same thing too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like, do vendors use fake return addresses or one they could actually access? Is retrieving packages that may have been returned to sender important to vendors? I'm just curious about all of this. :) (If anyone wants to answer this question for me thru PM so that nothing is written here, feel free to do so. ;) )

    I spoke with a life long friend and asked him to speak with his father (a postmaster of a decently sized city) in a non-direct manner about drugs through the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From what I gathered, regular packages from CA will be a red flag after awhile, and it has been like that for awhile now. This just confirmed what I had already suspected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But what I am currently still wondering, is how frequent (and over what length of time) would packages with the same mailer yet different return addresses from the same city/area (that either cycle between a few different businesses, or change every time) become suspicious. I think weekly packages from the same person/business in CA would become suspicious rather quickly. But if you have packages with the same mailer/box that are coming from the same general area over a period of time at random intervals would that look too suspect to the average observer? Or is it overly paranoid to expect a pattern being connected from just meager circumstantial clues like the same packaging from drug source areas regularly?

    It would be overly paranoid, I think. In a previous life I worked closely with a merchandising company based out of LA, and received close to hundreds of packages from their warehouse to resell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, randomizing those return addresses takes such little time it would be negligent not to!

    This brings up a whole different question.
    <br/>
    I am about to vend and I planned on using the same type of box for every package. The idea is to package it so professionally that it fits in with the rest of the mail, making it unable to profile. Is this not good enough?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, if I go to the post office in one state, and the return address is in another state will it get flagged? This is for the United States.

    Started a similar thread on this and came to the conclusion that each vendor probably has their own strategy, and they probably won't share it if it puts them at risk in any way.

    Well I don't think it's necessary to change packaging as frequent as I do, but I do it anyway. I mix it up and make it look different to reduce the slim chance of any (domestic) seizures any more.
    <br/>
    As for the return address, I'm not sure because I'm from Australia. I know here the return address is not even checked unless necessary. But if someone did see it was a different state, it would look weird and stand out.

    Multiple packages from California get flagged? That's stupid... Even for my legitimate mail, 80% of the crap that I order of Amazon/Ebay comes from California.... that's just how Cali is, a very economically active state. It's not like if you order a bunch of stuff from there that they will immediately assume you are ordering drugs, get a warrant, and start watching your house. *.*. Yeah it might be a 'red flag' but only in a game of capture the flag that no one gives a fuck enough to watch.
