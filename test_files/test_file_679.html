    Hey \all, ive always ad mail deliveerd to my flat with no problem, and ive moved ecently to our house and i have never not had a package turned up. Unfortunatlety, my missus will be off work for a while, and previoulsy ive always been home before her. I am certain she will open my mail and that cant happen, as she will just go skitz. My question is is there another way of sendign packages to other addresses without raising suspicions. Other frinds houses is a bad idea, really not in the habit of dropping others in it. My work place will deleiver mail unponed to my desk ... maybe too risky in case something was found .... does snyone have any other ideas of getting addresses set up?

    Have you considered getting a PO box? I don't think they're too expensive, just make sure you get some normal mail sent there too so it doesn't look suspicious.

    I use a PO box for SR orders, but some vendors will not ship to PO boxes (I don't know the reasons why, I plan to post a topic about it later).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have never not had an order arrive to my PO box.  About 35 orders.  Some were international and required signature, so they leave a slip in the box and I have to sign at the desk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally think the PO box is good because (if you associate a fake identity), then there is practically no chance of a controlled delivery.  If your package is intercepted by USPS (which it shouldn't be if you are buying from a respected vendor), then the best they can do is post a LE officer at the post office until you or your representative show up to get the package.  They will have no idea when the package will be claimed, so that option is all but off the table.  The only other thing that would happen is they would just confiscate the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But again, I've never not had an order make it to my box.

    There are always ma and pa shipping businesses that rent boxes and then you will have a street address and not a PO Box. I have one with 24hr access and so far so good. I like the fact too that I can order things online that I do not want stolen off my porch that I use for my legal business entity. I live in an area that is prone to petty theft and so it is a win win deal for lots of reasons. I do not receive anything other than personal use items on SR from trusted vendors who pay attention to looking normal. I do not deal the stuff I buy ever. If you use a false ID DO NOT get a PO Box. If you are busted there will be extra charges for defrauding the Government.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best to keep the wifey and your boss out of your SR business, that would seem the polite thing to do.

    I agree with PrinceBlack49, a private postal box is the way to go for several reasons. And get a DBA or ficticious business name to have packages addressed to. Some kind of eBay seller is perfect, just make sure the return address is a real address. I have ordered from the UK (which was packaged very shitty twice,) Thailand, and large parcels from India and have never lost a package. I attribute that to having a business name for the address. International business to business is much more common that business to person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, not to give you relationship advice but if you are married to somebody who doesn't condone drug use and you like to use, you have bigger problems. I would sit her down and explain that you like to do certain substances for recreation and it's really no different than having a few beers or a glasses of wine in the evening or on the weekend. My wife smoke the ganj, but that's about it. She knows I like to use opies and benzos and while she doesn't really like it, we have an understanding. As long as I'm not visibly high during the day or am exhibiting addictive behaviour she is cool with it. Meth is a deal breaker but I am allowed to do some blow if someone offers. I have had to learn the hard way that honesty with your spouse will save you so much fighting and heartbreak, not to mention a possible divorce.

    On the same note, not to turn this thread into an episode of Dr. Phil, but I've got to agree. Maybe after you open up to her she'll want to try them, love them, and you'll have and infinite drug/fuck/cuddle buddy. Maybe she'll trip the fuck out, leave you, and you'll find a girl that loves you for exactly who you are and you'll never have to worry about this again. Either or, I've got to say you turn out the winner there.

    Just try drugging her with some MDMA, wait about an hour, tell her you like drugs. Explain that she is currently on drugs and by the way she is grinning from ear to ear she evidently likes them too. If she still seems mad just insert more MDMA until you get the desired results.

     Hey \all, ive always ad mail deliveerd to my flat with no problem, and ive moved ecently to our house and i have never not had a package turned up. Unfortunatlety, my missus will be off work for a while, and previoulsy ive always been home before her. I am certain she will open my mail and that cant happen, as she will just go skitz. My question is is there another way of sendign packages to other addresses without raising suspicions. Other frinds houses is a bad idea, really not in the habit of dropping others in it. My work place will deleiver mail unponed to my desk ... maybe too risky in case something was found .... does snyone have any other ideas of getting addresses set up?

    Either get a new wife, move back out on your own, or tell her the truth. Stop being a sneaky piece of shit.

    It looks like no matter how you look at it, using most any of these methods are still going to require balls . . .  the difference is either handing a very small pair to her, or actually growing some!   And the talk you may need to have will more than likely require the second option I'm betting!

    You guys gonna take this guy seriously?  He married her because he LOVES and CARES for her.  He's not gonna just go dump her.  He definitely shouldn't.  What is a relationship based on if not trust?  I vote tell her.  Honestly if you've married You should be committed to working out anything that arises.  That being said, you've obviously probably been doing drugs since before you got married.  Explain that you felt a desperate sense of panic at the thought of losing her so you kept it a secret.  I'll wager it's true.  Explain that you love her and that drugs are also important to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You will both have to make life changing decisions.  If the relationship is to be salvaged, you'll have to be honest with her.  She will either accept it or won't.  If she doesn't accept it, you'll have to decide what's more important to you, drugs or your family.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly, what DiamondSky advised would PROBABLY work.  haha. :P  I wouldn't IN ANY WAY condone that though.  I've thought about how tempting it would be to implement such action before, however, it goes against everything I believe in.  I believe everyone should have open access to unbiased information about drugs and have access to pure chemicals.  I also believe a person should have absolute control(decision making) over what they ingest, regardless of whether they lose control and consume more(making the choice to do so) while fiending(on coke for example).

    I'm with that guy.  Man up!  "Listen, baby, I do a kilo of blow (what was it he does?  weed?  pills?  whatever) every six weeks, and it's never gonna change.  I'm not an addict, but I like my blow.  I like you, too, and I think we have a future together, but you have to accept me the way I am for this to work.  What's it gonna be, baby?"  I mean, maybe a little more loving than that, but that's pretty much the routine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And live with whatever happens.

    Yup, tell her. Unless you think she'd call the police or something crazy. But if she has no idea you enjoy certain substances it sounds like there's a certain level of deceit/dishonesty there and that's rarely if ever healthy in a relationship...
