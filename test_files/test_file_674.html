    Damn that's a lot of weed.  If I was the worker that discovered this, I would have surely filled my pockets with as much as I could before being noticed.   Sucks for both parties involved.  Pretty stupid if you ask me to ship it from LA and to have a return address listed in WA.......

    I heard a story about a contractor who bought some vanities from Home Depot. He went to open one up before an install and found 100 pounds of weed inside. If I remember correctly it all happened in the Northeast. Some other guy found some coke in a few large items he bought but wouldn't say what store he purchased the home improvement items from. If anyone needs to do some shopping or DIY stuff, you know where to go.

    Why on earth would you contact the police? That's a free car there mate! Even if I were to report it, maybe only 5 lbs turned up?

    the guy who sent that should read up on the forums about proper shipping, i mean come on,korean newspapers doused in cleaning fluid covering garbage bags that hold the weed? wow, and the fact that it came from los angeles with a return address in another state. i hope that wasnt a vendor on here.

    They never should have reported that. What a waste of ganja. It is probably a good strategy to make the return address a location where you think the person would just take the drugs for themselves instead of reporting it.
