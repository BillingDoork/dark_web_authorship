    I know I shouldn't of but I used a fake name and I know the shipment was delivered because the mailman left a change of address form, It was yellow long and narrow. The mailman handwriten "please write down the last names of every one who lives at this address" in the corner of the form. I called the local USPS and told them a "story" and about the yellow note and they said just put the names on there and the letter should return. Do you guys think its a good idea to do that? Or should I just call it a loss..?

    Well....that's what I said to my friend.....but he wants to through with it and put the" fake" name on the "people who live at this address" form...Its his ass I said I didn't want more involvement with that letter...he said ok....I'll let everyone know what happens...if this happens to them.......I guess if you take the risk to send it your house put your real name or the variation method that was mentioned above.      ???

    Now if your sender is intelligent, he did not use his real address (to send you the package). Why is that a big deal? Whoever receives that package (full of whatever, probably a controlled substance?) could 1) Call USPS and report it, or, 2) Notify Law Enforcement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have, on record, called the post office (big no-no). Also, you have received the slip. I would lay low with that drop point. Forget about the package, and hope everyone else does the same.

    Please, newbies, stop using fake or misspelled names. It's so retarded. You're just putting yourselves and vendors at risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use the full name and address that you receive utility bills and junk mail to normally. You want the mail to blend in, not stick out like a sore thumb because it's the only time you've ever had a package sent to F. Last instead of First Last in the history of you receiving mail there.

    We're the ones at risk here, and we do what we think is appropriate.  Whether we get to our house or another house, use our name or a fake name is not the sender's concern.  You aren't the one who gets cracked if it goes bad.  It's not retarded, and there are many different ways of doing this.  I've yet to have a package not arrive, and yet to have any problem with vendors...and yet to use my own name.  And I almost always finalize early.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I trust my vendors.  If shit doesn't arrive, I know my guy sent it...I don't deal with flakes...and Nobody ever spells my name right, not since I was a kid...it always arrives.  And there are houses where mailboxes are fine to use, under construction...we protect ourselves...including changing up usernames on here once in a while...being a 'newbie' is a small price to pay...if they ever do break your i.d. on one forum, you don't want them to be able to link it to your username on the other....

    Yeah I don't think I'd take that advice. It may have worked this time but if another package comes in that gets flagged with the fake name you've already written it down that this person lives at your house. Sounds like at least a small bit of self incrimination.

    Start being organized.  Sort your mail.  Put your mail that you need - bills to be paid, etc in one place and put stuff like credit card offers, religious flyers and stuff addressed to other names in another pile.  When a package arrives throw it in with the junk mail and let it sit.  For a buyer to get busted there has to be a controlled delivery, after the mail gets into your house they will wait 15 or 20 minutes to let you open it and then come busting in.  If you haven't opened it and its sitting next to the rest of the mail you don't want, that's pretty good deniability.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe you will still get arrested, maybe even charged - and your house will definitely get searched, but the if the rest of your house (and your computer) is clean and you keep your damned mouth shut there is really no way a jury is going to convict you based on an unopened letter that is addressed to someone else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The part above in parenthesis is important.  If they search your house and your windows login is unlocked and your tor icon is on your desktop and you have MtGox, SR and the forums bookmarked they are going to be able to connect the dots.  Have your computer locked down with a strong password.

    About the fake name theory, I still receive plenty of regular mail destined for previous residents of the house where I live.     The mailman  shouldn't care btw, I believe he should simply deliver whatever is destined to that address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let the current resident either throw the letter away or return to the Post office with an RTS (return to sender).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course I'm referring to regular mail, not UPS, Fedex, etc. where a valid name is indeed necessary.

    But I'm in Canada, not sure how it works in the US.

    i also get prev tenants mail at one of my addresses, tenants from 3yrs + ago....?! (uk domestic mail that is..)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i can only surmise they either knew what was in the package/letter, or the USPS do keep a db of valid recipients per physical address..?!

     About the fake name theory, I still receive plenty of regular mail destined for previous residents of the house where I live.     The mailman  shouldn't care btw, I believe he should simply deliver whatever is destined to that address.

     Let the current resident either throw the letter away or return to the Post office with an RTS (return to sender).

     Of course I'm referring to regular mail, not UPS, Fedex, etc. where a valid name is indeed necessary.

    I can speak with some manner of experience on the US and names. If they do not recognize the name as living there they will not deliver it. Now stuff does get through due to sheer volume but even in the case of moving away from a house and then moving back the previous "moved" from years ago was still in effect. Some letters got through so figured it was good to go, even sent myself a test letter to be double sure, got through - but package from SR with DCN - blocked. Said I had moved. :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think since they have to have check off and scan each DCN enabled package "bouts of efficiency" are much more likely and as such using a previous recepient is not a good idea (the only way it may work is like someone said above that there is a lot of mail going in and out and you are getting lots of tests just fine with no problems ). I mean YMMV but I'd say you're risking it. From now on we're using my roommate's name since he gets the majority of the mail here - I can get reinstated here but I don't even want to chance it after losing one package (besides it's his money too). So for your own sake and for the sake of the sellers who have to change up their methods when things miss - use a reliable name (preferably your own) if you want to be sure you'll get it. No sense in wasting BTC sending the Mail Recovery Center nice presents. :)

    ...good method..using a known name abeit not around at the moment,,,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    or a private postbox
    <br/>
    1...but then needs to be setup in probably someone elses name apart from your own.
    <br/>
    2. big enough to take padded envelopes or small parcels..
    <br/>
    3. setup / use the PO box for purely SR and non-personal correspondence, cos when it comes to an investigation they'll soon enough work out who you are by opening up your valid mail and taking note of "statements"....
    <br/>
    4. bear in mind the integrated circuit found in new issue passports or similar technology could be tagged to your package, the realtime location of the package could be tracked as is monitored in airports -they are aware of your location (unsure of accuracy in metres/foot..) within the transmitter range(s).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i've found in uk &amp; eu -you often still end up with a parcel slip in the box....but in most cases if the item fit the physical postbox you were ok.

    I think it may be different everywhere but if you live in an area that's stable it's really easy to notice. I delivered papers for years (years and years ago) and generally knew the comings and goings and new people about and didn't even handle things with people names on it. New people in a house may be tougher to notice (though there are stories of getting the form saying "Fill out who all lives there" when using some made up name) but when you're using a name of a previous resident you better believe the postman knows that person no longer lives there. They drove by everyday while they were selling, when they moved, handled the change of address, saw the new tennents coming in and their mail starting up. Automated mail sorting takes care of most of this stuff, and stuff does slip through but when they're having to confirm delivery on it, if the mailman hasn't changed they're pretty damn aware that guy doesn't live there any more. Additionally you may be dealing with an automated block where someone previous, or yourself may have wrote "No longer lives here" so that's sitting in a sorting db (which is also why if you leave and come back to a residence talk to usps to get your mail started again).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Further you hear stories of people writing just a name and a city and getting mail to people - so the USPS does have a sense of where people live if they really want to get that mail to them. Hell, that's what the Mail Recovery Centers (formerly Dead Letter Rooms) do - they track down the rightful owners of mislabeled mail. Kinda crazy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So to me it's not totally out of the realm of possibility they have a decent idea who's living where - but like I said, I live in a fairly stable area - could be very different if you live in a place with tons of turn around, temp housing etc.  Of course other countries also have totally different procedures.

    ...also based on zefka's post, i can't see how its down to a postman, whats the point ....whats in it for him....?! perhaps overzealous,,,,aside from that my view would be "stick to your job and deliver the f__king mail..."...delivery is a bloody nightmare in uk...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    postman-pat here in an around the london suburbs change all the time, sometimes its a diff one every week...!? mostly younger foreigners who i suppose sign up for something...
    <br/>
    i would guess as soon as you get outside the M25 (greater london...) and any small village it becomes the career postman....
    <br/>
    culturally (historically) the british postman is part of the community, hence has local knowledge....

    i have also heard of parcels and possibly mail being scanned....don't work in this field but it would be bloody handy to know what really goes on in those warehouses...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it wouldn't be difficult to implement a handwriting OCR system, it would just have to be pretty fast ..or reduce the speed of the letter flow...or implemented in certain parts of the process...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    its possible scanning is restricted to international items, thats how they find guns etc, its certainly not random inspections it is...?!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for instance, in holland EVERY container coming in and out of the country is xray scanned, and its a million euro setup they have, seen it in a documentary ....its manned 24x7....and you can see thru anything....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    another is the uk dover  and harwich ferry ports (probably all the others too...) every lorry/truck is also weighed and scanned....they feature here on this telly documentation ... cant remember its name right now...

    1) If you don't think senders/sellers are at risk, you're obviously new here, so I'll forgive you for making such a naiive statement. But, in the meantime, go check out some of the seller forums, and see what kinds of steps they have to take involving a shipment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) Using a fake name IS EVERYONE'S concern, because it's a flag, among the first of many reasons. I'm not going to elaborate, go and spend some time reading the USPS Postal Inspector Intern thread before you type silly things like that. Further, it's extremely retarded. And again, go read that postal inspector thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3) As I've mentioned in a few other places, I don't consider myself an LE expert by any means. But just use your brain for a moment. How easy would it be if you ARE caught with shit in a package, opening at your house, to claim that a jealous ex lover, baby daddy, baby momma, or stoner neighbor used YOUR name to have shit sent to your house, to either set you up, or pick up while you're gone. Now, think for a moment, how hard it would be to explain why they would go through all the trouble of setting you up, to use a fake name and/or misspell your name by a few letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4) Regarding your last statements about linking to your username. Hopefully you've thoroughly read the how-to's around here, which it sounds like you haven't, because I'm pretty sure you won't find anywhere that instructs people to use their real name as their username(s) anywhere online.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5) Lastly, apparently you didn't catch wind that sellers don't care for buyers who are finalizing early, especially with the way it fluctuates. Perhaps you have sellers that like/or have asked you to do this. But I know my own sellers prefer the buyers to go along with the process, they hedge it, and finalize when the package it received, to secure at both ends.

    ie only when the postman is over zealous, or where its known a specific postal depot is definitely using OCR technology etc.

    These were my first mistakes originally. I would use a completely fake name and my letters would never arrive.
    <br/>

    I wouldn't even suggest using generic titles like "CURRENT RESIDENT"

    Your real name or variation (J. Doe or John D.) is a much better option

    Dam bro I wish I coulda given you guys some advice ahead of time. But honestly you should of read the forums or the Wiki before you got the shit sent to a fake name. Call it an expensive lesson and a learning experience. Dont make the same mistake twice and before you know it this will be far in the past and you will be high off some good dope delivered right to your door.  8)

    I get a random junk mail to previous tenants, but just because a piece of junk mail slips through once a month doesn't mean your 1/4 lb of pot won't get rerouted to that old tenant's new address.
