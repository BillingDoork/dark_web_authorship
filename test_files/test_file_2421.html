    Please please does anyone here know the status of 25c NBOMe in South Africa or know where I can find out. There is nothing on the internet at all about this chemical.

    Thanks

    I doubt there is any specific legislation regarding it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a gray area in most countries. It's probably not scheduled, but you don't want to be caught with it.

    Well here in the US its still legal but I know I sure wouldn't want to get caught with it on blotters. If I got caught with some the police would probably arrest me for possession of LSD and I would sit in jail for a couple months till they got the lab results back and realized its not LSD.
