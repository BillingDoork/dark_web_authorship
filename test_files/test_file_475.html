    I got a order from djabbar no problems at all. But I was wondering is it just by pure luck that the customs don't find gear in the mail or are top vendors like this really this good at packaging?

    Were you expecting customs to seize your order? This market wouldn't exist if customs were any good at their job..

    No I was confident in it turning up but was just wondering what the chance is and also wondering what the reality would be if they found something. Is it just a matter of playing dumb and denying knowing anything about it?

    Lol what are the chances? So many variables here dude, such as how stealth/vac sealed the product is, etc etc etc.

    What they do to you depends on what it is and the quantity. 2 grams of hash =/= 2 oz of tar.

    Just order from people with PROPER feedback, stay domestic if it worries you that much and take a break if the paranoia is too much. Lots of us have had no troubles from here. Yet.Â  ::)
