    My friend wants some Salvia and seeing as there's none available in the US I'm forced to order internationally. Can anyone give me any tips or success stories to get my psyched up for this, I've always avoided international orders just because of the risk associated with them despite having heard many good things from many users on here.

    Yeah man. You know that song from top gun? "fly into, the danger zone?" I listen to that on repeat the entire time. It pumps me up and makes me want to scream and threaten people. On the day of the delivery, I wear a muscle shirt and answer the door and scream "what the fuck do you want man." This all of course with the danger zone song on full blast. I believe any cops attempting to do a CD would see how much of a badass I am and call it off.

    Just my 2 cents. This has worked out for me so far.

    I'll give you my opinion.  Don't get salvia, it's not worth it.  In addition to that, almost everyone who does it says they'll never do it again once they sober back up.

    Salvia is some strong stuff. it has anti addictive properties.      It feels like you are a plant in a green house.

    Well Salvia isn't a controlled substance, so technically it wouldn't be illegal to import. It is illegal in most states now, but there is no Federal scheduling on it, so I doubt they would do anything about it. At the most, you might get a love letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I agree with others, Salvia is just not worth it. It's a hell of an experience alright, but not one I would care to repeat. I was so thankful to get out of that twisted, fucked up, cartoony world that was trying to trap me in. Go get some DMT, you'll enjoy it much more, and there are plenty of US vendors.

    Not because of risk of LE... because of risk of PTSD from smoking salvia.

    salvia is illegal in the US? i did not know that. i thought it was legal almost everywhere. i know you can get it here at head shops and corner stores. if it is illegal to import and posses in the US i wouldnt take the risk. its not worth it. theres a reason for its wide spread legality. its a shit high and theres no chance of addiction. most people do it once and then never want to touch it again.
    <br/>
    theres so many better psychs on SR thats worth the risk to order and actually give you a positive experience
