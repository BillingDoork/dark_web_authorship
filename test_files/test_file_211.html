    I recently read a thread on here of people encouraging very much to not use your real name.
    <br/>
    Although weeks of research on using this site said no such thing was suggested.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I used my real name on the last order I received, although it was delivered to a friends address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am now considering getting a PO box at the local UPS, because I cannot receive such things where I'm living and neither can any close friends that I trust enough to not take it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I get a PO box, is this any less risky than ordering to my own home? Do I need to get a fake ID to use a different name? But I also hear you need 2 forms of ID to get your mail at your private PO box...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just want to know if using a fake name is necessary, because up until now I totally thought it wasn't but ow i'm reading all over this forum that you should.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Advice? I'm probably only going to be buying small amount of things and only things that would fit in an envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks!

    its safer put it in ur name.. then add a person that can recieve mail in ur po box they will not ask for there id or even for them to be present..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just add a fake name.. a girl or boy say its ur bf or gf u get busted just say that its ur ex's shit and u dont talk anymore..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    dont say  that to the cops say that to ur lawyer ... if u get arrested dont say shit .. say i want a lawyer talking to them wont do anything but get u in trouble..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    its there job to prove u guilty
    <br/>
    <br/>
    its not your job to prove your innocence

    Hm... I could try that. It just really scared me when people were in that thread saying stuff like "Use a fake name, period" when I had totally assured my friend it'd be fine to use his own.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do PO boxes filter there mail any differently?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And that strategy you thought of sounded good at first, but i just pitched it to my father (nonchalantly of course) who has been a defense attorney for 25 years and he said that probably wouldn't fly too well.

    hey man ur taking a chance either way..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is just how i do it.. and idc how u do it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you want to use a fake name it doesnt matter cuz guess what..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    possesion is 9 10th of the law.. u get it shipped anywhere and they do a controlled buy or catch u with it ur fucked..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think my idea would work best to shift the blame before going to court.. your lawyer would be able to get you a better plea bargin when it comes down to it.. if thats the way u wanna take it.. (shit i wouldnt plea out i would take it to trial unless they offered me a deffered sentenced with probation for a year or something like that...)  it would be harder for the prosecuter to say .. HE KNOWINGLY HAD DRUGS SHIPPED AND ORDERED THEM TO HIS PO BOX.. your defence could be well yeah its my po box but its not my stuff i shared a po box look it up.. PROVE THAT I ORDERED IT AND KNEW WHAT WAS IN IT...  idk man
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THERE IS NO FULL PROOF WAY.. no matter..what ur taking a risk.. if ur scared go to church dude.. this is the best way to do it for myself because shipping to my house is out of the question... some people use the last tenet at the place ... idk man good lluck

    simply say that i have no idea where that person is i was dating said person and person had just moved in town..
    <br/>
    person needed a place to stay and i let person stay with me since we had started dating and we broke up now and have no idea where said person is... i have no idea whats in this package because i didnt order it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is just a idea..its what i do and what i would say. you guys will all prolly end up telling on ur self so it doesnt really matter..
    <br/>
    if you get cought SHUT UR MOUTH dont say shit.. just let them threaten u and get a lawyer or ur a jackass!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is all stuff you would tell your lawyer to use as a defense.. they only have what u tell them remember that..
    <br/>
    all they know is a package was dropped off in someone elses name into ur po box..
    <br/>
    from there its up to them to prove that YOU IN FACT ORDERED THE DRUGS AND YOU HAD KNOWLEDGE OF ITS CONTENTS ..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN PROVE THIS UNLESS THEY GET A HOLD OF YOUR LAPTOP..

    I opened up a PO Box today just for overseas deliverys. Because of a failed airsoft import ages ago, i thought i'd better not have that shit sent to me, i'm sure my mail would get extra scrutiny. At least with the PO addy, it wont ring any alarm bells.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Domestic i use my real name/ I only order small. Anyway i've made 3 orders now. 2 from overseas. I'm worried about the one from NL...but i'm guaranteed packaging is VERY stealthy so i went for it. Other one is from the UK which i'm very comfortable with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If all 3 arrive, its going to be a great xmas...beacause i hate xmas. ;D

    Yeah i read the vendors reviews from NL, and a happy buyer from Oz had a successful drop not long agao, so i thought his packaging must be good.
    <br/>
    Prices are too hard to ignore.

    I use a POB for all SR deliveries and have not had one issue yet. I personally wouldn't advise leave weed or something that can smell in the POB for days, go and pick it up when you are expecting it (if you can find a 24 hour post office, that would be best, you can pick you stuff up at 2am if you wanted.
