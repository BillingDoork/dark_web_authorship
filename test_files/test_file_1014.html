    I have recently gotten a note from the post office saying that a package was to big to fit in the mail box and i need to go to the post office and show my ID to receive my package.  Im pretty sure this package that they are talking about is 1 gram of MDMA.  I just don't get this at all, I have never heard of any postal service doing this for any reason at all.  Im just looking for some advice or what the postal office is trying to do here.. It  just doesnt make any sense any advice would be nice.
    <br/>

    Im not to worried about it, so should I just go to the post office and pick it up.  There is no way one gram of molly could not fit in the mail box.

    well, at worst case LE are involved and they found it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But i'd say 98% your good and you'll get the letter.

    <br/>

    though in fact, your chances are 50/50 :D

    so weigh it up, son.

    Honestly, I'd go get it. Or send someone else with actual plausible deniability to get it. If this is the UK (?) you can send a family member with ID and the card and they can collect it (I recommend your Mum/Grandma/Grandpa/Wife/Someone inconspicuous).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, it's unlikely it's anything suspect. It'd be too risky for them to do a controlled delivery at the post office, it'd mean them staking it out every day for the next 14-21 days, etc. And if the Popo aren't waiting there then you don't have to wait while the clerk says 'Hold on a sec, just calling the police.'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck!

    happened to me once too. packaging was too big. I was really pissed at the vendor, but that was some good bud he sent me, so left 4/5 after all:)
    <br/>
    Also, I didn't have to sign or show ID, just the note I got! (I'm from EU).

    Just go and get it, that is what a normal person would do when they get a card from the PO. Happens all the time in Aus. Your not admitting to anymore bay picking it up then you are by receiving it in your mail box. Remember by the time you actually get arrested, they already know everything they need to.
    <br/>
    Its better to pick it up then have it end up in dead letters and be opened...

    I'm in the U.S. and there was one vendor who'd send me packages bigger than my mailbox. The postman always left outside my front door in the hallway. Just sitting there.

    If it is domestic, go feel it out. You wont have to sign for a domestic package that is too big to fit assuming it was sent with no signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is international and didnt fit, you are gonna need to sign regardless, so be careful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People renting boxes always rent the littlest ones to save a buck or two and this happens alot. Not sure why they dont give themselves some wiggle room ( literally ) for packages of such a sensitive nature.
