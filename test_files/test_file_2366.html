    vacuum seal. x2 or x3.
    <br/>
    scrub the outside of the vac sealed bag with ammonia or bleach or at least alcohol swabs to get any drug residue scent off of it.
    <br/>
    wear new gloves after handling the drugs and sealing up the first vac seal. Wear new gloves at each step. Don't contaminate the outside of the package or any part with drug residue.
    <br/>
    Dont' smoke weed during packaging. Don't expose the package/envelope to MJ smoke.
    <br/>
    Don't worry about putting odor or cover smells in the package. It's not useful when a dog is bing used to detect drugs/cash. That will only fool humans who get overwhelmed by the more powerful scent in a mix of smelly things. Dogs just smell everything (drugs + the decoy/cover odor), and if you put the wrong thing in, it may ATTRACT the dog to your package.

    ^ Yes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Strong odors are actually a red flag on account of the fact lots of silly drug smugglers imagine various scents cover up the smell of weed/coke etc.
    <br/>

    You want to use vacuum packaging. There are a number of useful threads in this profile on this subject. Search for HDPP or LDPE and you'll find at least two of them with detailed instructions on how to do it right.

    Some people find the search function a bit counterintuitive, so here you go:

    Read all those threads. Then you have a good idea of what you need to do next.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Actually, every vendor should read those threads!
