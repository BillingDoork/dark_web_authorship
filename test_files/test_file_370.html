    Hey SR folks,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a quick query regarding escrow. I understand it is put to great use regarding scamming and non arrivals etc, but how would it work in the case of bunk product? If a vendor sent a sample for example of a substance that checked out fine, then you place a larger much more expensive order for said product that arrives but turns out to be complete bogus/fake product?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do you go about proving this, and does escrow help the buyer out in situations like these? What is SR supports view on this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thx

    i fortunately haven't had to deal with this, but i imagine it would depend on other users having similar issues, as well as vendor "rules" in their vendor page.

    I doubt the vendor will offer a refund of any sort, but SR admins might. It will depend on how many purchases you have made and your refund rate.
    <br/>
    Also, if many other customers are reporting low quality, you are likely to receive at least a partial refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm lucky that all of my purchases have exceeded my expectations except one order from drnarco which was never sent.
