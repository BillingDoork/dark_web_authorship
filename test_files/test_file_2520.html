    If they normally leave packages that are too big with the leasing office then they will do that.  Some apartments have larger mailboxes below the individual ones for bigger packages and you will get a key to open it in your mailbox.

    Should there be any concern if the package is left at the leasing office? Honest question as I haven't made my first purchase yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thought of a package of 7g of bud sitting in the leasing office with my name and apartment number on it makes me feel a little uneasy. I guess if the package wasn't raising any red flags when it went through the mail system, then I probably wouldn't have to worry about someone being suspicious of it in the leasing office... especially if I select a good vendor that packages well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?

    I always ask seller just in case, for my own sense of security as to the container they're sending the order in.  I tell them I prefer the USPS 'small flat rate box' which is almost identical to a VHS tape's length,width and height,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some vendors have also used the large flat rate envelope, and the post man typically slightly folds them so they fit in the mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should be OK in with either one I listed, but to make yourself feel safe I'd shoot the seller a PM with a small description in the subject.
