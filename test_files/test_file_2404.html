    Ok, so in a bizarre turn of events, I went to the post office to check my mail today. Ok, not bizarre, but what happened next is. I've been having trouble receiving some regular, non-illicit packages. Mind you I was just assigned this PO Box a couple weeks ago. When I inquired at the desk, the clerk informed me that I was assigned the wrong box, and promptly issued me a new box, with keys and what not. As far as the old box; which happened to be a combo lock(like a little safe), all he said was "yeah, just don't touch it anymore". I also have the name that is associated with the first box, and of course, the combo. Only possible problem would be getting my packages before he does. But everytime I checked that box, nothing was EVER in it. Now FYI, this is an FPO box, located outside of the CONUS, but it's a "US" address as far as shipping goes. My point there is this box belongs to someone who is most likely no longer assigned to this location, or is away for an extended period of time. Did I just get a free anonymous drop box?

    I wouldn't try using that box for anything. I may check it occasionally to see if anything that was suppose to go to you was sent there. At the end of the day though whatever ends up in it is not yours. The postal management may change locks, or send back whatever ends up in it. Just seems safer to pass this one by. That's my 2 Btc.

    Yeah, that thought crossed my mind as well. I waited a few business days later, and the combo I have still opened it, and of course nothing is inside. I'm not going to release all the details I have, but I think it's safe to say whoever's box this is, does not receive ANY mail in it. This box is open 24/7 also, so if I was planning on use it to receive something, I would just go check it at 2am or whatever.

    If it fits in a lettermail PO, don't worry, your package is hardly suspect.

    Send yourself some shit from your house to the PO box and test it out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use different names ETC and see if anything gets there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe the real owner just beats you there for the mail everday. you never know. Test it out.

    I have already received numerous pieces of mail here. Like I said, they "assigned" me this box by accident, and I checked it daily, almost immediately after mail is delivered daily at 11am. None of my mail that I was expecting has ever come up missing, and I've only "intercepted" one piece of mail that belonged to the actual owner. Your idea(that they pick it up before I check) was my first thought also, but I wasn't considering the fact that I have been checking it daily, around 11am, when the "owner" is at work, for 40 plus days. I have a piece of mail coming to this address, so I will be finding out very soon if this is gonna work. I really don't see why it wouldn't, though. I know for a fact they aren't changing the combo. Only possible way I could lose out is if somehow they decide to check their box coincidentally on the day I'm expecting my delivery. Will update.

    Don't do it. That box is going to eventually be assigned to a new person, and you run the risk of the mail being returned to sender or forwarded on to the person who's name was on that box.

    Not necessarily. Anyhow, it's still a USPS post office, with a US address. In my opinion, much safer than shipping international. Really no difference at all between this and domestic USPS, just takes a day or two longer to receive.
