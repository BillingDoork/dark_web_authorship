    Is it normal for a vendor to take a couple days to get to your order? I know that I am a noob, when it comes to this community. But I really do want to gain the best experience possible. I would love to start doing business with some of these great vendors out there that I have been reading about and hearing such good things. I have ordered 2 things One vendor responded quite fast the other I have yet to hear from and its coming up on a week?

    Thanks for your input! Greatly appreciate it!

    They have 4 days before the cancel options becomes available.  They can no longer see your address after they mark it in transit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if you ordered Friday and they still haven't marked it in transit yet then I think today is a holiday and usps is closed so it probably wouldn't go out until tomorrow.

    You are correct, today is a postal holiday and the next available day to mail is Tuesday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I checked and sent everyone who ordered from me this weekend a note to let them know. It is always good to keep your customers informed as to what is up and when they can expect their package ;)
