    was supposed to receive 1/2 oz of og kush instead i get a empty flat bubble mailer that had been clearly ripped open in the back and then pressed back together to seal it so now the dcn says delivered b/c the envelope itself did make it just no product this is fucked up as hell thanks usps for fucking me out of a refund the fucked thing is i had an order come from the same vendor no problems like 1.5 weeks ago and he is a reputable vendor so hopefully he can work something out i really doubt mrhumboldt would send out an empty package that had been sealed opened then re-sealed

    That's good of mrhumbolt to do that, we would have done that as well, &amp; I'm sure there are a number of other reputable vendors that would have done the same once you provided them with a new address.  It does seem a little silly for someone to tear it apart &amp; then sort of put it back together &amp; send it on or make sure it got delivered that way . . .  It would make more sense to not allow it to be delivered . . .

    I have known 50-60 year old stoners!  They would hit on the 20 somethings at my favorite bar.  Not cool.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or maybe the mailman is a do gooder who likes to take matters into his own hands.  When his higher up told him to deliver the package because they didn't have an inspector available he said to himself: "No, way, I will be sure no one gets high using the US postal service" and ripped open the package, took the stash and tossed it in a toilet.

    I guess the vender should have used a vacuum sealer for one as some have said but yeah seems like some sneaky prick of a postmans had it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Possibly smelt the weed from the package?

    Look at it this way they wont get in trouble will they what are you going to say "that postman stole my weed" considering its illegal probably just laugh in your face :/

    yeah 100 if the vendor doesnt vac seal that is not what you call stealth packing. All i know is if he is going to reship a quart id make sure you ask him to vac seals it as he should! and have it sent to diff addy

    good luck
