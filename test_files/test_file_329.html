    Is that sketchy? I just ordered something and put the previous tenant's name down, who still gets junk mail, but on my apartment mailboxes, it says the last name of my and my roommate. So I'm pretty sure I made a bad call. Can I just put my address without a name?

    You're on a website buying illegal narcotics that are being sent to your physical address, that you will open and consume with your mates. I'd be more worried about the fact that you made a decision that could send you to prison THEN came onto the forum to question that question. Reap what you sow.

    Isn't there a video in the "postal hacking" thread (sticky'd?) that shows them sending mail with only addresses, only zip codes, etc. with no problems? Personally, I receive stuff all the time for previous tenants or what not, so in my opinion, the whole " if it isn't your name you will never receive it" business is malarky. Perhaps if you have an overzealous postman who tries to cut down on your junk mail count, but in my experience, if it has that address on it, that's where it's going. I can't tell you how many times I've received legit packages at addresses where I was at on business, temporarily, etc.; That I have never received mail at before.

    there are numerous occasions where using the previous tenants names has resulted in orders not arriving, just read some of these threads about people having delivery issues. a large portion were using old occupants names
    <br/>
    <br/>
    even after the 18 months of mail forwarding, they are still supposed to return to sender. if you receive important mail with tracking or delivery confirmation then you are lucky, but this is in general very risky
    <br/>
    <br/>
    plus it is mail fraud, an additional felony if you accept the package, open it and are then caught somehow. as well as just a dick move to possibly get someone else in severe trouble. if you want to order drugs then at least have the balls and take responsibility for it rather than frame someone else imo
