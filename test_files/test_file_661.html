    Vendors ship via USPS compared to other private mail services because the government agency requires warrants to search articles of mail (and because it's the SR standard).  At this point, however, I'm starting to think I would rather have vendors use private companies or offer private shipping as an option.  If the vendor's methods were up to date (mbb's etc, not vacuum sealing in my opinion), I would rather use UPS or Fedex.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can only assume way faster shipping and I don't think it would be much less safe.  I've lost too many packages (more than 0) and waited far too long to keep much faith in USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Opinions?

    Regardless,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor's will keep using usps for the most part.   Simply because it is working for the most part,  and the warrant issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have yet to lose anything,  I guess it all depends on the vendor,  i know some have 100% delivery rates.

    If a dog alerts to your package and it's USPS, then they get a warrant easy as fuck. If they just wanna search your shit on a hunch, that's not good enough to get a warrant.

    <br/>
    UPS or FedEx can open your shit on the smallest hunch. But they're not likely to. They're just tryna get you your shit fuckin ASAP

    I am not.  I have been using SR successfully for over a year.  USPS is the standard here, but it's not great.  The warrant issue is easy to bypass, so what other pros does USPS have over the others?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Serious question.  Don't deny it because it's not the standard.

    GetYourFix: That was rude.  I believe he intended honest debate. I've seen him here for a long time and in fact, he's been here significantly longer than you.  Look at your user numbers.  His is 11989, while yours is 33581.  3x the number his is.
    <br/>

    (edit) To put this in perspective, he's been here over 11 months, you've been here for 4.(/edit)

    Then look at his post count and content.  If he was LE he would probably have posted a LOT more.  I haven't gone back and checked his post content, but I don't remember seeing anything that flagged my attention before.  Also, I've found that a lot of people with a low post count(especialy those that have been here for a while) seem MORE intelligent than those with a high post count.  For starters they don't have something to prove.  Secondly they generally don't jump in and call other people names or act in a derogitory manner without adding to the conversation in the slightest way.  Third, They usually haven't posted large amounts of identifying information on the PUBLIC forums.  Fourth, They've generally gathered a rather good unbiased view of circumstances or situations because they've read MANY other peoples views without getting in arguments and emotionally attached to opinions on the matter being discussed.

    Yep, that's me. I don't know the actual numbers, but I do know that everything USPS actually ends up getting transported by UPS. USPS is UPS's biggest customer. That being said, if you have proper stealth and sealing techniques, you should have no problems with USPS. So use the online Click N' Ship or APC with a prepaid credit card, and you should be fine. As for me, I know where post offices are that have no video surveillance, so I have no qualms about using those. I just don't like to wait in line, but I digress.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For non USPS carriers, FedEx will be better than UPS in my opinion, but that's because they're a bit more lax on security. But you shouldn't be concerned about security because you have awesome stealth, right?! That's what I thought... ;)

    Thanks weirdal, it was an honest question.  Never mistake a low post count as being someone new; my buyer stats are higher than gyf's vendor stats lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I didn't know USPS used UPS; that's interesting.  So, in my mind, using UPS (or other) is probably about as likely to get caught as using USPS.  I'm just trying to get faster and more reliable service (to put in perspective, I'm mainly a bulk buyer).  The more I think about it, I just can't understand why USPS is the standard besides the warrant issue.  But thanks for the input USPS Expert lol.  and others of course :)

    Haha, no problem. For now, as a buyer, the best thing you can do is buy from US vendors that have posted that prices have increased due to USPS rates, or otherwise mentioned something about the changes, either in their profile or listing. Or simply contact your vendor and ask if they're aware of the changes. Vendors, start using prepaid cc with an online account using Click N Ship or use the APC if your post office has one. Or just suck it up and take it to the counter. Just make sure your stealth is good, and you want get caught. Simple as that.

    For starters, the odds of you not getting your orders because the vendor used USPS is highly unlikely an issue of it being sent USPS.  More than likely it was either the vendor didn't send it, you didn't use your real name or packaging was poor enough so it got jacked.  USPS has a fucking awesome track record!  How often do your bills not show up!  Providing you are using you correct name that goes on all your other bills (which may have something to do with you not receiving them). . .We're talking 1/5000 not being delivered when proper name &amp; address are attached!  (We do a superb job of packaging)   The USPS is by far cheaper when it comes to expedited shipping, up to 4x!  &amp; as of yet, you are not required to show ID to mail something as opposed to other carriers.

    I can't understand those people promoting using ups or fedex. In order to send that way you have to fill in your information on their computers. What's the advantage in doing that? Again, no anonymity. I suppose you could use fake name/address, but you're still inside their building with cameras pointing right at you at the same time that you're inputting all that info and so they could track you to the package(s) you send. &gt;&gt;No good.

    @NCK I must just be experiencing the 1/5000 odd lol.  No, actually I haven't had many order lost in the grand scheme of things, only a few throughout my SR usage.  I definitely understand what you're saying, but I'm thinking on the me-send-an-occasional-package side of things, rather than the volume-dealing vendor side.  I see how people are more interested in the big picture, and that makes sense for these forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @goblin In my town, there are UPS dropboxes.  I assumed you could set up shipment online with fake info with prepaid cc, like one of the methods for buying shipping with tracking from USPS after the updates, I believe.

    I was going to respond with a long detailed response to your queries, but I will just sum it up with I have been here as a buyer for much longer than 11months and have well over 100 transactions with enough money spent to be embarrassing. Have you thought that maybe I MIGHT have an account to buy with separate from my vendor acount as to not reveal my general location to the public.. You go home as well. It's past your bed time.

It's ridiculous to even fathom the consequences if we all just started switching to FedEx or UPS. You need to do your research before you try to "school" me, you fucking idiot.

    Nobody is spreading any misinformation. just questioning procedures and making sure we're still making the right decisions.  What's the problem with that?  Negative attitudes and blind witch hunting is why I don't post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So let me ask this: if, because of the USPS changes, shipping anonymously for both sender and receiver via USPS with tracking is impossible, then would you consider private companies as an option if there was a way to do it anonymously?
    <br/>

    I don't get why people are so stuck on one method.  I'm not spreading misinformation, just questioning everything.

    Pretty sure its already in there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, just because a package is shipped somewhere or to someone doesn't mean anything.  They cant really prove it was that person who requested or received the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Correct. USPS only does random audits with either drug dogs or x-ray machines, but that's because they use UPS for their shipments as I'd previously mentioned. UPS uses drug dogs, and uses them more often—not every day, but definitely on most days. That's why it's important to keep your stealth and sealing game very tight. Naturally, shipping via UPS or FedEx 100% anonymously is not really possible either. That's why I suggest just keeping the payment method anonymous (cash) and use a quality disguise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only potential problem I see with using an online account is that, yes, customers' addresses will likely be stored in a database somewhere and tied to that vendor's account, and if a package ever does get intercepted and found out to be illicit substances, all addresses tied to that account could start to be monitored. That's not necessarily good for buyers. That's why I think just sucking it up and going to the counter with a quality disguise, or simply using the APC with a variety of different prepaid cards over time will be the best approach, for both the vendor and the buyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors realize there is some risk to this game and that there will always be at least some battle to wage against those who engage in the WOD. I say, just be thankful that resources like SR even exist and make it much less of a risk than street dealings, and then go about your business and stop complaining. :)

    Look, hyperocity, I don't mean to step all over you, but are you serious? You think most people are going to have the balls to put on a big ole floppy hat and a wig, or a beard and mustache, and kooky glasses to try to disguise themselves? Most people (myself definitely included) would be much too self-conscious, and very, very nervous, and undoubtedly would give themselves away or act so ackward they might just as well be giving themselves away. That's not for everybody, like at all.

    I'll give you this much, yes it is a risky business, and so we have to try to minimize those risks; that's why I have decided to forget about tracking from now on. I'll just have to trust the carrier to deliver, and the buyer not to scam me, at least for amounts that I could conceivably live with if I were to lose it. For much higher amounts of money (for larger quantities), I guess the only option left is FE. Even then there might be a chance that a reship would be in order, but at least it won't be a total loss.

    To each his own, but seriously, I have waaaay better disguise methods in my stealth guide. Also, it is important to not be nervous. If you can't overcome nervousness with an encounter with a clerk, you definitely don't want to stroll up to the counter. I don't think most people would be all that nervous though. The likelihood of getting caught is still quite slim, even with a counter... encounter. :)

    I don't think you understood my question.  What happens when LE orders from you?  There are DEFINITELY LE ordering from US Domestic Vendors and when they receive the package they can determine it's exact point and date of origination in the facility.  This means they can go back and check the cameras.  In addition to that, when you drop off your mail at the counter you're bound to get fingerprints on it.  I don't care how many additional hands it goes through, if one of the vendor's prints is still on the package when it arrives, they're fucked.  There's NO reason why their prints would have an excuse to be on the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think the APC might be a better option if it weren't for the fact that there's a closer camera that can get a better image of the person in question.  I agree that it wouldn't be difficult to cover the camera, however, if it's recording at all times, how do you know how big the angle of view is? what if you covered the camera before stepping directly in front of it, but it caught an image peripherally before you covered it.  Also, can you purchase tracking at an APC for a first class package?
    <br/>

    Thanks!

    well, I've heard of some of their issues, but I don't think they're going out of business.  The federal government has decided that the USPS branch of the organization needs to fund their pension program(one of the most robust in the nation) out 10 years in advance and they gave them very little time to do it.  This is in addition to several other restrictions or rather burdens placed upon them that no other government agency has to bear.  :/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sorry I don't remember specifics right now.. :/  Bottom line, I don't think the federal gvmt would make ridiculous demands and then cut the program when the requirements set aren't met.  I dunno, it IS the American government..

    For those of you concerned about your face on a camera, you can always take the time to construct a infra-red LED hat.  Search it out on the surface web.  Pretty easy to do, involves a 9 volt battery, some wires, and some infra-red LEDs near your face on the underside of the hat.  Makes your face look like a glowing ball of light to a camera, but not visible to the human eye.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the rest of yourself, change your outfit every time you go, and to make it even harder to track you, use different facilities.  IE don't follow a pattern.

    Also, I realize there are many valid reasons for not ordering to your residence, but some people are needlessly fearful of this option.  What is your reasoning for this?  I will say for the record that I believe the buyer's guide specifically states not to order to a location with drugs already on-site.

    Not true. Canine units do not randomly show up, neither do they have a set schedule at either FedEx or UPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a package seems suspicious, one of two things will happen:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Handler, or whomever, will report it to a Ramp Agent.
    <br/>
    2. Not shit, because there are a lot of "suspicious" packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take note that unless someone can readily identify (by smelling or seeing) a package as contraband, there is not much that the police or any one else can do.

       GetYourFix: That was rude.  I believe he intended honest debate. I've seen him here for a long time and in fact, he's been here significantly longer than you.  Look at your user numbers.  His is 11989, while yours is 33581.  3x the number his is.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       (edit) To put this in perspective, he's been here over 11 months, you've been here for 4.(/edit)
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Then look at his post count and content.  If he was LE he would probably have posted a LOT more.  I haven't gone back and checked his post content, but I don't remember seeing anything that flagged my attention before.  Also, I've found that a lot of people with a low post count(especialy those that have been here for a while) seem MORE intelligent than those with a high post count.  For starters they don't have something to prove.  Secondly they generally don't jump in and call other people names or act in a derogitory manner without adding to the conversation in the slightest way.  Third, They usually haven't posted large amounts of identifying information on the PUBLIC forums.  Fourth, They've generally gathered a rather good unbiased view of circumstances or situations because they've read MANY other peoples views without getting in arguments and emotionally attached to opinions on the matter being discussed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So, after all this what makes you qualified to act this way?  Because you have a higher post count?  Because you're too immature to be respectful? Because you sell drugs?

      I was going to respond with a long detailed response to your queries, but I will just sum it up with I have been here as a buyer for much longer than 11months and have well over 100 transactions with enough money spent to be embarrassing. Have you thought that maybe I MIGHT have an account to buy with separate from my vendor acount as to not reveal my general location to the public.. You go home as well. It's past your bed time.

      Ps I don't give a fuck at this point if I sound "rude" (wwwaaaaahhhhh). Secondly, you are spreading information that is dangeroug to the community at large. It's ridiculous to even fathom the consequences if we all just started switching to FedEx or UPS. You need to do your research before you try to "school" me, you fucking idiot.

    Sorry man, I would've responded sooner, but I didn't see your post calling me out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alright, you can continue to be derogatory and NOT contribute to conversation if you'd like, but feel free to pm me with it instead of clogging up space in threads where people ARE out of high school.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In case you weren't aware, there aren't professors in high school, those are generally found in college.  Maybe it'd be best if you stuck to things you knew about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take a look at your karma man, it's not just me who see's behind your juvenile handle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Correcting spelling and grammar?  I was just pointing out that we have a wonderful function known as spell check built into the software we use for this forum.  I'm not correcting your spelling, I'm pointing out your incompetence to use such a simple tool.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry if this post is kinda harsh.  I deleted half of it, and changed half of what remained in attempts to stay civil.  I think I managed to post without actually putting into words what I think of your intelligence; However, I'd think twice before I posted again if I were you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you keep your mouth shut people might THINK you're a fool, but why open your mouth and remove all doubt?

     For those of you concerned about your face on a camera, you can always take the time to construct a infra-red LED hat.  Search it out on the surface web.  Pretty easy to do, involves a 9 volt battery, some wires, and some infra-red LEDs near your face on the underside of the hat.  Makes your face look like a glowing ball of light to a camera, but not visible to the human eye.

    I think if it were a 'high quality' beard it would be worth while, but most cameras these days have IR filters so this would be a useless gadget except for drawing attention to yourself.  First you've got LEDs in your hat, second it will show a small glow around the LEDs but not obscure your face, just draw attention to you.

    I personally never use USPS, I prefer UPS. Dogs arent an issue for me because in the past I've only mailed xanax, klonopin and rohypnol (all benzos), so to me my biggest worry is when the USPS asks me for ID when I mail the package (UPS never asks me for ID)
