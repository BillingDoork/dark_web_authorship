    In the process of looking into tracking data for a purchaser, I learned one of my tracking numbers was being shown "return to sender." Bizarre, I copy and paste everything. Not knowing whose number it belonged to I just presumed I should wait, because that buyer should contact me to sort out what happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today all of my orders were finalized. I checked my feedback to see if possibly there was something to help explain whose package had been marked "return to sender." I checked tracking thinking perhaps it had been figured out by the post - no, it’s now halfway to its original departure location. I saw one of my earlier orders had changed feedback from a 5 to a 4, and did a 360 to what they had initially written. I checked the transaction, and the dates match up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if a more experienced user could shed some light on exactly what I'm not getting.

    It happened to me, nothing has happened yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sure it either got sent back to the fake address I put on or just thrown in a box somewhere, but I'm sure my stealth has saved me for the most part. That is our best defense

    I dont have experience as a vendor but the buyers actions seem very strange to me.  So you have no pm's from this buyer stating his package didn't arrive or has he mentioned this in the updated feedback at all?  If he's just changed feedback and not mentioned the no show I'm thinking he's either a first time buyer with no idea what to do or less likely a legit buyer with RL issues preventing him getting in touch.  Package could be anywhere.

    Looking at it again, the return to sender tracking is the only number that could belong to this user.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    His review, both before the change and after, make it clear as day that he received the product. He even states in both the before and after that he regent tested the drug.
    <br/>

    Ugh. I just realized what it probably is :(.  Its the cheapest item I offer.

    Maybe the buyer received the package and removed the product, then marked it "return to sender" and threw it back in the mail with the idea that this would distance him from the illegal activity...

    No. I'm 100% sure it was a shill account from another friendly MDMA vendor.
