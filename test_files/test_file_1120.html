    Hello all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recieved a package at a drop recently from Cali in a small flat rate box. The product was adequately vac sealed and inside an mbb. That was all that was in the box. When my drop opened the box the package was wide open. It was a hot day and it appears the glue got hot and popped open....or the post opened it and then tried closing the lid back hoping the glue would restock.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How worried should I and my drop be?

    Caution is called for IMO however.......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is unlikely that any LE would let that happen if they intended to CD or whatever. They are very aware of the fact that we are already paranoid and so anything out of the ordinary may tip us off.  Same goes with odd traking info... it stands to reason that they would try be as invisible in the process as possible cause they know we will be checking our awesome drug delivery every 5 mins cause we are excited and so it goes back to not wanting to tip us off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I cannot recall a CD that I have heard of that the  victim has had any indication it was coming.  Its always just a routine pickup and from the shadows they slink out and reveal themselves and that they have been stalking you for whatever time frame...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Caution is warranted but keep perspective too. Maybe the drop should mark as not at this address or whatever and leave it on top of the fridge for a month or so? just for peace of mind...
