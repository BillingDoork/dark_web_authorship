    Hi
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have received a note from parcelforce saying they have my package and have dropped it off at the local PO for collection. Could this be dodgy?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If customs had found anything would they let it carry on it's way?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If i go in to the PO to collect it whats the worst that could happen? I mean they are not going to have police there but obviously would have cameras.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sick

    Did they try to deliver it? Is it a package not able to fit through the letterbox?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If so its common for people to have to pick up stuff from the local PO who have a small dept in some areas separate from the PO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be safe I'd clean house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd collect or try. Either way if it has been compromised then best to find out sooner than later when you may have a visit off the police and/or customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Depends how much we are talking about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best to pick it up really.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could always say you thought it was something else if you got jumped on outside by the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So clean up house and ALL links between you and the actual transaction.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.
