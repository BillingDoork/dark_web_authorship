    I shipped out 10 percs to a buyer and as a new vendor I have no idea how to view buyer stats or maybe he just was a new buyer. Anyways I use a certain stealth technique and he messages me saying that I basically scammed him. After explaining to him where to find the items he then says I shorted him 5 pills. I'm very precise when it comes to drugs and money and making sure customers get what they order. Anyways he's refusing to finalize unless I send him another 5 pills. What should I do? I don't want to get a bad review but I know 110% I packaged 10 pills and also the buyer admitted to dumping the contents of the package in the trash because he thought I had scammed him and all that stuff in the package was just bullshit. This is really frustating. I feel like I'm being blackmailed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can someone please explain to me how to view a buyers stats and if you cannot view the stats does that mean they are a new buyer?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If any experienced vendors can chime in here with helpful advice I would be very grateful.

    If he admitted via message to throwing part of the packaging away then you will have a good case to resolve this via the resolution center.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, as I'm not a seller, someone else will have to tell you how to view buyer stats... Sorry.

    If he threw part of the package away its probable where the 5 pills were.. KEEP THAT MESSAGE FOR RESOLUTION CENTER.. He could be just trying to get 5 more pills out of you or he truly may have been dumb enough to miss them..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Out of close to 100 packs iv got, not to mention not just from SR, I swear anytime im expecting something, the whole parcel sent gets torn to shreds til i find my goods, which normally is never too hard, some have been very crafty but not to the point where its obvious if u keep looking u will find your goods..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv had vendors iv bought from claim their buyers have had to msg and ask where it is, Then i get the package, and think to myself " are they saying this so buyers feel fsafe?" or are the buyers just that dumb and just give up after thinking its gonna be n plain sight like legal shit..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would love for a vendor to 1 time send me a parcel where i took longer than 2 min to find the goods..lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    with that being said,, since u also mention u dont know how to look at buyer stats? means to me your new.. This could be a older buyer like myself and decided he was gonna try to get xtra 5 more out of you cause your new and u dont wanna to go to resolution either a buyer thats been hereÂ  good while with great stats VS a vendor who is new, with hardly no rep.. he probable feels its a win win for him either way. Iv seen many assholes do that.. cause they are gonna give him 50% back more than likely, or im sure he is hoping u will just send another 5 to kill the situation..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thats how ppl do around here.. Gotta watch who u fuck with bro..
