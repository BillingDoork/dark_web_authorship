    I'd download an offline client and send the coins to this intermediary wallet first.
    <br/>
    At least this way there's no direct link between your localbitcoins account and SR.
    <br/>
    I noticed in another thread that you're vending as well so I wouldn't skip this step as it really doesn't take a lot of work.
    <br/>
    An offline wallet is also a safer place to store your coins than some random website.

    Thanks Duff,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah I am just in first month,
    <br/>
    I use this for buying and try and keep everything separate..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there a particular offline wallet you could recommend?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers

    I can definitely recommend Electrum for its ease of use and it has a portable version as well. :)
    <br/>
    You'll also be given a random sentence called a seed when you first create your wallet.
    <br/>
    Write down or backup this sentence somewhere safely as you'll be able to use it to restore your wallet should you ever lose it.

    It's not a DIRECT link, but it's still a link. The method you described only puts an indirection between the exchange and SR. A mixing service like blockchain.info's "shared send" or bitcoin fog would completely break this chain.

    This is true, the safest client for a completely offline "long-term" storage is Armory. CLEARNET: https://bitcoinarmory.com/
