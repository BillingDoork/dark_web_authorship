    Hi
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a question regarding shipping.  When packages are sent from a company, would sending them as gifts not seem weird/get them flagged. Would sending them as commercial samples seem more appropriate?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if this is done would more then one sample per address raise flags? Thanks
    <br/>

    Do you mean with a customs label on saying gift?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Having several free samples sent to your address once is not suspicious IMO. Having the same parcel arrive every week, maybe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you read threads by postal workers they are not really looking that hard at your mail. The only real thing to flag your mail as suspicious is smell, poor wrapping and bad addresses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Better to be safe than sorry though... mix and match, find an anonymous drop address. Not worth getting caught is it?

    Yup I mean the custom label
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I work for a company that sends out several packages daily and orders are tossed in along with the mail
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I choose commercial sample because, I feel at least, it would seem odd for a company to be sending an individual a gift.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course the product being sent out is constantly changing, etc etc. But still, I have had requests for the customs declaration to say gift instead of commercial sample. I just feel that a gift coming from a company may raise some flags.

    Ah you're a vendor...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I receive packages from China/Thailand all the time, ebay ones, that have 'gift' on the customs form. Never had a problem with them, even though  they have been commercial goods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can't say anymore than that really :)
