    hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a few weeks ago i received a business letter from a sr vendor. it was open but this is not the reason for this thread (the glue just sucked and my vendor promised to improve this).
    <br/>
    it was a domestic order which took very long (within germany more than 1 week).
    <br/>
    the strange thing was that the postal stamp was not normally stamped by their stamps they use. on the postal stamp was just a loop that looked like the 'aids loop' (written by a ball pen). don't know the correct english word for it but i think you know what i mean.
    <br/>
    call me paranoid but since this i'm a bit frightened of ordering at sr.
    <br/>
    is here anybody who knows what that means? maybe the post forgot to stamp it, the postman saw it and 'stamped' it in his way... but i'm not sure at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ps: there was no tracking and no signing required.

    Can't speak for Germany specifically, but in UK it is normal to cancel a stamp with a pen, especially if the post office is small or the machine misses it. It isn't that common, due to volume of mail and time/effort needed to re-use a stamp it wouldn't be worth doing for every letter, but sometimes an extra vigilant postie will see one no checked and do it themselves. Speaks well for your vendor that a postie paid extra attention to the letter, besides reading the address, and decided the stamp was the biggest issue. Hope this helps,
    <br/>
