    Hey guy!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm gonna purchase a couple of LSD blotters through SR (to a region in the middle east) I'm just wondering about couple of things regarding safety issues and precaution !
    <br/>
    Should i use my own business address which is located inside a huge building with many different business mailboxes to receive my LSD envelopes [I can also ask my employees  to pick up the mail ] ? Do you think i can do that and maintain my identity secret using just the business address ? I would also like to know whats the maximum of blotters you guys think can be delivered through a single envelope , Is it safer than ordering other drugs in general ? have you ever heard about acid shipments interception ? and would you suggest finding different pickup spots for the envelopes (like friends houses\neighboures on vacation whatever%$) any advice on the subject of LSD SHIPMENTS will be helpful to me  8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    cheers hail satan !!!

    LSD has to be one of the easiest items to ship. How many blotters to an envelope? Well if the blotters are the size they used to be in the 80's/90's then I'd say you could fit 500-100 in a 24x12 business envelope. As for sending it to your business address... if your business is in anyway linked to your name, and the letter gets intercepted then they're going to think you ordered it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no idea about customs/police where you live but you really want to be finding an anonymous drop for your mail.  Friends/family/neighbours are still risky.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my opinion, shipping to your business is as dangerous as shipping to your home address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, in my country, if I were to be caught with a few blotter of acid &lt;10, then I wouldn't be in too much trouble. A slapped wrist probably. 500 tabs would get me a conspiracy to deal rap more than likely.

    Hope that helped some?

    If you own a business with multiple employees then that's a good cover but damn if you get caught in most middle eastern countries then you are fucked.
