    How to successfully import from China to USA by BBHC52
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This guide will not only cover how to import with a high success rate but it will also show you how to keep everyone out of jail if FBI is playing dress up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you follow my guide word for word your success should be very high, and your risk will be much much lower.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Importing can be very simple but that will not give you the results you may be seeking.
    <br/>
    This guide may work for other countries, however I have the most experience with USA from China so that will be my focus of this mini guide.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You may think "I just need to give my supplier the address that's it, importing is easy." however, these assumptions are wrong to import on a larger scale with higher success.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The most important thing is preparation.
    <br/>
    So lets start with your drop shipping address, this is crucial! Your drop shipping addresses are the most important thing.
    <br/>
    How to obtain your drop shipping addresses, this is a bit tricky and requires not only money and time but also a little social engineering skills.
    <br/>
    This is a little out of place but you will understand it once you read the whole guide. You will tell your driver to have his driver to have people he knows to ship packages to.
    <br/>
    You must explain to your driver the requirements so he can pass it a long and tell your driver that you will pay each address $100 per box that gets delivered and that you will
    <br/>
    pay your driver $25, and also give his driver $25 extra per box that comes in.
    <br/>
    If this doesn't work for you be creative and find a different method to obtain your drop shipping addresses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here are a few requirements for your drop shipping addy's
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) The person your shipping to should have a clean record
    <br/>
    2) The person your shipping to should have his name on the mortgage or utility bill
    <br/>
    3) The phone number that matches the address should have the persons name linked to it and it must not be a prepaid phone
    <br/>
    4) The person your shipping to should have never done importing in the past and if they have it should be a maximum of 1-2 times
    <br/>
    and should of never had anything in customs for longer than a day and the mos recent time of importing must of been over a month ago at the earliest.
    <br/>
    5) The person your shipping to should know not to ever open a package and that if a package is ever opened not only do they not get paid but they will not
    <br/>
    receive anymore packages from this point out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These are your basics for your drop shipping addresses and should be the first step to importing.
    <br/>
    Lets move on to the second step of preparations.
    <br/>
    Hire a driver, the driver should be someone you trust and is close to you. He has a tedious job and should be paid well.
    <br/>
    Requirements for your driver
    <br/>
    1) Must follow instructions undoubtedly
    <br/>
    2) Must be punctual
    <br/>
    3) Must be a smooth talker
    <br/>
    4) Must have a valid Driver's License
    <br/>
    5) Must have a decent inconspicuous car (not older than 3 years)
    <br/>
    6) Must have valid tags and a clean record (no criminal or traffic violations on his/her record)
    <br/>
    7) Must be able to make himself available whenever needed
    <br/>
    8) Must be a good talker and good with face to face interactions
    <br/>
    9) Must have a close friend that meets requirements from 1-8 and he must not know who you are at all
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now that we have our drop shipping shipping addresses and our driver and your drivers driver lets move onto the next step of preperation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This step may sound a bit confusing but I am here to help if you guys have any questions.
    <br/>
    You must purchase pre-paid cell phones, the one's I sell works great as the identification numbers aren't real as they are China copy's
    <br/>
    making it really hard for anyone to trace this phone to any individual. I would recommend activating these with T-Mobile pre-paid plans under the name "pre-paid customer, Joe Schmoe, John Doe, or Similar".
    <br/>
    Give a few of these to your driver and keep two for yourself but only use one and only share your number with your driver! Your driver should keep one and give one the rest to his driver, his driver
    <br/>
    should pass these out to all of the drop shipping addresses. You want to register the phones to different states at random so the area codes are all
    <br/>
    different. Now you need to make it very clear to your driver the purpose of these phone's. This is what will save everyone's ass if shit hit's the fan.
    <br/>
    Okay so here it is
    <br/>
    You want to have your driver pass the message down the chain of command.
    <br/>
    The drop shipping addresses should text your drivers, driver exactly 20 minutes after the package arrives with a secret phrase or word that will notify he has the package.
    <br/>
    The driver's, driver should text the driver right away with a secret phrase to notify him that the package has arrived. He should then text you once all have been delivered to tell
    <br/>
    you all went well.
    <br/>
    Now in case things have not gone well, since we are well prepared we have a back up of course :)
    <br/>
    Now since all of the tracking numbers(TN's) will be moved down the chain of command all the way from you to the address where it is being delivered your driver can always check the tracking
    <br/>
    to see if it has updated to say "delivered" (Note you should always use anonymity when tracking packages, always use VPN's, Clear cookie's/cashe, Always use a drop laptop one that can be thrown
    <br/>
    away if needed and ALWAYS use a public network like McDonald's or similar) Now if it has updated and no text was given to notify your drivers, driver you know something went wrong(FBI/DEA playing dress up more than likely)
    <br/>
    So if you remember far enough back we have saved an extra phone that we never used. We are going to get something to hide our voice, so it cannot be traced back to us. Now you must go down your chain of command very quickly
    <br/>
    you need to tell your driver you need the persons phone number who never sent the special phrase. We want to call his real number not his drop phone. Now we call it using any device that can change our voice (even computer
    <br/>
    programs like fruityloops will work just fine, you know the electronic computerized voices where you type what you want it to say)
    <br/>
    Now this is the voice mail we leave on the persons phone, something along these lines, please be original if your not it will fail quickly. Keep in mind if your drop shipping address broke the rule about opening the box this
    <br/>
    method will not work. Anyways here it is "Hello Mr. _______, I know you don't know who we are but we sent a package to your house today, it is a very important package for us. If you open this package or refuse to give us this package your dead.
    <br/>
    Leave the package at ________ at 5:35pm exactly if you want to live, and you better be alone"
    <br/>
    After that you want to wipe any prints you may have left on that phone inside and out, take the battery out, smash it in pieces, and toss it in a dumpster that doesn't have camera's around it.
    <br/>
    Now the drop shipping guy should be out on bail by now, he should firstly contact his lawyer, play the vulgar message from his answering machine to his lawyer. Now after he has done this the next step will be the lawyer meeting the prosecutor to
    <br/>
    show them the message and if all goes well should get him off the hook. The fact the box was never opened can be fought that he did not know the contents of the package, the message left on his phone clearly shows that he is in danger and did not know
    <br/>
    that the package was even coming. I have seen this method work in the past and it has gotten some friends of mine off the hook also.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now all the prep work is done and I have explained how to avoid jail time. Remember that it is important to keep everyone out of jail as much as you can, they have to stay out of trouble for you to stay out of trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is how it's going to work, Your only in contact with your driver, his driver is in contact with all of the drop shipping addresses, so after he gets the text message he picks up the packages, once he has them all, he meets your driver to drop them off
    <br/>
    to your driver, your driver then brings you the boxes. This type of method is actually similar to how Bin Laden avoided our government for years and is very effective. To add security and more effectiveness you can do the following
    <br/>
    Have your driver purchase a storage unit, then give you access to it, now you never meet him, he drops it off to the storage and a day or two later you pick it up and leave the cash inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some general rules to follow, they should never be forgotten
    <br/>
    1)Never use the same drop shipping address more than once a month(rotate between addresses)
    <br/>
    2)Never use an address again if it has ever gotten stuck in customs
    <br/>
    3)If anything is ever stuck in customs make sure you pass the word down the chain of command that the drop shipping addy guy should know to through the love letter from ICE/Customs in the trash and never respond to it.
    <br/>
    4)Try your best to only have trustworthy people on your team, the least the have to lose the better it is.
    <br/>
    5)No one in this business from your driver, to the drop shipping addy's should be married or have kids.
    <br/>
    6)Try your best to make sure everyone knows and understands the risks, and understands that if no one talks everyone walks, if one person talks everyone's fucked. Including the person that talked!!!
    <br/>
    7)If a lot of your packages are getting stuck from a certain custom department, try to move your op to another state that goes through a different department.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That sums up about everything I know, some of what I said about the drop shippers address may not be necessary, however, this is the safest way to do things that I know of.
    <br/>
    Make sure your importing from a supplier that has been around a long time and knows how to import!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have any questions just let me know, and I do understand this may cause competition for me but hey I love this community and don't mind as long as it is able to help you guys out!

    Please keep in mind nothing is 100% and you should always do your own research and talk to your lawyer before hand to verify everything. Make sure when talking to your lawyer you mention hypothetical situations. Use common sense and put your own twist on things. I know this is a bit sloppy but hey, it's Friday night and I typed this up in a matter of minutes. I hope my fellow SR'ers benefit from this and enjoy the read. Sorry about any grammatical errors!

    Would the phone call to the drop spot really protect them?  You said you have actually seen that work?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems pretty damn obvious its just a way to protect them..  If it went to trial a jury might decide there isnt enough evidence, but a lot of people when offered a plea for just probation vs a *chance* at 10?+ years in prison, would be liable to talk.  From my understanding (which admittedly is very limited) LE want to take out the higher-ups if they think its possible to do that by offering someone else a slap on the wrist, they will often do it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just random thoughts/concerns.  I suppose if you find people you know 100% you can trust, there is a good chance everyone could walk away from it, but its hard to find people like that.  People change when they start to realize there is a chance they could end up spending most of their prime years behind bars(even if odds are in their favor).
