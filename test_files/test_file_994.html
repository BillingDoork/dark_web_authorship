    I wanted to experiment something which I did and it works
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ve ordered  from a domestic vendor which ships next days or in 2 buisness days at most
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I gave my real name and a random address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The next day I went to this address and waited on the sidewalk for the postie to come
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I stood there for about an hour and when I saw the postie asked him if he has a letter for mr ME
    <br/>
    <br/>
    he said yes and gave it to me(I had my id in case  but didnt even bother to ask)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know its a bit of a hassle but it works!!

    Have personally shipped thousands of drug packages...... Only one didn't make it. The one where the name didn't match the address on file. There is a large database that collects this info and flags addresses when certain "triggers" occur, such as a fake name. Not saying this happens to all packages, but honestly ordering with bogus info is dangerous to the buyer, plus you will burn that return address for that vendor if you fuck it up and get shit returned to it.

    so what you are saying is that in order to get your mail you need to be registred on a file right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    dont know where you live dude but in UK (especially big cities) there is none of that
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I d have to give my details to any sort of governments to be able to get my mail I will definetely prefer not to receive anything
    <br/>
    <br/>
    could you please elaborate and tell me why it is dangerous  for the buyer?
    <br/>
    coz as far as I know a fake return address isnt too hard to find isnt it?

    I guess if this is the best you can do and it works for you, have at it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To me it sounds like an awful fucking idea if you need to do it on a regular basis. First off, in the very remote chance your mail is flagged and a controlled delivery, you are screwing yourself right there on the street asking for it. Especially when they realize that you aren't just looking for your mail but just the one piece of mail containing drugs shipped to an address you don't live at. I am no legal whiz but, this seems to border on the territory of mail fraud as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For other practical reasons it seems like a bad idea. What if the mail man doesn't have it that day? I would think it to be slightly suspicious as a mail man to have someone waiting for mail days in a row, especially if the mail man happened to realize he's never seen this person at that address before. Sure you could pick another address next time but how many places are you willing to go? What if you run into the same mail man and you are pulling the same stunt. It just seems like bad idea.

    If you're standing there waiting for it, and the "mailman" physically hands you the package, how is that any different than accepting a controlled delivery?
