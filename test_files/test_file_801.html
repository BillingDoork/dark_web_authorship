    I don't believe that this information will help LE in any way, shape, or form, given that what I'm asking for is their own SOP...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wondering if anyone could give me a quick rundown on the countries that customs from other countries target the most as far as mail interception goes, i.e.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australian Customs:
    <br/>
    NL, Germany, Canada, ?, ?, ?.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EU Customs:
    <br/>
    ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USA Customs:
    <br/>
    ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I figure this will be a good way of narrowing the field of vendors that I'm comfortable ordering from.

    US customs target Holland, Thailand and India.

    UK customs target India.

    <br/>
    Those are the ones I know for sure - Holland is pretty much guaranteed to be targeted by many jurisdictions.

    I had assumed india would be on the USA watchlist, didn't realise it was on the UK one too.  I am lead to believe that its not on the Aus watchlist however.  I've made so many purchases through both clearnet vendors and SR vendors in the last 5 years or so where items are shipped from india and all have arrived.  Probably close to 50 orders total.  None were even opened by customs.

    India and from what I've heard, China as it's increasingly common knowledge that there are many large labs there producing drugs and shipping them here.

    What's your definition of "really fast"? I've been waiting on a package from Eastern Europe for a week and a half. (USA). Just waiting patiently at the moment, but it would be nice to have a time frame to compare it to.

    Our arrival percentage to the US is just as good as European orders.. many of them arrive around a week time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure Holland could be on a targeted country list, but they can't possible inspect all letters and the vendors that step up their game probably don't have too much to worry about.

    I agree with the 3 you have listed for OZ. With many orders under my belt I have seen Germany and NL get tougher first hand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Had a 100% strike rate with both nations until one day they both just stopped.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Avoid Germany, Canada and NL.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The one I would like to know more about is the US. I had a 100% succsess rate then had a bad run with a very reputable vendor (D11) so not sure if it was the vendor or country.

    Are you guys sure canada is a targeted country? because so many reported loses from there? from just the one vendor perhaps?
    <br/>
    Maybe the issue might just be the vendor not the country?..... maybe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv had many no shows from many of vendor from germany so id say its safe to say yea germany is def one...  I think that part of the world would be watched alot.
