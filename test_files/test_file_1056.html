    I placed orders with 2 different vendors, over 9-10 days ago and neither packages have arrived, this is within the US by the way. I messaged them both and both say tracking confirms delivery.
    <br/>
    I really didn't receive anything tho, &amp; if it was seized wouldn't I have received a notice or a knock on the door or something? I tried to find an answer to this question by searching the forum for past topics with similar situations, maybe I didn't check well enough, if thats the case I apologize. I'd be really grateful for any help or recommendations.thanks :)

    2 points here:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) As a vendor I can tell you I have gone through this with what I believe to be honest buyers. DCN says delivered, but the buyer is empty handed. Usually the package turns up at the door with in MAX a couple more days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) Since USPS has changed the Tracking system back in January DCN (Delivery Confirmation Number) to the new "Tracking 400" slips, there has been even more of these types of cases and even more issues.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We have seen some #s not show up in the USPS system at all; some are right on point; some only appear in the system AFTER the package has been delivered....etc
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Suffice it to say all is not lost....yet ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would give it a couple more days and see if the packages do not just magically appear. Assuming of course you AND the vendor are being honest.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would not be worried about anyone "knocking on your door" or anything of the like (although I have not real evidence to back this up)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unfortunately if at the end of all this you still have no packages, the DCN/400 slip says "delivered" and your order ends up in resolution the chances are that the SR admins will side with the vendor and release your funds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not taking sides in any of this only trying to remain objective and state facts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck to both you and the vendor involved. Keep us updated if the package arrives in the next few days.

    If the post man suspects drugs they sometimes will just keep it for themselves as they know you will not go to the police.

    Break out the "Jump To Conclusions" mat....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have seen postal carriers from all walks of life. Old, young, male, female ....every color of skin under the rainbow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Being a Postal Carrier is still considered a Federal job. One that has good benefits and an even better (although admittedly not as good as it use to be pension/ retirement plan)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can not say that there are too many of them that would risk (in any sense) throwing all that way for your "3 grams of weed"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In all the Postal Carriers that I have ever had the chance to "get to know" on any personal level ..the theme is rather recurring... "Once I drop the shit at someones door...it is no longer my problem"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "My job is to get it to that door/mail box"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have even had a conversation with more then one that summed up has pretty much said that "when looking at envelopes and packages all day....they all look the same, there is never any wonder as to whats inside"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now in the off chance your postal carrier is "young" and by all probability male ..then MAYBE...just MAYBE you have one that is "hip" to wtf is "going on" and is not counting the days until that pension plan kicks in. Then he might "steal your shit"...but again I just have a hard time believing it.

    Fair enough. I agree your scenario is not unthinkable by any stretch. I was just saying is is not the first, second or even third thing I would think of really having had happened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tessellated - What was the outcome? Want to share any more details about it? Sounds like an interesting story....

    Only way to get tracking now is to either order it online or go into a post office. Anyone who claims to have a super secret method is just bullshitting the fact they've led a paper trail back to them.

    Sometime in December I had two packages not show up, both of them had tracking saying that they were delivered. It was for quantities that would've had repercussions if the police had intercepted them but nothing ever came of it. I still have no idea what happened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also Shroomeister is right, resolution will favor the vendor if tracking says delivered. I didn't even go to resolution, luckily LuckyLucianno is a stand up vendor and sent me a partial reship to a different address anyways.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And not to derail any further but it is very possible to anonymously get tracking.
