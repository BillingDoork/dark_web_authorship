    Probably meant that the envelope is too big to fit through, so you have to pick it up.

    Yes, that's what i ment in my original post. I'm just asking if i should be concerned in any way about the LEOs ? The letter comes from an EU country (not NL) with me living in a somewhat nearby Western European country. The shipping took 3 business days to complete. I understand that i have no reason to be concerned, and most likely the seller did a crappy job packing the stuff, but still..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My order should have easily fitted my mailbox. I never had problems receiving letters in my mailbox (christmas n brithday cards, etc)Â  from my friends/family abroad (be it EU or USA, even Asia)

    100x pills..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For now, i'm aware that the risks are minimum, and even if i get caught, i can always deny it. The question is if i wanna risk flagging my spotless criminal record. My brain can see all the angles, but the paranoia is eating me alive since this hapend after placing my first order. Unlucky i guess, eh ?

    I'd message the vendor, he might have hidden the pills inside of something larger that wouldn't fit. If he says no, it's quite small and easily fits in a mailbox then you have a right to be concerned and it's a judgement call on risk vs reward at that point.

    Make sure your house is clean, your computer clean.. and then go down to collect it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do get busted, don't say anything other than "lawyer". Then when you speak to your lawyer, say you have no idea what happened. You weren't expecting any mail but you went to collect it nonetheless, next thing you know you got busted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll be fine as long as you don't have evidence in your house/PC. And this is worst case scenario we're talking about here.

    Yea, i did as Kappa suggested and sorted everything out with my pc then went to the postal office. As expected, the pills ware poorly packed, all bulked together in the middle of the envelope and vacuum sealed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I won't be ordering from that seller again, that's for sure..
    <br/>

    Thanks guys for all the info, everything turned out ok in the end :)
