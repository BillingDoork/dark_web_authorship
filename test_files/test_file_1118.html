    He says he got an envelope in which was a small box in which was a shiny bag (with the drugs). And that's it as far as stealth measures go. And it's a little hard to believe for him that a top 10% seller with over 500 sales would only "stealth" their package like this. He believes that stealth measures should be a little more ingenious, at least for top 10% sellers.

    Now for my answer: Some sellers are fucking awesome - ChemicalBrothers for example have amazing stealth techniques.

    Other sellers however... don't. I won't give out names.

    OMG you got exactly what i meant! yeah as a first timer with this kind of shipping coming from a top &lt;10% seller is not what i've expected but he gets all 5/5 reviews..... I don't understand how does everybody believe this is stealth enough to give 5/5 rating....
    <br/>

    And this is something that smells and it did smell outside of the manila....

    The short answer,  no. I've seen some pretty inventive stealth on sr. If you plan on ordering from this vendor again, shoot them a friendly message letting them know you want to continue doing business but your drop was a little freaked out and to protect them to please use extra layers of security.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally would not order again from this person, there are plenty of vendors on sr with hilarious stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One thing I try and look for in reviews is lots of comments about stealth. Most finalize reviews that aren't impressed with stealth will be very brief or avoid the topic altogether.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, see if the vendor has an official review page on the forums. The info you can get from those is much more valuable

    will do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and the thing is I've read all the reviews on the forums and everybody says what great stealth the vendor has. I'm guessing people are afraid to rag on the stealth knowing that the seller has sensitive info on the buyer so they don't want to say anything negative and just avoid all together. IDK! its just my theory..

    The fact that you could smell it through the envelope is what's really concerning.  A double vac seal inside a nice ziploick with all of that inside an MBB usually does the trick. If they can't smell anything and there are legitimate labels chances are you'll never have an issue

    Talk with your vendor. Either he'll convince you that his stealth is good enough, or you'll part ways: you to a vendor who meets your stealth standards, and he to his scores of customers who trust his standards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a free market. If he values your business, he'll probably improve his methods. Don't work behind his back.

    Seen varrying degree's of stealth, some are obviously better than others. As long as the product appears to be something other than what a "drug dealer" would mail I would guess it would be more or less fine. I agree though, the more stealth the better. Best of luck.

    Was it a mylar bag?  Those are growing in popularity.  They have a certain "wow" factor that some people like easily, but that's a minimum effort.  The best vendors not only try to hide the smell, but also try to make the package look like something else even if you open it (without digging too deep).

    Exactly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is not much about the "stealth" but the type of substance the stealth was tied to. For some substances (as DMT or LSD) the package the OP got is not so bad since it is almost impossible a normal letter will get opened and anyway there is nothing passing X-Ray at this time just in case, but for green or other things the sort of stealth the OP explained is completely unacceptable and can put at great risk the buyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would PM the vendor and if he is playing the arrogant prick (instead of apologizing) I would either write it in feedback for others to know. The fact that you are a new member doesn't justify this behavior at all (actually I think that when you have to do with newbies you have to be either more attentive since they obviously - given their inexperience - can commit more errors in case something goes wrong).

    yupp it was only in one mylar bag. and it smelled very strong outside the mylar, but outside the other envelope it was very very faint but i could smell it.

    This just shows that even with a proven track record and top seller status, some sellers stealth needs to be improved.

    No - that's bollocks...really appalling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been taught by one of the top vendors and whilst a new vendor myself have already invested in serious approaches to covert packing. At the least decent sealed bags (MBB ideally) and a plain jiffy...nice printed address etc. It's not complex. For small quantities I think it's fine to be left at that...as it rises, I expect to use more sophisticated packaging to disguise things a little...it's only fair to the customer to try my best.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, without wishing to seem to market on your experience...I am better, cheaper and nicer to deal with ;0

    My definition of stealth is, also stealthy for customs. You don't want a order to be stealthy from the outside and upon opening "oh interesting OPEN IT UP!", no you want "oh that, let it through!"

    I just didn't bother messaging the vendor and just gave him 5/5, but i will not order from him again.

    No vacuum seal, just mylar bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've ordered from a new seller, and he vacuum sealed once and inside mylar. you cant smell anything at all, but once you open it made my whole house smell im not joking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They also disguised the outside to be something else. very clever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Top sellers need to improve their stealth. i think they are getting too comfortable or doing too many orders and have forgot about the customers safely.

    you're absolutely right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But trust me as compared to late '12 even this is an "improvement". You could have ordered in late '12 from one of the vendors and you would laugh and cry at the same time seeing your package. My mate ordered some tabs. Got his package (FUCK KNOWS HOW) 2 weeks later. Inside was a sheet of paper on top of the blotter sheet which said "SuperLSDLABS Germany, thanks for making the purchase for ...... tabs Mr *insert name here*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I saw it and I was like, WOW. It was seriously playing russian roulette at the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Back on topic though. I'd encourage that from every vendor from whom you order and feel their stealth isn't good enough you send them the link to these topics

    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your vendor is legit, it should open his eyes and he should improve his methods. If not, then you don't need to deal with him, plenty other vendors out there who'd want your business and follow the vendor guidelines to go above and beyond expectations for you

    i think green is probably the hardest thing to ship because its so bulky and has a strong odour. that sounds pretty bad if you could smell it threw the package. i'm glad everything worked out.
    <br/>
    i order powder, domestically and although i have received some pretty amazing stealth packages they were probably overkill. maybe i'm naive but i feel secure when its vac sealed thinly in between business papers papers in an envelope with labeled addresses coming from a business address to me. i dont see why they would give this a second glance. i like alot more stealth for customs.

    I may know who you're talking about. Had the same experience recently.  Bud wasn't as great as it should have been either.  Didn't name names b/c it wasn't awful, but he lost my business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That was domestic.  Then there was an international order from a very reputable vendor who had
    <br/>
    "top notch stealth".. that just made me laugh just then.  It was anything but top notch.  The label was handwritten in pencil and they got my name wrong.  Luckily it was delivered, regardless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another problem is people confusing competent shipping methods with stealth in their reviews; very misleading.

    Not really seeing what the problem here is...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean if it was mylar sealed properly there should be no smell. Mylar is better at protecting the odor then vacuum seal...there is a whole thread by SSBD which got me to switch over.
    <br/>
    While my shipping involves more stealth then this it is largely because my shipments are international and are going to places like the Australia and the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was it domestic? If it was I would think this is sufficient, not sure how it could stink though unless the seller is not using separate rooms. In that case I would be worried.
    <br/>
    When I used to be a buyer on here you were lucky if you got double vacuum sealed man...mylar is supposed to be better then vacuum seal. If it stank like bud from the outside this was likely mistakes in the packaging process, and not good stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if you minus the smell, that description would fit 90% of non-bulk orders bud....at least in my experience. Which is why customers tell me that my stealth is next to none, I am one of the few vendors that go beyond that.

    A proper moisture barrier bag (MBB) isn't going to leak the scent but the vendor probably allowed the MBBs (and other shipping materials) to become contaminated with the smell of the weed...maybe keeping shipping materials and the weed in the same room or whatever.

    sounds good to me. you didnt really describe the package from the outside or inside . was there a big noticeable bulge on the package? was the label hand written and messy? was it the mylar bag just stuck in an envelope or hidden in another item? if it looked good from the outside and the vendor used a printed label and no smell then it seems pretty solid. we can only assume they are practicing proper packing procedures before they put the sealed mylar bag in the envelope. they should pack it in a clean room away from other drugs and wash the mylar bag after its sealed and wear gloves when touching the greens but take it off for the rest of the pack. im not a vendor so i can say thats "proper" procedure but its what i read and makes sense. just cuz you can smell it doesnt mean a dog cant. you should ask your verdure for detailed produce he uses.

    Stealth in my eyes is when the contents (drugs) are actually disguised well enough if that a customs officer was to open, they would not find anything suspicous.

    Only about 5-10% of us vendors can really pull stealth off! I have a 100% success rate world-wide so I see no reason why other vendors can't have the same.

    Really depends on what you're paying. For free shipping, I wouldn't expect anything better than this, although the smell shouldn't permeate Mylar / MBBs. If you expect the vendor to hide the goods inside an object, then be prepared to pay $10-30 for shipping.

    i agree.

    imo for domestic, atleast in my country, i wouldnt pay for super stealth. as long as it doesnt smell and is well packed i'm ok with that. for international orders i would spend the money to have to done right.

    The outside had a small dent. I am not sure if this was because of the mailman.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, the address was hand-written.  This was the only concerning part for me as the hand-writing looked pretty distinctive (odd slant/alignment).  Aside from that, the package was pretty innocuous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is hand-written a big sign of "do not reorder from this vendor"?

    The best type of stealth is the kind that has you thinking you got ripped off  ;)

    I've spent close to 5 minutes before ripping and tearing up a package looking for my goodies before. Funny thing was it was a domestic order!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although this type of stealth is desirable, many international overseas vendors merely "disguise" their packages to appear to be something else. Though simple and kind of skimpy, the method works.

    I prefer envelopes over larger packages. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just think they are safer. It's the most common type of parcel, so it blends into a much larger crowd. I also think an envelope is much less likely to be pulled out and inspected. They want to bust big drug shipments.

    The most important stealth is making the shipment smell proof so dogs can't tip it off. The customs are trained enough, that when they have a tip off on a envelope or package, they will search it's contents thoroughly. The shiny bag is most likely foil laminated mylar, which is the best packaging you can basically get.

     Really depends on what you're paying. For free shipping, I wouldn't expect anything better than this, although the smell shouldn't permeate Mylar / MBBs. If you expect the vendor to hide the goods inside an object, then be prepared to pay $10-30 for shipping.
