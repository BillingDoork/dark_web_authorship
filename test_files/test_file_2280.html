    An inside EU envelope has possibly gotten lost (11 days) with 5 grams of methylone. No love letters or anything like that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would it be safe to use this address again?

    I had two shipments not arrive from UK recently. Then a month later after the paranoia subsided, I decided to see if I could receive mail to the same address from UK and from a different vendor and it turned up in 6 days to oz. I have NEVER Known mail to just get "lost" in the system until I started using SR. Ive been around the world sending mail from one country to another and I have never lost anything. So yeah be careful who you order off I guess.

    Try waiting a little longer, I've had packages from the UK and other areas take up to 16 days to get to the U.S., sometimes customs can be really backed up. I've only had one package confiscated/lost, and got it reshipped and received it no problems.

    I received an order from another seller today, but still no trace of the first one. I think this means that the envelope didn't even leave the seller's country and that my address is not being watched.

    Why so much hate towards vendors? Most of them do a really good job and actually try to keep their customers happy. And in case you're wondering I am only a buyer not a seller, I just try to view SR from both sides of the fence to create a fair judgement on both.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you order from someone who has established themselves as trustworthy and reliable you shouldn't have any problems... So why would you order from someone who's not? And in saying this, I believe it is much more worth while to pay a bit more (if you have to) to go through vendors that have an almost untarnished reputation than choosing a much riskier option with the temptation of incredibly cheap drugs (esp compared to aus).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It only takes 1 package gone 'missing' or otherwise probably intercepted by customs,  for the address your currently using to go on a federal watch list for a very long time, so why not play it safe to avoid having to find new address' all the time and even worse, risk getting caught! I read on the SR forum a while ago that Australian customs do not send out letters to the destined address for packages they have seized. It would be a fair assumption to say that the reason for this is to create conflict between buyers and sellers on SR and similar networks/community's, because if the package was not posted with tracking information, what evidence does the buyer have to show the seller that his product never made it to it's destination? There is none, therefor creating paranoia and conflict. So now the facts have been established... It would be fair to say that if you ordered a package from a trusted vendor and it never arrived, it has most likely been confiscated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know how customs operate over in European countries, but I am pretty confident that customs would have found your drugs, confiscated them and decided to not give you benefit of ever knowing what has happened to them. Which essentially leaves you pissed off from waiting anxiously to eventually have nothing arrive, as well as losing your money and having no guarantee that you will get it back, and it creates a level of paranoia that now sits between you and the vendor you bought your shit off because neither one of you trust each other. And top of that, the paranoia that hangs around you at home because your not sure if or when the feds are gonna bust through your door. Even though they have fuck all against you unless the package is open and on/in your property, that paranoia about it still tends to hang around.

    I lost one package and it was a domestic one, I still proceeded to order from several other vendors. No problem. I wouldn't worry too much especially if you didn't receive a love letter and the orders weren't excessive ( 10g  or more kind of excessive).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just make sure to not have drugs laying around at home, preferably keep them elsewhere just to be safe although I am sure it's fine as you would receive a love letter...

    Keep calm ;)

    Vaugely regarding ghr85's comment above, does anyone know if customs are legally obliged to let you know if they've seized goods via post from you? Just idle wondering, I immediately assumed they were but now I think they might be able to keep you in the dark and see what happens. I'm mostly wondering about EU laws but input from anywhere would be interesting.

    Yes. For sure. From my personal experience, I haven't had a problem. It could have been lost somewhere other than customs or not even sent at all.
