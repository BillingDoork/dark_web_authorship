    Order 3.5g of Coke from Canada express mail and it took approx. 6 days to get to the U.S. which is normal. Today the postman came to deliver, I heard a ring but was in the shower at the time, so when I got out and checked the mailbox it had an orangish/pink "Sorry We Missed You" Delivery card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some more details: I has obviously used my real address but used a name of someone who lived here once and still gets mail from time to time. I figured if anything happened it wouldn't be tied to me and I could deny it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The card says 1large envelope sent through express mail would now be at the post office. My main challenge now is has the package been compromised and are they trying to entrap me? The slip has some options on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Either go to USPS/redelivery and tell them when to bring it back.
    <br/>
    2) Sign here to have an agent come pick,it up. that could be me but I'd have to sign for it with me ID at he post office.
    <br/>
    3) I could have delivery re-attempted and there is a check box for leave it at my address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think? If it looks like the package has not been figured out, I don't have an issue taking a small chance to pick it up. The main thing that worries me is that they did not just leave it even if was an oversized envelope. I've gotten larger amazon packages before and they have left them at my door. Is it because it is international and express that they held onto it? What would you guys do?

    express mail from Canada HAS to be signed for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Freaked me out the first time I got an expressed order from Canada because it wasn't the mailman that brought it.  It wax a postal worker that they sent out in his regular street clothes in his own personal car.  Turns out Express mail is guaranteed delivery by noon.  My normal mailman doesn't come til like 5pm.  So they send out a different postal worker to deliver when no mailman is available in order to make the noon guarantee
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you have no reason to worry.  go get your blow and do a line or two or better yet a shot or two form me :-)

    So two days ago I received another express mail letter from Canada and it was left in my mailbox. It was a smaller bubble envelope but if all express mail needs to be signed for, why not this one? It was sent Canada Post expedited parcel just looking at it now. Is that something different?

    Listen Friend...This is nothing more than the PO's standard operating procedure when a mail carrier has a pkg to deliver that requires a signature.  I have no idea how many people miss a signature required delivery each day in the states but it must be thousands if not tens of thousands of people.  There is absolutely nothing here that should cause you even a hint of worry. The best advice is for you to request re-delivery and be sure someone is there to sign.  You can't very well go to the PO to pick up .since you'll def need an ID.  Chances are the mail carrier is not going to ask for ID..he/she just needs an adult signature.  You can request re-delivery online from usps.com.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS...It used to be they would automatically attempt a 2nd delivery with signature required mail and if needed a 3rd.  After that you had to go pick up within 10 days or it would be RTS.  The PO changed that policy a couple years back as a cost cutting measure.  It costs them money each time a piece of mail has to be handled.  That's why  it's not unusual for UPS and FedEx to try a 2nd delivery attempt on the same day if they missed someone the 1st time.  Once a pkg goes out for delivery they do everything they can to make sure it doesn't have to go back into the system.

    Well the main problem you might have is: You've used a name other then yours and when you go to pick up that package, they're going to ask for your ID. Hopefully you're able to maybe setup a redelivery.

    bro,
    <br/>
    i mean go with your heart! if you think its A large package? then yeah could be? but if you know what size you got last time was more than small enough to fit into a mail box. Well i had similar because international, it had to be signed and i could not leave the card it had to be signed infront them or picked up..
    <br/>
    I  mean if you dont do something and you are paranoid then it will be returned to sender which is a fake address. So will go to unclaimed mail center where its opened to see if they can determine whom it belongs too, Then they discover coke and you def not in trouble but being watched, I would clean house! Clean computer!!!!!!!!!!!       Take your laptop or go to library and use public internet and schedule a  redelivery, Now, if its your normal post man no worries, because in stings! ITS A POSTAL INSPECTOR DRESSED UP AS A NORMAL USPS DRIVER, This is given you know your mail man!
    <br/>
    Me i was so fucking noyyed buti grew the ballz and when they come, have the clean house and whip hard drive clean,  If it is a guy you never seen before and you get a bad feeling, Say, what? my amazon order isnt going to be here for 2 more days whos this from&gt;? and when they read it say i dont accept mail from people i dont know, and it could have been a crazy ex sending it and scheduling a redelivery,
    <br/>
    Or on the other hand its the norm guy he comes you sign.  Leave it sit unopened by door and if anything you were going to return it,
    <br/>
    Remember if it is the pigs deny deny Deny . if cops have to ask you questions then they dont have enough on you,
    <br/>
    Well your call but id schedule a redelivery and if goes bad it must be your crazy ex!
    <br/>
    good luck!

    no brainer, sign for redelivery + leave a note telling them sorry i missed you, leave the package next go 'round.

    if u have to go to the office you're screwed because of name mismatch.

    With US post you can call usps posing as receiver and schedule a reship.

    Thanks everyone for the replies. At the end of the day it all worked out and was super easy. I told myself if there was any real,problem they would not be allowing me to just randomly at my own time show up at a post office and would would bust me? They don't have LE just standing there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I went in, showed them the delivery slip, they pulled the large envelope rom the back, I signed on the screen. Do ID even shown or required. The fact I had the delivery slip was enough for them to hand it to me. Piece of cake!

    Yes i was hoping it went well. Its always easy to say just go get it, but about 80% of us have been there. your nervous/worried and when you walk out with it. You say shit all that stress for nothing, but at the same time, never let your guard down! do not ever get to comfortable its good to be concerned! keeps you on your toes and alert!
    <br/>
    I AM JUST GLAD IT WORKED OUT FOR YOU! WE ALL ARE! AND ON TOP THAT YOU REPORTED BACK! many people get advice and never let everyone know how it went! so its good to hear all is well!
    <br/>
    take it easy
