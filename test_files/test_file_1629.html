    I'm in the UK. If I'm expecting a delivery with NBOMe in it - what can the police do? Are controlled deliveries strictly an American thing?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a UK-&gt;UK envelope (no signature required) with some paper in it so I'm not concerned much I just want to know what to do in the worst case scenario (and if anyone has any experience with this)

    Controlled deliveries are certainly not just an American thing, as far as I'm aware.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best thing to do is NEVER sign for anything that your not expecting(and not expecting to sign for it). They can;t do anything if you don't sign for it(again as far as i'm aware).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They recently made NBOMe illegal in the UK didn't they, used to love it getting it legally :(

    So I could order tens of thousands of pills, tabs, powder etc delivered to my house and there's absolutely nothing they can do if I dont sign for it?

    haha well if your talking tens of thousands of pills,powder etc, that's a different story. It won't be seen as personal use, you'll be seen as a distributor.But they still need hard evidence you knew about the package and it wasÂ  intended for you and it wasn't just sent to the wrong address,etc(unlikely that it would be) They'll probably stake out your house in that case, tap your phone, track your movements, etc, do anything to get a warrant, then bust through your door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm no expert mate, but from what I've read so far, this is the mostly likely action. However, if it is a few NBOMe's they find, they'll consider it personal use,confiscate it and send you a seizure letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    peace.

    In America the police can do whatever the fuck they want it seems like. Wish I lived in the UK or Australia!

    The worst-case scenario is they raid your home and find enough gear in your home to charge you with Intent to Distribute. They will NOT need a warrant as they will say they have Reasonable Suspicion (of illegal activity), as such they don't need a warrant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They don't do controlled deliveries. A UK pill buyer/reseller was busted when customs intercepted a package, the police simply turned up at his door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Therefore you should clean house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remove all traces of drugs and (and this is the hard part) also clean out your computers. BY THAT I MEAN MOVE THEM TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION. Take them to a friend's house. You simply do not want your computer equipment seized, it's hugely inconvenient and any evidence of Silk Road could be taken as evidence, and if you have any dodgy porn or torrent films or music they might just prosecute you for that if they can't get a drugs charge to stick.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you clean house they have no EVIDENCE of any crime. Nothing was in your possession. There is no proof you ordered anything. They might, no - will, know what you were up to, but it's POSSIBLE an enemy of yours sent that package in order to incriminate you. The police might know in their heart's that's a crock of shit... but if they can't prove otherwise that's Reasonable Doubt right there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do not act like a gangster, grinning and taunting them. Not not admit anything. Act surprised. Act innocent. Act slightly aggrieved at the entire situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I have no idea what you're talking about. I have never seen that package in my entire life. This is the first I have ever seen or heard of it. I don't know what else to tell you."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When they start talking about non-evidential stuff, that is "well who do you think sent this, and why?" type of lines, say "I can only speculate". Speculation is a legal term - and something that is not admissible as evidence". You can speculate that it's an (unknown) enemy. You can speculate perhaps it's someone who fancies your girlfriend. You can speculate it's someone who you've rubbed the wrong way but has kept a quiet grudge. You can also speculate it's the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The most important thing is to ensure they have no evidence of any crime. So clean house and never confess, not even a little bit.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    I guess the guy above is right. If it's a large enough order they might let it through and stake you out. However remember IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WIRE TAPS ARE NOT ADMISSIBLE IN COURT. They can tap you for information, but they can't use it in court. And MI5 want to keep it that way. Seriously, read up on it if you don't believe me. (If wiretap evidence was admissible then the defence could request all the tapes and all the evidence, and there are reasons why the security forces do not want that to happen). But they do perform surveillance if the quantity is large enough.
