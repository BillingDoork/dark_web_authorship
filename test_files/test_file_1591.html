    I did for my first order, but other than that no worries. All my orders been practically domestic so chance of being seized is low and no one opens my mail anyway :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However I always get paranoid that once i've made the order if I wrote my delivery address correctly  :)

    If you are practicing safe shipping you will not be worried (well your vendor I guess not you)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are practicing safe retrieval methods you will also be safe. How do you do that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Order small amounts that can fit in your mailbox
    <br/>
    - Order packages that do not require a signature
    <br/>
    - When your mail arrives, cross a line through the address, right "Moved" and toss it on the table
    <br/>
    - Wait a day or two, then open it up =)
    <br/>
    - Wear gloves when opening: LE may place inconspicuous polar compounds in the parcel which are deposited on your hand during opening (note the drugs will also be replaced with duds/pseudo-drugs). The polar nature will cause the compound to spread over your hands and make it worse if attempted to wash off.

    I'm sketchy at the moment. Questions running through my head at the moment are...
    <br/>
    Should I have used a different name?
    <br/>
    Will the postie see a different name to this address and catch on?
    <br/>
    Have I been ripped off?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Funny thing is it's over 2 separate orders of 0.25g Heroin. The first is due today so I guess once that's here I'll stop being so damn sketchy and a lot more mellow.

    Well depends on your country. In some countries the name is tied to the address so a different name can have problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However what I would do is order a package on ebay (something cheap from China) and put a different name. See what happens. If they are not showing up likely you have to use your name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stop the paranoia. Just going to make you die that much faster.

    I don't really get nervous that it's going to be a CD or LE at my door, I just get incredible anxiety waiting.  It's a luxury so I don't get mad about it, but fuck do I try and schedule my entire day around when my mail-man comes :(.

    Not really.

    I also don't have a mailman. I just pickup so there's zero interaction really.  That may have a lot to do with it. I don't have to memorize faces in order to check if CD or not.

    I get nervous or anxious when ordering from a new vendor I've never done business with: What is their stealth like? What is the shipping time? If it takes 4 days instead of 2-3, should I be concerned it got intercepted? All sorts of little things...but when I'm ordering from my "regular" vendors, I can pretty much set a watch to them and just know it's going to be there in X amount of days and not to worry until it's a couple days late. Had one delay from USPS that made me really nervous...usually it's always 2 business days for a certain vendor(TheEmeraldTriangle) but this one took 4(5 with sunday) and I was sketched out because it's NEVER been late. USPS just screwed up and it took a couple days longer...no big deal. I don't really worry about domestic anymore tho...just when I order MDMA from Canadia do I tend to get a little more nervous as time goes on since it's unregistered and can take 7-14 days so it's a crapshoot. Not enough to get me CD if caught in customs, but I still don't want the love letter lol

    Especially on here...it's known they can profile by your posts and what not...so here more than any place I would expect people to maybe not be exactly who they really are...which begs the question though....how do you change your style dramatically and still be somewhat eloquent. ha.

    ^^ Talk like you from Detroit. The D, that place is a mess, they won't even bother messing with you. no offense detroit but you guys really need to whip your streets back into shape
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as far as nervousness goes, i just expect LE to come knocking. I Always expect the worst though so i don't get too surprised if it actually happens.
    <br/>
    And another word of advice to calm your paranoia levels, ALWAYS have a clean house!! no caps, mylar bags, clean mirrors ;), nothing incriminating in your pockets/wallets. Have a lock on your phone. heard somewhere if theres no password on your phone, the cops can search it no warrents. I don't live in US so i wouldn't know fo sure
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just had a great idea, have some bullshit letters from the countries you order from. like just a pen pal and it will look like you are shooting the shit, and if you get shit in the mail you can be like "this asshole is being a knob and sent me drugs!" so the blame can never be on you. Or just have random letters from wherever with no drugs in it, it will look more natural

    I don't. For one thing, I research the vendors I use, and when I buy from someone, I'm confident (or at least as confident as it's possible to be) that they're good about stealth. More importantly, I'm too small-time to be worth the effort of busting. Even assuming LE were to find out I ordered drugs (and taking just a few basic, common sense precautions means they almost certainly won't), it's highly unlikely they'll consider the effort and expense of prosecuting me for my 2 pot brownies or 10-strip of acid to be worth it--I'd be far more likely to get a love letter; and while that would suck, it just means that I have to start over with a new place to receive my orders. And even if everything does go wrong and LE does show up at my door, I've still got plausible deniability.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, obviously this may not apply to those who do order large amounts of drugs, or to other countries. But for me, I don't worry about the period when a shipment is in transit. Besides, even if there were a reason to be nervous, once the package is in transit, there's not much I can do about it anyway--so why stress out about it?

    i buyed 200 gr for two times and never arrived , i was terribly sick .. but now i am quite sure that vendor scammed me .. and i hope it is ! Generally for small orders i am free from paranoia , expecially dealing with my favourite vendors , and now that i became a seller i make paranoia-proof letters , just because i know how much important is a low profile mail without smell. have fun

    This. I hate logging in to SR and still seeing 'processing'. Once its in transit I relax. Not worried at all about LE.....but if it doesn't come on expected day I start fiending for my drugs.
    <br/>
    Since finding SR I have developed strong associations with the royal mail.....just the sight of a red van gets me going. Even when I'm not expecting a letter and I'm on a different street, I see a postman and I'm like "god bless you Sir, and god speed you on your way, noble carrier of the queens mail"
