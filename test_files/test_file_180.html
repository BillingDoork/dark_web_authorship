    Hello!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going to a festival in a month or so, and apparently security is pretty tight. From what I hear they sometimes use sniffer dogs, and a reasonable amount of people get searched on the way in (way more than your regular festival).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have ordered a veritable cornucopia of treats from Silk Road, specifically the following (so that you know what the dogs will be up against):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * 12 Dutch Triforce pills (200mg MDMA each x 12 = 2.4g MDMA, if the vendor is to be believed)
    <br/>
    * 1g crystal ketamine
    <br/>
    * 250mg 2C-B
    <br/>
    * 500mg NN-DMT
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The way I see it, I need to HIDE the drugs well (from searches by humans), and GET RID OF THE SMELL (for the dogs). This is my plan:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * I have bought a large "smell-proof" baggie. All of the above-mentioned drugs will go inside this baggie.
    <br/>
    * I was then thinking of wrapping them inside a couple of condoms, partly to take extra steps against hiding the smell, and partly because of my next point...
    <br/>
    * I will then place this package deep inside a tube of hair gel, shaving cream, or something similar. Preferably one with a small opening that I can squeeze the drugs in, vs. a tub that can be opened and inspected easily.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My reasoning is that the hair gel will both hide the smell from the dogs, whilst also hiding the drugs from the security guards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I'm in the festival, I can just cut open the tube of hair gel and remove the package. Because they were wrapped in condoms (which will be covered in gross hair gel) I can cut through them and retrieve a pristine smell-proof baggy of top-quality drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some questions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * Does this sound like a reasonable plan?
    <br/>
    * Am I being overly paranoid? (I don't think so - we're talking about over £200 of drugs here, and apparently security is pretty damn tight)
    <br/>
    * Are "smell proof" baggies actually effective?
    <br/>
    * Would putting the baggy inside the hair gel also help with the smell?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry if I'm rambling a bit, this is an idea that's been kicking about in my head for some time now, and festival time is nearly upon me. Now that I have discovered the SR revolution I can't face taking my chances with dodgy festival dealers... I want, nay demand, the best quality - and that means bringing my own stash!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh... I'm also going to be taking a strip of 10 Xanax with me. I was thinking of just putting them in my wash bag along with my paracetamol, Gaviscon, etc. as it will look inconspicuous. Worst case scenario? "They're prescribed, I have anxiety issues" ... "Where's your prescription?" ... "Uhhhh, I didn't bring my prescription with me to a festival?" Does this also sound reasonable?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for your time.

    I do think you're being overly paranoid.  are they gonna search each vehicle border crossing style? and hair gel aint gonna fool a dog.  You're not carrying bud or something, a smell proof bag should be sufficient in my mind. if they're searching your person, why would you carry a medium to large sized gel bottle into a festival?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dunno, do what you want, but i think you'd be safe regardless. I hope you have a good time! :)

    To style my beautiful hair :) And I'm catching a coach down, so I imagine that the dogs would be ready (should they be used) when the main coach of people from the main city arrives. But perhaps you're right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Apparently they do search quite a large number of people properly (go through their bags and shit) so I was thinking that hiding it inside the hair gel would solve that potential problem. Perhaps I could hide it somewhere else though (still inside the smell-proof bag though).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've still got a month to refine my plan... I'll have a little think, but you're probably right, perhaps I am over-thinking it slightly :)

    This.  Vacuum sealing and multiple bagging will help dampen the amount of odor, theoretically reducing the range that a dog can detect it from, but the hair gel will essentially do nothing to hide the smell, just like masking the smells of drugs with coffee or peanut butter or dryer sheets is ineffective.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMO you're being way too paranoid.  If there ARE going to be dogs, they will most likely be looking for large amounts of cocaine or marijuana...but I doubt it.  Drug dogs are so ineffective at festivals because sooooo many people are holding drugs.

    8) Funnily enough I only searched this last night on the forums. The best advice I found was either ballbag it. Ie, stick your stuff to your knob with sticky tape or the back of your ballbag with an elastic band or tape. Otherwise there were the boxer shorts which had a smuggling compartment attached.

    If you're going to global gathering... by any chance- from what I've heard you have reason for concern
    <br/>
    My idea regardless would be to get many small smell proof baggies, but everything in a different place. Wrap each bag in sellotape well, which you can cut open later. flatten things that can be flattened, and put them in unlikely places. Tube of gel is probably overkill. Maybe like sticking it right under the sole of the toes of shoes with stuff inside them (or on ur feet?), in a the bottom of a girls tampon bag, girl's bra, be imaginative ;)

    bad.  girls hair (bun) good. no one fucks with a girls hair.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you're scared about the smell, vac seal it twice the day off. if you vac seal too early, the smell will permeate. also be careful of smells on the outside of the bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i doubt the car search will be THAT BIG of a deal.

    Yeah, the dogs are pretty fucked. Seems loads of people still get stuff in though but a lot get caught. My thinking is that is you hide it half decently, then the people who havent will get done first.

    From my personal experience and from what I have heard, the dogs are usually only there in the beginning....they tire quickly.  So maybe arrive later with the goods.  You may want to check the festival sticky as well.

    Hopefully US festivals dont start this with drugs...  I don't they would though since in the long run they want to make everyone happy and make as much money as possible...drug dogs would scare away a lot of people.

    Thanks for all the advice, everyone!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FYI, the festival is in the UK. Normally UK festivals are okay, but from what I've heard on forums etc., the past two years they've really stepped up security on the way in with lots of searches and even the dogs, hence my concern.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I have no control over getting to the festival later (when the dogs might be tired / out of use) as I'm getting one of the coaches that festival runs for the event, so will be getting there at about midday or early afternoon I guess (probably peak time).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I'm thinking that the hair gel idea isn't such a good one. I don't think that my wife would be too keen on sticking a bunch of drugs up her snatch either, unfortunately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking that I might wrap them up in cling-film, a condom, a smell proof bag, cling film, another condom, more cling film, another smell proof bag, and then for safe measure, another condom.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then either:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * hide it in something completely inconspicuous, bury it DEEP inside my back pack, and hope for the best
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * or put it in my specially made boxer shorts which have half a sock sewn to the inside of the front (a "drug pouch", if you will) that I sometimes wear to get my stuff into nightclubs - but then a dog might come sniffing around my crotch, which would be more suspicious than a dog sniffing around my bag (where the guards hopefully wouldn't be able to find my stash if it's hidden well enough?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Decisions, decisions....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: actually, perhaps a modified version of the hair gel idea isn't so bad. I understand now that it won't protect against smell, but if I handle the smell through other means (the excessive condom/smell-proof-baggie/sellotape combo described above) and put it in a tube of product that I could reasonably be taking to a festival for legitimate reasons (like hand sanitiser or something), that could work. Especially if the opening is narrow and the only way of getting the stuff out is to cut open / destroy the container. That way security wouldn't be able to casually look inside and would probably just gloss over it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT 2: Or, carefully open a tube of Pringles, take half out, put the stash in there, fill the rest of the tube up with the Pringles that were taken out, and use prit stick or some other glue (not super glue, basically) to re-seal it. Seems like that could hide it well, if the smell was taken care of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Okay, ramblings over... for now...

    I think they're called Stashwear, i have the link on my computer somewhere.  I highly doubt they are super comfortable though... you may want to wear them into festival then switch into different boxers in the bathroom once inside...

    The people that hold festivals need some of their punters to be on drugs. People on drugs make the job of security a lot easier. If people were just left drinking alcohol, there would be way more hassle at the festival, in the form of people fighting etc. That is just my opinion anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as getting your gear into the festival, here is what I do:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buy a multi-pack of breakfast cereal. You know the ones that have maybe 10 or 12 small boxes of different cereals. Carefully slice open the end of the boxes and put your drugs in with the cereal. Place them in the smell proof baggies before hand and then glue the cereal box closed again. Then mix the cereal boxes (including ones without drugs in them) with your other food for the weekend, in a shopping bag and you will walk in without hassle. They can't go opening your food boxes as that'll ruin your food.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This has always worked for me and I have been to a lot of festivals over the years.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have fun,
    <br/>

    That's actually a pretty damn good idea. Similar to the Pringles idea, but perhaps a bit better as there will be "decoy" boxes of non-drug-containing cereals. Plus people take mini cereal boxes to festivals all the time. All I would have to do is take care of the smell (which I'm pretty confident that I can do). I think we may be on to a winner here :)

    I'm also waiting on a pair of stash-pocket boxers :P  Currently, I have a stash can (tall 24oz Arizona Iced Tea) that I got at a local head shop.  It's weighted, so it blends in nicely with a few legit cans of Arizona Iced Tea.  It won't stop dogs, but never had any trouble getting through any festival security with it.  I also have a 'stash baseball cap', with a nice built-in velcro pocket, but I can only fit so much contraband in there before my head looks lumpy....lol
