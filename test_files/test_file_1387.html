    Does anyone have experience with package holding companies and are they safe delivery addresses? Basically these are private companies that you address your packages to, and when they get delivered the company signs for them and holds them until you pick them up for a small fee (5 dollars or so per package). They work kind of like PO boxes. I was thinking of sending all my SR purchases to be delivered to a package holding company since lately someone has been fucking stealing packages that I get from the mail from my doorstep. Do you think these package holding companies are legit and a good idea to use? I only order large amounts of cannabis btw.

    Not sure. I have US-based address from a company that receives goods and re-ships them internationally, for people who want to order from places that only ship to the US. As far as I know, they have a huge warehouse that operates like a post office, only privately run. Only used it a few times, but it never occurred to me that such a place would allow people to pick parcels up in person. Is this basically what you're talking about?

    The place I'm talking about is a little different, they hold packages for you when you are on break, vacation, etc so you can pick them up when you return. They email you when a package with your name arrives and you go there to pay the fee then pick it up. Helps make sure that you don't miss the mailman and have to get it the next day from the post office, or if someone is stealing your packages as in my case.

    My first thought was this resembled what I've described in my thread Mail Forwarding and Virtual Office Providers - Concept and Thoughts: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161081.msg1143742 where Virtual Offices provide the option of signing for your packages, but then I saw you mentioned this:

    This makes me unsure if this is really the same thing as there's not too much intelligence contributed in the thread except from me and I've barely skimmed the surface myself so far. I would be willing to research this concept in detail but I have to know exactly what I should be looking for as the term "Package Holding Companies" will just yield results of Holding Companies, ie. companies who own stock in other companies. It's also possible some of the Mail Forwarders have this service as an add-on but it's hard to find the information without knowing what to look for on their websites.

    The company I'm referring to also ships packages for you, but you have to bring them in-person and they make the label and ship it out (only UPS though). You can also drop off UPS packages that you pre-paid for. They don't really forward mail or send it to another address once your packges arrive to them. You go to the building in-person and pick them up, much like USPS and their "recipient not present" slips work. This service is only useful for SR customers, not vendors. I believe the "mail forwarding" companies you posted about benefits vendors mostly so they can ship large amounts of packages efficiently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll know tomorrow if its safe or not because I decided to order a couple SR packages to be picked up from the package holding company. I don't see how it wouldn't be safe. The only vendors I order from have professional stealth, and after all SR packages are just normal mail right...  8)
