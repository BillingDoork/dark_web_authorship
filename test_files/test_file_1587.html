    I included my address in English *and* in the language of the country where I will be receiving the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After a second vendor for an order made at the same time indicated that the non-English characters had potentially been garbled by the PGP, I contacted the first vendor to make sure that the non-English writing had been proeperly rendered on my package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor only included the English because the other language was "not understandable".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Packages and mail addressed only in English generally take 4-6 weeks longer than packages and mail addressed in both languages.  In one instance, a package took 4 months!  There have been multiple instances of an English only package being delivered to the wrong address (yet eventually making it's way to me) as well as mail that hasn't arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Years of doing legit international business give me a fairly high degree of certainty that the package will *not* be arriving by the time I've extended once (and possibly twice).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, even though it's only been three days since the vendor marked it "in transit" I need to ask "At what point do I go to the Resolution Center"?

    You do not even have the option of going to the resolution center for 10 days after it was marked in  transit....
