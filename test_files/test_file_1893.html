    I was expecting A package today. In my PO Box I got a yellow slip saying I had to pick it up from behind the desk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Underneath there were four boxes giving reasons why this happened:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The article is too large for the box
    <br/>
    There is too much mail to fit into your box
    <br/>
    Postage due
    <br/>
    The mail requires a signature
    <br/>
    <br/>
    None of the boxes were checked so I'm not sure what reason they have for holding. But I can rule the second reason out seeing as I only use my box for SR and besides this yellow slip it was empty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can rule the third option out as I finalized early for a very trusted seller, paid shipping with the order and why the fuck would a vendor have the customer pay for shipping on receipt?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This leaves two options: they found the MINISCULE amount of contraband I had mail (.1 gram of H) OR the seller sent it in a package too large to fit in my box.  The latter I feel confident I can rule out considering the size of my order and the fact that they normally would put the package in one of the lockers and put the key in my PO Box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else received one of these slips.  I'm at a loss for what to do.

    I wouldn't touch it. This raises the question though is ignoring the package a good idea? Perhaps inquire who it is from and the reject it. Do not sign anything. It's a loss either way, burn your drop point cut your loses and lay low.

    They don't ALWAYS put it in the big locker. Sometimes those are full. Why don't you ask what size the package was? Sometimes vendors send it in those tall envelopes and the mailman doesn't want to fold it to make it fit.

    It could be that your mailman was too lazy/forgot to tick a box. There have been several threads where cheap-skate vendors haven't paid enough for the postage requiring clients to pick it up and pay the rest, have a good search in these forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd just pick it up if I was you, I've received similar slips for stuff that I had no clue what it was.

    Agreed with above. If LE is involved not inquiring about the mail would raise suspiction. Might as well grab it.

    Do you really think LE is going to sit around and wait at the post office for you to show up to claim the package? No, they'd just try to deliver to your door.

    Don't risk legal trouble for 0.1 g of heroin.  I'd let it go.  But that's just me.  I see the other side of the argument too.  Whatever you do, proceed with caution and if anything seems fishy, reject the package.  Let us know how it turns out.

    It's a standard card Post Offices put into PO boxes when there is big items or items that require a signature.

    I wonder what their policy is for mail that is not picked up.  Would they send it back to the return address?  Do they eventually destroy it or would they open it before destroying it?

    This has happened to me before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It just means the package was too big to fit in the box.  It happens all the time.  If it were intercepted by LE, you would get a love letter.  If it's a domestic package, the chances of it getting somehow intercepted is low.  You should feel safe just going to the post counter and getting it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they ask you to sign for it though, I wouldn't do that.

    If the color is yellow and yellow is your favorite color than with high probably it's ok.. Where i live it has no color.. That's how i got busted myself and had my flat raided in 3am.. Though i believe you like most people here live in some other place where such would be unimaginable.. Pay attention to suspicious cars parked in front of the po with these mfs inside like the one i saw myself and nevertheless..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you wish go and get it. Just remember cleaning your apartment, encrypt your computer or rather move your pc and phone to some other place for a moment. They will take away these first.. But man maybe you don't need all of this? Definitely not for h.. It's up to you..

    LE is not going to waste all day waiting in the back of the post office on the off chance you might show up to claim the package,,, you should be fine.

    Go pick it up. I've had to do this multiple times. It's just because I wasn't there to sign for it. Dont worry, it's not a CD (that's a 'Controlled Delivery' if you didn't know--this parenthetical explanation definitely defeats the purpose of that abbreviation. Hmm. Fuck it............I'm high as balls right now.)
