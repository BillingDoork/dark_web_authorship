    hey hey all long time no speak....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Been outa the country for a while and after staying in LA for quite some time I can work out the prices even on SR ........ with little to no effort we found a connect for 8s @ $150 (fish-scale real good stuff like MINs back in the day) straight from some Mexican dudes we met at Hooters hehe...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now im seeing vendors wanting like 450+ (few Canadian ones few American ones) for 8's .... and mates have received and said its garbage and they only use the NL vendors with about a 50-75% hit rate .. (still more then double what we paid)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dunno what happened ..... in the days of tv and min and a few others you could grab 2 8's for 500 and it be here in 7 working days ..... i guess those days are finished... *pity* ... im thinking it may not just be a customs problem im thinking people are setting up that are used to grabbing a few oz's and getn swamped with orders and are having to cut the beeejus outa it to come good ... cause price vs quality vs delivery times etc dont seem to add up anymore
    <br/>
    <br/>
    meh not that it matters just thought id have to my 2c

    Welcome back my friend :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, we remember being able to buy top quality stuff from even a guy on the street in New York many moons ago. The US has very cheap drug prices mainly due to the cartels in Mexico bringing the shit in mass quantities. Meth, heroin, coke and weed is all there and cheap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We are an island surrounded by sea and you gotta either ship, fly or smuggle it in somehow, hence the prices.
