    Did you already order anything to Switzerland ( USA, EU) ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are the customs controlls persistent ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which countries are safer than the others?  ( I think they check the shipments from the Netherlands more persistent than the others)

    Bad English I know.

    Hi there
    <br/>
    <br/>
    mmm first of all, it is not true, that you receive drugs in Switzerland except, Heroin... Yes.. there is a clinical program which gives medical produced heroin (pure like shit) or Methadon to addicts if they have registered in this clinical program. Otherwise if they are not registered in any program, they will get their shit from the streets. Not that pure at all.. but sometimes, as some addicts dont use all of their stuff from the clinical program and sell it though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the addicts from the streets, there are "legal" places to get the shot. There is medical person available which helps with clean needles and call the ambulance if there is an overdose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT, heroin is still illegal and all other drugs to. Switzerland has a very tight law on Research Chemicals to and there up to date very fast... :( :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, I am interested in your experience in receiving shipments to Switzerland. I was wondering, as Switzerland is not part of the EU, I think the customs are harder to pass as if you send and receive between EU states. What are your experiences??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please only answer, if you have make these experience, either received product from outside Switzerland, or shipped to Switzerland.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise, is there maybe some seller which offers products which are shipped inside Switzerland?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you all :)
