    Okay, so I already know the answer to this.
    <br/>
    And address is an address. period.
    <br/>
    Correct?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My friends seem to think that people who use P.O. boxes are putting themselves more at risk for a CD then those who ship to their home addy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone care to comment?

    Thanks for your reply!
    <br/>
    I meant for those who use their real name for packages. As it is a bit more difficult to acquire legit fake docs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless, an addy is an addy.
    <br/>
    Because there are cameras in post offices, people seem to be more afraid to use them as drop sites.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The post office doesn't look at packages assigned to P.O. boxes with more scrutiny simply because they are assigned to a post office mail box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I right, or am I right?

    Does your post office make you sign for packages you have to pickup at the window if they don't fit in your box and the vendor doesn't add "signature required?"  I've never signed for a package and have never been asked to.  Just curious what some of the procedures are at different post offices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And to OP I personally think PO Boxes are less risky in terms of controlled deliveries and shit going down, but I also feel they are more risky because while there are all kinds of reasons people may get PO boxes, the fact is most people don't get them and I think a lot of people that receive contraband or have stuff to hide use them.

    No, not normally.
    <br/>
    I usually get all my mail and it comes thru my box like normal, so long as it fits.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had to go and get my package from behind the counter before due to them putting a slip in my box even though the pack would've easily fit in my box.
    <br/>
    I've never signed for a package though.

    I've never had to sign for anything at my PO box. The slip goes in the box, possession of the slip is proof it's your box or you're acting on the behalf of someone else to pick up their mail. My Grandma lived in a town without door to door delivery, and would paid some kid to walk to the PO and get her mail. The act of taking the slip up to the counter to retrieve something offers no less plausible deniability than picking up a "unexpected" package off your porch. People receive packages they weren't expecting all the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My use of a PO box has nothing to do with what is or is not being delivered to me, a few years ago some hoodlums repeatedly smashed my mailbox. Fucking kids these days.

    If you are ordering to your own home or PO box using your real name you need a reality check anyway. Personally I wouldn't do either of those things and it would be just as easy to make you come in and sign for something at the post office and catch you on CCTV as it would to have you sign for a delivery at home, either that or just kick your front door in a few minutes after you take the post inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you open a PO box do it anonymously, yes that raises the stakes but it also severs the link between you and the box, if you are not doing that why even bother ordering to a PO box? just order it to your home, at least you may have some more plausible deniability, well so some people think anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Having drugs sent to your home address is madness IMHO, especially if you are ordering from overseas when you consider the additional trafficking charges you can tag on to the list you will be facing if it goes tits up. I get finding safe anonymous drops is not easy but if you cannot navigate this place safely then you really shouldn't be using SR at all, what price would you put on your liberty or a criminal record that will fuck you for life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything we do here is risk versus reward and the stakes are quite high for fucking it up so it pays to be very careful when considering your options.

    So in answering my question, "Are PO Boxes more risk than a home address?"
    <br/>
    You're pretty much saying that one is neither more risky than the other. Simply walking into a PO to retrieve my mail adds no more risk than walking out to the end of your driveway and getting it out of your mailbox?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An addy is an addy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I assume if I was under that much surveillance that they would find some way to get me, if they really wanted to. Regardless of where I picked up my mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is the point that I try to get across to my friend, that I am not putting myself at any more risk simply because there is a camera watching my mailbox. I highly doubt the cameras in my post office even work anymore.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you for your replies.

    In all honesty I could not say if a PO box is more risky than ordering to your home, in the eyes of the law they would probably be viewed precisely the same. My unqualified subjective assumption though would be a PO box is more risky given the chances of someone inadvertently sending you drugs in the mail would be exponentially less to a PO box than your home address if you were put into a situation where you had to deny all knowledge. When you combine that with the CCTV issue not being a factor at home if you really had to go that route then I'd use the home address over a PO box registered in your real credentials.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But again, both those options are fr from desirable, get an anonymous drop arrangement.

    Theres not much plausable deniablility with a PO if you have it shipped to your real name. I use my real name at home, no use tipping off or confusing your mailman who is probably the biggest threat to getting caught. So either use your real name at your home and deny, or use a fake name to your PO and claim it must of been addressed wrong. If you use a PO u need to set up a pattern of mail pickups so it doesnt look like u were expecting it.

    What if you were to put your PO Box in a "fake" business name? Or can't you do that? I know it could still be connected to you, but I feel like it would look less suspicious to have an "office" there for a business than just randomly getting one, no? No idea if they require tax documents and everything or not for that tho...

    Exactly. We should make a collaborative thread outlining the best tactics to get bulk in from over seas. Rather than just reject other people's suggestions and assert that they should magically find the perfect method.

    That all sounds fine and dandy, but I feel like the reason it's a secret might be to protect the method? I have no actual idea because I'm curious too, but I think it was supposed to be common knowledge, there would be a tutorial section. Just a guess tho.

    is signing really so much more evidence? clearly one signs a package wich is directed to him/her. sure this will be a point in the prosecution but not a really valid one, since 90% of ordinary people would do so.
    <br/>
    you can always leave the package unopened for some days with 'return' written on it. i think this favors a lot your position in case of a home- raid.
    <br/>
    i do not see much advantage in using fake documents for a PO drop, as this could only add more to the charges..
    <br/>
    if LE cant proof that you bought those drugs i doubt they can charge you with very much. therefore having high security measures regarding cash-flow and TOR-Connection seems to me much more important.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    using a friends add or some anonymous drop add on the other hand sounds quiet usefull..but finding anonymous drop adds in some countries will be very hard to impossible..
    <br/>

    what are your opinions on my approach?

    Discussions about safe drops are best had via PM, posting openly on the forums is vigorously discouraged for obvious reasons, it is in nobodies best interests to assist LE and many people guard their arrangements very carefully.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Arrangements differ from country to country too, for example in Australia you can use any name you like for  residential or business address and the mail man will deliver it. In the US you cannot do that, mail will only be delivered to the registered person(s) residing at that address so if you try to use a fake name the mail may be returned to sender and likely end up in the dead letter room and opened by a postal inspector, not a good outcome.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So a safe drop is essentially an address you can order too that does not link back to you so in the case of an intercept you have nothing to worry about. All my SR orders go to safe drops, if I get a no show I burn it and move on, something everyone should do by the way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How you go about getting a safe drop as I said will depend a lot on were you live and not many people on here will just offer up their tried and tested methods to anyone. It took me many months of research to develop the systems I use, all the information is on these forums if you do some research.

    Without wearing gloves? No.
    <br/>
    I mean, obviously I do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But just play that scenario out in your head.
    <br/>
    You walk in, grab the PO box application.
    <br/>
    Fill it out and hand it to the person working behind the counter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess you could take it back home, fill it out, wipe the prints, and return later but I still find all of this a bit difficult to do without getting your fingerprints on the paper.

    I think this thread may be serving to be too specific in the nature of actually providing an appropriate route for success for the OP.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look, every locale is different - every person, every neighbor, every postal office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In actuality, the best thing about the postal service in the US, is its inconsistency. EVERY office is different. In one, you might have a bunch of overly-suspicious people working the counter and an administrator in the back that cracks a whip at even the slightest idea that something is going on. At others, there isn't a single CCD camera in the office and you could probably score off the clerks at the desk (though, I wouldn't recommend it.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing that will ever work or ever be true is research. At its heart, what we do is espionage. You don't walk into a town and instantly have yourself an idea of what to do - it requires extensive scouting, research, information gathering, and asset development. The solution will almost always be different, though the method that works for /you/ will be the same for you in each area. Some are good at social engineering, some are good at being invisible. Some are good at just blending in with the noise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be truly safe, you must develop these skills and apply them. Otherwise, you merely copy someone else, and that puts the both of you at risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can honestly say that in my current city, I use a PO Box. The office I go to, is particularly wonderful for my needs. I can also say that it took me about two months, to lay down this line.

     I have had drops where the clerks were PARANOID AS FUCK. One girl used to have shaky hands every time someone went in. After a few times, my partner felt like it was being watched for sure. I've had other ones where we got nothing but good vibes all the way and didn't even have to sign! I've had some that dropped it right into my buddies box, no questions asked, and I had another one that used to ask her what she did for a living. Practice and Research are everything. Do not EVER get complacent, because that is EXACTLY when they will strike. Telling you.

    It is also worth nothing that we are not the only community/culture that uses the mail to send things that would be of an incriminating nature. There are plenty of "organizations" that utilize the mail for more than just drugs. Because of that, there are some post offices that are, and always will be, under extremely close scrutiny. The world is a big place, and crime takes many forms. This is one of the main reasons appropriate amounts of research are necessary.

    If you are scrutinizing this that much I assume you are doing big things, so with that said find some chick or a dude what ever makes you more comfortable rent a place pay there rent and all that etc use that as the drop address.  Make sure the person you have staying there has the crib in there name and all utilities make sure they have a job and arent some junkie or gangster thug at least a normal person of society well persay that our government would consider normal.  Buy 24/7 surveillance equipment that you can see from a website anonymous yes its out there, the point of this would be to keep and eye out on your drop site to see if its ever compromised.  And most important you the main man the fucking head honcho never have contact with this drop site never be seen there etc, I mean the person that lives there accepting your packages dont even fucking know you but you know them, you have someone inside your circle that you trust again that doesn't deal with illegal activity and is clean go pick up the packages from that drop site and deal with the person that stays there.  1 the person staying there doesnt have to pay rent so believe me you can find alot of willing individuals and even spend a lil and furnish it for them a lil bit trust me people that are happy dont cause problems. 2 they have no clue whats in the packages never tell them yes they more than likely suspect but still they have no clue they dont know you and the person they deal with dont hustle get it, I have used this system for three years now and have three spots and have never had a issue never, there is more to it but this is just a quick get the idea plus im not going to divulge all my secrets do your research.
