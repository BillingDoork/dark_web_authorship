    So a domestic, untracked package (hash) from a very trusted vendor has failed to arrive in spite of a half-dozen others arriving successfully.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While waiting for this lone straggler, I ordered a couple of other things domestically.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now it occurs to me that if the missing package was opened and discovered, would they have let me off the hook and tossed it? Or started work on a warrant? Or maybe stolen it? And in the former two cases, would they be on the look out for the other packages in my name and open them too?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm new to Canada and I'm not familiar with the law, but these thoughts make me quite anxious and I'm considering temporarily burying the rest of my stuff somewhere or something.

    Well, yes it was. I'm compelled to answer honestly (in spite of not wanting to besmirch the vendor's name, having no reason to believe they are at fault or that it's not just a really slow delivery) that it was to know how the hell you knew that! I don't even use the same name as a buyer. Unless it's just a matter of there being a limited number of vendors who match this description.

    Well im located in southern U.S and awhile back ago I got 1 gram of the Moroccan hash from bashful betty
    <br/>
    it took 5 days sent monday got it friday stealth was good enough she uses mbb's
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    --edit
    <br/>
    and i jsut put two and two together your name is another girl and you have a picture of one and i figured you would probably buy from a women and theirs only a few people selling hash in canada i belive not sure now
    <br/>
    and i decided just to take a guess and i was correct

    That's not encouraging really. It's been 11 days since shipment in this case and it's domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I didn't really assume the vendor was a female. But maybe I can use my feminine wiles when the mounties come to get out of this.
