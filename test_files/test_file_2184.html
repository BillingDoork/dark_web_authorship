    Hey sorry if this has been asked before, I've been around Silk Road since the beginning but had to leave
    <br/>
    for a few months due to personal complications. I come back to see that this has gotten a LOT of attention
    <br/>
    from Australia including some more news about customs "cracking down" on this sort of thing
    <br/>
    (source : http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/dark-net-drug-deals-boom-on-cyber-silk-road-20120809-23wdj.html)
    <br/>
    Also a lot of my past suppliers have been informing me that they are having a very low success rate sending to Australia lately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if many people have been having success shipping product into Australia lately?
    <br/>
    (I'm mainly referring to cannabis with this question).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's pretty upsetting to find out locally the amount of underage kids who have found out about this site.
    <br/>
    I wish things weren't like this, i wish i didn't have to hide under an anonymous title in fear
    <br/>
    of facing imprisonment. I'm still bewildered that all of this is illegal really. Anyways I'm beginning to ramble,
    <br/>
    I'd appreciate if some Aussie users could give me some info on the current situation cause I've been out of the loop for so long since my last shipment didn't arrive.

    I'd be more concerned if the people protecting us with guns couldn't google "drugs online" over a year ago and find this place. Think they've been aware a lot longer than we have jesus ;)

    I was referring to the wired and gawker articles that came out of June last year, and I think it's safe to assume if a giant media corporation can find SR than LE can.

    i think those pig bastards are more worried about shit irl that they can actually see physically and its less of a headache than sitting on a cpu and trying to bust someone internationally that would just be a huge waste of money,resources and time but they are pigs and we all know how much extra work they like to put in lol

    Hopefully everyone keeps on the hush.
    <br/>
    If the cops think that not many people are using SR the better.

    The AFP like to ruin everyone's fun. To them only a little amount of people can be having this fun...

    If the AFP dedicate officers on the basis of how much profit this website generates, then they must have 1 officer on the case.

    SR makes 20 - 25 Million pa. A random Australian suburb like Frankston would make atleast double that through drugs.

    We remember JesusJoints fondly as one of the pioneer buyers in the Australian SR community, a connoisseur of all things green and great contributor.

    I am sure the Police have been aware of SR from the beginning. SR was not the first online drug market or forum on the Hidden Web and won't be the last. As it stands today, it's a matter of the Police don't yet have the ability to locate the SR servers, although I'm sure they are working hard on it world wide. Until that happens, trolling the site and forum, gathering information and documenting what they find coupled with setting up fake vendor and buyer accounts is there only ways of gathering intelligence. To think the Police don't care about SR or aren't allocating any resources into learning about the site and looking for ways to exploit and infiltrate it is a silly attitude IMO. Just because it hasn't been mentioned publicly doesn't mean it's not happening behind the scenes. There is no way Customs have the ability to x-ray every item that arrives in Aust. with the current resources they have. If your smart with your purchases and use a vendor, who you know from previous experience, takes care and packages your item stealthily and professionally, your package will arrive. There is not a more important aspect to a successful international delivery other than the vendor's packaging :)
