    i recently received a bill directed to who i believe is the person who rented the PO box before me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    could i use there name to get packages?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also what if you put ex.. DR.john smith instead of Mr john smith, would that make it looks more professional?

    If you are trying to impress the vendor you can put Dr.

    Up to you if you want to try and get a package using the previous owners name. I don't know if I ever get junk mail in the form of packages addressed to the previous owner though. If getting packages addressed to the previous owner is going to be a regular thing it might raise some eyebrows. I personally just use my real info and trust the vendor to do a good packing job. If it looks like a normal package then mail people will assume it is a normal item inside and not think twice. If you give them a reason to think twice (different name, package addressed to previous owner, misspelled name)Â  then you might have an issue even if it looks like a normal package.
