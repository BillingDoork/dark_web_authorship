    So I feel fairly familiar with how controlled deliveries work, and how to avoid getting busted by them. My general idea of avoidance was always to not open the package either for a few days or to take it somewhere else where you know you aren't being watched and open/store it there. For a PO box though (which is what I use) am I incriminating myself merely by picking the package up from my box or does the rule of thumb "I haven't opened it, no idea what's in it" still work?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And another question, if the above isn't incriminating, And I can indeed pick it up out of my PO box; let's say I get it in my car, and then I'm pulled over and searched. If they find the closed and sealed envelope/shipping package in my car, can that be used against me?

    depends on if has tracking and you checked it. Also if you have received others from that vendor or same area with tracking. Its a tuff call. I mean id wait a few in case they are trying a CD. I have seen someone i know personally before my SR days. have a po box. his hook up got busted and the cops took his order from the confinscated comp and waited until he came to get pack.
    <br/>
    Now, if your going to get it. Id send a few things there with it like regular mail. That way not only thing you pick up. Then when you get to car write
    <br/>
    RETURN TO SENDER.Â  As if you did not notice it until in car. but if its only item in there. then why would you take it to car if you intent to return in,,,,,

    That's a good idea as far as the return to sender writing it in the car. And I already have mail being sent to it, I actually opened up the po box a few months ao so it would look like I established it for personal use. But alright, thanks!

    no problem.
    <br/>
    to be honest ANY TIME I RECEIVE!! I WRITE
    <br/>
    "RETURN TO SENDER" and let it sit for awhile:) but yes I mean I can not promise anything but if that were me. That is what i would do and i would make sure its not the only piece of mail. That way you have a few pieces and may have not noticed an "odd" piece that you planned to write return to sender.
    <br/>
    I wish you the best! come back and let us know how it worked out!

    thanks
