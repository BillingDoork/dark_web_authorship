    I'm looking to have some coke shipped. How does this work? Do people really provide their real names and addresses to have drugs shipped? If not, then how does is work? Hopefully someone can inform me of a way that does not involve my actual name or address.

    yes. you duct tape a magnet to the coke, and put another magnet at your drop point. The laws of physics do the rest.

    all your questions have been asked before and u can find them out yourself easily, just try the forum search ;)

    and yes, it is recommended to use real name and real address, alternatively you could set up a PO Box with fake name, but therefore you need to have a fake id, and there are also other disadvantages. just use your real name and address and make sure that your house is clean when your package arrives (means no drugs / drug accessories in your home, your shipping address) and then you will be fine!Â  :)

    It probably be cheaper to buy Coke at your local grocery store or gas station. Just give them a fake name and make sure to use your neighbors address. Or you could simply order from a reliable vendor and order something small and use your real name and address and it should get there without a problem. Are you using TOR or did you access the forums through a regular internet browser?
