    So, I used this site http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGcrypt.htm to encrypt my message (which consist of my SR user name, what I ordered, and address)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I then got an encrypted message. Do I simply copy paste this message into the SR order form (the 'Please enter your name and address as it would be written on a letter' box) ? Do I need to give the seller MY public key? Would that be my 'key id' from the website listed above?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In browsing the forum I had found a thread about 'PGP' encryption club, but lost the thread. I wanted to practice before I sent it to the seller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone could help with these questions I would greatly appreciate it.
    <br/>

    Thank you,

    I don't think anyone will recommend a 3rd party for encrypting you can download the program and the thread you are looking for can be found in the security sub-forums

    I didn't visit your link, but do yourself a favor and just work your way through the guides on these forums to get the proper software. It's really easy. Since i'm bored, I'll run down what i did with my first order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Make sure your name and address are exactly as it should appear on the package shipping label. Vendor will copy / paste it. Encrypt name and address with vendor's public key. Copy resulting outputted code and paste into SR order address box. Place order.
    <br/>
    -Your vendor will receive the encrypted address message and use his public key to decrypt it. Then he'll copy/paste the clear text to a label, print, and stick it on your package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Send your public key to the vendor so he can also send you encrypted messages that only you can read. You could just send your pub key  to him unencrypted I suppose. I was paranoid at the time and used the vendor's public key to encrypt a message containing my public key. Probably unnecessary. Anyway, send it to him in a PM, not the order address window.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -From then on whatever sensitive info you send him you would encrypt with HIS public key. Whatever you receive from him you decrypt with YOUR private key to read it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make sense?  No?  Eh... just read the guides. lol.

    Here il make a lil more easier to understand
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go download yr pgp program and install, i use gpa i think well thats the folder name anyways
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now go to the vendors page and copy and paste the pgp key from the --- to the ---... all of it.
    <br/>
    Put that into a text document on yr pc and save.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    open up pgp and you want to hit import... then import the text doco with the key in it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it should come up with new key found and then be in yr key manager
    <br/>
    <br/>
    go to clipboard and type yr name and addy then hit encrypt and choose the vendors key
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it will then be an encrypted msg that u copy and past in the address box on the order page
    <br/>
    <br/>
    very simple
