    This order was shipped 1st class last Friday, 8/3, and it's now 5 business days later and still no package. This is the first time any piece of mail addressed to this drop has seemingly went missing. Also, today was the first time no mail came at all. The mailbox was empty while everyone else had their bills and junkmail lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question is, has anyone else experienced these delays recently, and can the lack of mail be a sign of some kind of investigation? I realize I'm probably just bugging from not getting my droogs, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

    Where are you shipping from, is it international??

    Customs have stepped up in my home country for 2 months now, don't think it's helping as the user base just grows exponentially with every news article!  8)

    I wouldn't worry too much yet.  I had a package take 13 days to arrive, it was shipped out the next day, and nothing looked out of the ordinary when I got it.  The post office seems to be slacking in their delivery times now.

    Thanks guys. First class mail does indeed seem to be fucking everyone over this week. I am hoping that's what this is, cause today makes 2 DAYS of NO MAIL WHATSOEVER at this address. I have never seen this before, not at the drop, not at home, work, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know this is all probably just an uncanny coincidence, but is it still possible that they're screening my mail for a few days, followed by a CD that includes the seized package along with the rest of the missing mail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: This a domestic order in the US.

    hey sourman,
    <br/>
    you ever get your package?  i'm in a similar situation waiting for a shipment domestically and it's been about a week and getting nervous.  just wondering how your situation ended up.

    I don't know what's going on with USPS but even express mail is taking more than two business days. I think it's because of the huge budget cuts.

    I don't know what's going on, but I ordered some non SR stuff and it got to my mail in 2 days domestic.  Everything I've ordered so far has not arrived, and we're talking small amounts.  1g here, 10-strip there...  I don't know if that's because it got busted at customs but I find it hard to believe a 10 strip of LSD wouldn't make it through unless the vendor was retardedly careless about packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's been about 17-18 days now and still waiting on both orders.

    most likely it's a delay, first-class can be a bitch

    it's not uncommon to see no mail on some days, unless you usually receive lots of mail that there's never a day where you get at least an envelope

    Like everyone mentioned already.  USPS is starting to really show in their lack of consistency and speed due to the payroll cut.  1st class is now fail. Even priority and express is becoming fail.

    Not sure if this has anything to do with anything,  but the US Postal Service is about to be in default for the first time ever,  on a  $ 5. 5 billion dollar loan from the government. I am sure there will be some noticable changes in the coming months.

    That is a little sketchy.  If you have mail that comes almost every day like bills and junk mail and you still haven't got anything, I would say that is very sketchy.  Are you expecting any packages from SR?

    Yeah if it was a small order I wouldn't bug out.  Especially if it was overseas, customs would snag it and maybe send you a love letter.  But that's it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If no mail comes by this Friday I would give your post office a call and ask.  Be like I haven't gotten any mail for like the last two weeks and Im worried about paying bills late or something. Just ask what's up.
