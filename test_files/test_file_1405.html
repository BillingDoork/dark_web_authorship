    Going to order some acid soon. Temperatures are really high though (30 degrees easily). The shipping shouldn't take more than 1-2 days. What are the chances of the LSD being ruined due to these temperatures? Does this happen a lot?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's the best way to transport LSD privately? Just pit it a suitcase between some clothes in some paper where the sun can't reach it? Obviously not going to let the bag sit in the sun.

    I've thought about this before, but I don't think most mail sits in an unairconditioned room for very long. I doubt it would ever be left in the back of a truck overnight, and I'm pretty sure the sorting centers would be air conditioned during the night when nobody is there. What I would be most concerned about is the heat of it sitting in your mail box during the time in which it is dropped off. I don't personally know much about how fast LSD breaks down in heat/light, but I think if you just get it from the mail when it gets delivered, then you will be fine.

    How to transport LSD privately? Commonly suggested way is to keep it in tin-foil, and then put that in a book, or in the refrigerator hidden or something. It's just a sheet of paper with no odor... can't be too hard to conceal.. be creative.

    It will be fine, the greatest risk is LSD on a plane in the area where they store the packages getting to hot.

    Not really all that worried about them finding the LSD, more that it doesn't leak/get too warm. Thanks for the replies guys!

    Keeping LSD in the Fridge with a (dry absorption thing they are in the beef jerky packets?) My only question on this is if you keep it air tight and you have liquid in one of these things can you condense the liquid to make it more potent &amp; less?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, Keeping LSD in a fridge or freezer needs to be in a "dry" freezer but isn't the fridge bad due to condensation?

    Thanks!
