    I got a LL  over 8 months ago from NE. Then things were flowing just fine. Now a package hasn't arrived and I'm sure it's been nabbed. I suppose this means I'm cut off. Thoughts?

    I don't think they would knowingly let you receive deliveries for 8 months after an LL and then decide to intercept your mail again without sending you another LL. Most likely lost/stolen.. If the original LL had been for a great enough amount they would have intercepted further orders and you would have got a knock at the door. They wouldn't have allowed you to receive unhindered for 8 months and then just randomly start taking your mail.. They have to send an LL unless they're planning a controlled delivery.

    They don't always send love letters.   If you got one before, then its still possible packs have gotten through after.  Sometimes its just luck getting the pack through.  But having a LL before...and then possibly getting a pack snagged, could lead to an investigation.

    so this is a 101 questions, but what extent of an investigation. if you have fool of kip order a small g of xtc once catch and now another interception. i'm guessing the two outcomes are a controlled delivery or another LL and I live to fight another day. But investigation wise it's pretty straight forward. Small time buyer caught. What more do they care to investigate?

    The more seizures, the more they will pay attention to that address.   I would stay domestic for awhile...and find another address for int. orders.   They could do a controleld delivery, a LL, a knock and talk, or just nothing.

    Another highly sketchy newcomer asking the wrong questions.  Thoughts?  I think you are phishing.

    th3creeper, this is a forum and a community. i've been here a long time and wanted to raise a question. I stand by the concern and thank the helpful for their feedback. SR stands together for success. Luckily I even checked this post to say all is well and tonight i will be standing on the fucking moon. The only thing I can offer out of this is NE to US is a purchase I never made. Don't plant ice b/c you'll harvest wind. GN all.
