    I am looking to start selling goods on SR, but my only hurdle is how I can anonymously ship larger packages domestically in the US.  As I understand it, I would need to drop the package off inside the Post Office.  That in itself is not a deal breaker as my product isn't drugs, but it is still lesser-illegal merchandise.  The typical box will be up to 12x12x12.  Is there any way to ship via UPS/Fed-Ex/etc. where I can protect myself from exposure to the end client and the watchmen?

    If you choose to use UPS or Fed-Ex then won't the more expensive price of shipping be handed down to your customers? (Sorry can't help with the packaging probelm)  :(

    I would imagine the cost of using a third party carrier would be somewhat comparable to the USPS.  It will still be a good deal for the merchandise with shipping, so I am not worried so much about the cost of the shipping as I am about staying anonymous.

    I understand where you are coming from and really appreciate the input, but I think my product may sell well and the start up risk is very small to me.  Do people not purchase large items because of the risk of larger packages?  Again my product is not drugs, so I have no fear of packages being seized even if the contents are discovered.  The end buyer would also bear miniscule if any risk in receiving my products as it is merely counterfeit consumer items.  To me it seems like this would be very easy to shrug off by saying, "I thought they were real."  Surely even in America we aren't arresting people for getting "scammed" by counterfeit merchandise.

    USPS, FedEx, or UPS are all going to require interaction with a counter person to ship a large package. You can help remain anonymous by printing labels, paying cash, and using a fake name. You can't easily get around them seeing your face.

    pay a poor friend to drop the package off at different locations each time.
    <br/>
    have them pay with cash, and fake names, business names are better
    <br/>
    thats what I would do, although I wouldnt ship a 12 x 12 x 12

    The only other option would be to use a mom and pop type shipping store that you know isn't wired for video.  You can't escape the human interaction but you won't be recorded.

    Thank you everyone for your help.  I like the idea of using independent shipping stores, but will probably combine a few of your suggestions for my final procedure.  I think this is going to move forward in the next couple weeks.  Thanks again!

    UPS/FEDEX/ETC Can open your mail at any time.
    <br/>
    Your best bet is using the automated postal service for stamps and dropping your pack off to them right before posting. If your box fits in the drop box inside you'll be good to dorp it in. If not you'll just have to take it to the desk.
    <br/>
    Of course if you use the automated you better be using someone elses card and not your own, I also like to keep my face hidden while picking up stamps. I wear beanies, fake hair, some glasses that kanye west would approve of. All kinds of stupid shit that makes me look like every other idiot in the area but nothing at all like myself.
    <br/>
    I do this at night, our post office is open 24hrs for electronic stamps.
    <br/>
    This is how I do it and I've sent off well over 1000 packs in the last few months with no issues. Some of them larger but most smaller
