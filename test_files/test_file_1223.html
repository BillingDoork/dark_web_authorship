    So I'm moving in a few days and I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with forwarding addresses in the US.  I've had nothing but successful transactions at my current address.  When I move, I'll get my mail forwarded from my old place to the new in case I forget to update my address on any bills, websites, etc.  Does it make sense for me to get my SR purchases sent to my old place, only to have the USPS forward it to the new?  I figure in case I ever get in trouble with LE, its an extra level of plausible deniability.  I could always say that the new tenants at the old place were using my name, or my old neighbors at the old place knew I moved out and were getting packages shipped there in my name.  Any thoughts on whether this is worth the trouble, or if vendors would have a problem with it?
    <br/>

    Thanks.

    I say hell no!  You can't rely on USPS to forward your mail.  I still get random mail for the previous resident several years later - and not just junk mail either.  You can't trust the new resident to dutifully forward your mail to you if USPS fucks up.  It's pretty likely that the new resident at your old place will throw away mail addressed to you if it's an envelope.  If it's a package they might open it instead of forward it.  Then you HOPE they just steal your purchase rather than alert LE and set you up for a CD or flag your new address.
