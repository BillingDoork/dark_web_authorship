    When having something sent from sr via express mail does the carrier deliver it to the door like normal express mail in the morning or because signature is waived does it get delivered by the normal courier in the mailbox or will the express mail courier put it in the mailbox?

    I think it varies by the carrier. I've had them come to the door twice out of dozens of orders. That was early on, my 1st few orders. I think the express carrier was trying to just be nice more than anything at that point, making sure I got it in time. Once they started seeing a lot of express deliveries, sometimes 3 or 4 a week, none requiring signatures, they started just leaving them in the mailbox. Sometimes more than 1 at a time on the same day.

    It can come in a separate vehicle/courier than your normal carrier(s). Also even with signature waived they often make people sign anyway. The last two express mail items I sent the recipient was prompted to sign even though I waived the signature, and signed it to do so. This could make a CD alot easier for LE if you get used to this mistake by USPS, or don't want to refuse delivery when it comes and you have to sign when you shouldn't.

    Alright thanks.  I have never had a signature waived before or had illegals sent express so I was wondering.  Usually the express lady comes at like 8 in the morning.  Hopefully I dont have to sign.

    when express mail comes to the post office in the morning the accountables clerk will come to the carrier and ask them ARE YOU GOING TO GET THIS EXPRESS MAIL THERE BY 12 NOON OR NOT. IF the carrier says yes he will take THE EXPRESS MAIL out with him and all the other mail. if he is your regular carrier and SIGNATURE IS WAIVED he will 99% of the time just put in your mailbox during the regular journey of his route or he might have to deviate to get the express mail their by 12 noon. in the morning if the carrier says NO i cannot make the express mail by 12 noon the clerk will give all the express mail that cannot be delivered by noon by the individual mailmen..... to a supervisor who will find another carrier maybe a sub to go do an EXPRESSMAIL RUN he will take all these expressmail and deliver them by 12 noon that is why  sometimes you get express mail early in the morning way before you get your regular mail,the carrier doing the EXPRESSMAIL RUN if signature is waived may or may not knock on your door, they may just leave it in your mailbox like your REGULAR CARRIER WOULD.it is up to the individual carrier. remember if the carrier does not see you....more security for you.

    EXPRESS MAIL THROUGH THE US POSTAL SERVICE COULD AND DOES end up being handled by more employees than a regular package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT SEND ANYTHING FROM SILK ROAD AS AN EXPRESS MAIL FOR THIS VERY REASON THE LESS PEOPLE WHO HANDLE THE PACKAGE THE BETTER!!!!!!!!!     LLSR

    Some crazy fools will be doing their jobs so well they won't want to give out an express w/o sign though it's clearly waived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a friend with an "alternate" po guy  who put a slip in the box asking for a sig on a relatively moderately decent bud order who asked for a sig when it was specifically chcked and the sig waive signed. In small towns express at po or in general can seem a little excessive due to cost. After couple days of not signing the guy ended up offering it to the person who did not look like the name very obviously and said well here ya go. No sig needed. But what a hassle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And you try express cause you think well it's JUST EXPRESS! and there are plenty vendors here I'm sure that have no issue all the time with it. I have not personally ever had an issue. But I rarely request express.

    I'm quite certain that the USPS saw a spike in their profits when SR was launched.  I haven't seen the numbers, but if SR went down, do you have any idea how many people would lose their jobs?  Just imagine the MILLIONS of dollars we are contributing to it!  I think it's the cops, not the USPS, that we need to look out for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as Express?  I just lost my faith in it today.  Tried to "Express" an order to the midwest, and after 48 hours went by with no delivery, it was marked "Departing sort facility" four states above the state that was the designated delivery address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My customer happens to be very understanding about it, but it really makes me mad.  As a seller, I want to meet the medication needs of customers.  If someone pays for "Express" they should get "Express" instead of "well it's really a guaranteed 48 hour delivery" or even better yet "Guaranteed , unless we totally fuck up and send it to the wrong state, so then you can come back and get your $20."  So what about my customer?  How are you going to make them feel better?  I now have to work hard to prove my credibility as this situation makes me look like a jerk.  They should either do a better job of delivering, or not sell something they can't deliver.  It's forced me to not be able to "guarantee" 24 hour delivery anymore.

    Yes it seems to be related to the flight connections along the way.  But a person never knows ahead of time, say when one is home and taking an order, whether they can guarantee the delivery within 24 hours.  It makes the vender look like a jerk when the "flights" don't connect right.  I'm considering just offering Priority, as I feel that it's sort of wrong to sell something that I can't deliver.  I feel like there should be a banner somewhere on SR that says "No Priority Express can be guaranteed delivered in 24 hours".

    In my experience, if it is small enough to fit in the mail box and it is express they wont bother coming to the door but larger bulkier items they will either drop it at your doorstep or knock to see if anyone is home. I think when they knock it is just out of courtesy..

    So I have a quick question. Are "priority" and "express" the same thing? I placed an order on Wednesday that I NEED to come today, and I used "Express" shipping. Was told it would arrive in 1-4 days, this is day 3. With Labor day around the corner it would come Tuesday if not today, and that's an issue due to the fact that I sell, and customers are waiting  ::)
