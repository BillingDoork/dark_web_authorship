    Hey guys, just wondering if anyone could go through the risks of bringing in small batches of 5 hits to ch-ina. If i use my own name on the package, do i have plausible deniability? Also, how detectable is lsd as opposed to other substances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last but not least does anyone know of any SR merchants in Ch-ina?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    HAHAHA, 5 blotter in an envelope carry a 0.0000000001% chance of being detected. Even a full page will be hard to detect. Don't worry  ;D 5 blotters is nothing, seriously.

    Maybe superviewsrx was suggesting you should order non-printed blotter instead of printed blotter?
    <br/>
    Printed blotter upon inspection is much more suspicious than non-printed blotter.

    Yeah, blotters are sooo small, and if you conceal them well, I don't think they would be able to be detected. If you want to be extra extra safe, go for white unperforated blotter. It'll just look like you have a small strip of white paper if someone finds it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't worry too much about it. Though I've never been to China, so I don't know how tough security is. I really don't think you should be too worried though.

    Good luck!

    I would think blotter would be one of the easiest to get in. In the middle of a wallet perhaps?  I wouldn't think body heat would break it down to much if you put it deep in your wallet

    Oxygen and UV break down LSD, the hotter it gets the quicker these reactions begin to occur. Heat by itself is a marginal factor, in fact there was a vile of crystal kept at varying temperatures reaching far above above room temperature for over 20 years with nearly no loss of potency. Of course it was in a sealed amber vial.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as penalty, LSD is probably one of the worst you can get caught with, there have been raids for tiny personal amounts. Luckily its one of the easiest to get shipped, if the shipper is smart it can be hidden well, sadly most SR vendors ship it in ways if anyone opened the package it would be blatantly obvious it was a blotter of some substance. White or printed if there is a tiny strip of thick white paper in a ziplock or vac sealed you'd have to be a moron not to know what it is. Right now there are a lot of scams going around, and I know nothing of china's import regulations, I'd wager to guess they are pretty rigid.

    The chance of getting caught is very low but is it worth the risk of like 5 years in a prison?

    Thanks raven for clarifying.

    I don't know of any vendor in china with lsd and ravens right most of the trips I've received had no stealth. My blind granny could open the envelope and know there's some shit in there that gets you high.
    <br/>
    One of my favorite vendors for stealth is Buddha Nature, he doesn't supply lsd but supply's very clean dmt and his psilocin "shroom pills" are pretty nifty as well

    If you really need acid wait for 3 jane to return she had outstanding acid packaging.

    Does anyone have any recommendations for vendors? Also is there any unprinted blotter on SR? I had a good look around but didnt find anything. Appreciate all the advice.
