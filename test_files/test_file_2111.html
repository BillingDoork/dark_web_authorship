    Welcome to SR!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im glad I got here first to save you from the potential proverbial wolves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The long and short of it mate is that you will have a VERY hard time finding anyone who would tell you the details to these questions you ask.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For all anyone knows you are filling out your paper work from your last round of traffic stops right now, waiting for someone to reply to this thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll be the first to admit it IS hard starting out as a new legit vendor because no one will give you an answer and you dont want to make a "wrong move".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Above all else protect your self and your anonymity. That is paramount. Beyond that you are gonna have to figure out enough on your own really to get started.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is what I recommend. These shipping questions you have, try them out. Before I put anything in the mail I had a good friend allow me to send him test packages. Packages with inert contents, but using different methods, to see if anything didn't make it to the other end etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that said Read this if you haven't It will explain a lot:

    I think it depends greatly upon what you are trying to ship.  Will it smell, or make sounds?  It is called stealth shipping for a reason.  Be creative.
