    I have successfully created and tested working tracking labels that I myself printed at home. I am, however, facing an internal struggle.

    <br/>
    For the greater good of the community, and to the benefit of both the buyer and seller, I want to get this into the hands of only those who need to know. I was planning on posting the PDF guide I made detailing the method  in the vendors round table, but the realization dawned on me, that someone would just steal it and sell it for $10 to every person who was willing to pay. It's the part that anyone and everyone could purchase, resulting in the loop hole being sealed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't really feel like keeping it to myself would benefit anyone. I know several small vendors are having trouble getting anonymous tracking.

    This is something I'd be very interested in! Shit, I'd pay the 10 bucks just to get some pointers in this department! Would love to see this PDF of yours... 8)

    I think posting it in the vendor's forum's a good idea and put the caveat in that if anyone sees anyone selling the info on then to have a gentlemen's agreement in place that people should tip you off? It's awesome if it really works and will continue to do so.

    You thought up a genius fake-tracking number method??? And sending schedule 1 compounds with them even??? Thanks for informing me, I'll never buy from you ever! It can't be long until the USPS discovers which packages they aren't getting paid for tracking, and I definitely won't be a part of the fallout when they do!!!

    You're an idiot. Never once have I sent any ones package with a made label. Also, I don't "generate" these numbers out of thin air. They are already created by the USPS. Slap these labels on a priority package like your suppose to, have no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tracking with priority is free. Next time, don't comment until you know something.

    Not post or give at all. Want to be a vendor you should be smart and think outside the cube. If you do that there are many ways to get tracking and ship discreetly. One that cannot think of that maybe not be vending? Sharing the information will only make it be useless.

    Agreed. I'm very glad you thought this out before just blindly posting it. Sometimes sharing info can be much worse than withholding it. I truly hope you benefit from your discovery, friend. Good luck.
