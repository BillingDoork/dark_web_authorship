    Anyone ever lose a usps package and have them do a trace on it? I realize that if it were to somehow be opened I wouldnt have a leg to stand on legally but it is a very small amount of pills so Im willing to take the risk. Also the seller has very good stealth packaging. Ive heard of people receiving express packages months later after some postal worker happened across it but I would like to get it sooner rather than later. Anyone have any luck doing this?

    I doubt express packs in USA domestic can arrive months later.
    <br/>
    If tracking does not update on the day its supposed to be delivered (for exaple its supposed to arrive at 12:00pm guaranteed but if tracking updates during the day or next morning) you are good to go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS has delays sometimes, I had like 7 or 8 packs that were in lbs take 2 days to arrive. At first we were freaking out because it didnt come the day it was supposed to, but it just got delayed and came second day. Thats why we only worry if the package hasnt arrived the 2nd day. If package hasnt arrived the 2nd day, its been confisacted

    Well the package shipped last monday(1-14) and it still hasnt arrived. The vendor went ahead reshipped and that package arrived in a day. He said that when he looked up the first package that there wasnt any information on it.

    that means the first package has been seized. Even though the second one made it, the first one is caught. It is highly unlikely it has been lost. If it was lost and after a week, dogs will be able to smell your gears even if vaccum sealed more than 3. you should expect a love letter in a few weeks, just ignore it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    did you get the tracking at all? if you did, you should check it. if you didnt get tracking but he had checked tracking, its possible that he has not sent it and just delayed it for you

    The vendor reshipped at his own cost so I dont know why he would be "delaying it for me". He also assured me that LE didnt pick up my package as this has happened to him many times before because usps is careless. I dont have the tracking number for it yet but i asked him for it just now. Also this is a domestic package and his packaging is very stealthy and hes never lost a package to LE. Not saying you are wrong in this assumption but I just find it hard to believe.

    I once had an express package disappear. I even called USPS to inquire about what to do (it was an expensive fuckin package) and they basically said therebvwas nothing i could do but it would probably showup eventually. It did show 2 days later and then they called me 2 days after that to tell me they located my package. Better late than never!
