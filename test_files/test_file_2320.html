    I can't imagine not doing this. Fingerprints everywhere! I need to get a good pair of "stylish" but skintight gloves to work with. Latex gloves are good  for preparing orders, but prove to be very suspicious during actual postal box drops.

    Found my answer in the search engines, yes, most vendors do use gloves during most of the process. Feel free to continue discussing here, though. I believe I am going to be purchasing some armor all / batting gloves to use for drops!

    Ive heard that some recommend applying "liquid bandage" on their fingertips before making drops... Gloves are obviously best for minimizing trace evidence, but look a little suspicious during warmer seasons.

    LOL.. can you imagine gloves on in the middle of july.. too funny..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for real tho.. packing with gloves on sucks!!! Tape sticks to gloves.. stamps stick to gloves its a real mess..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last week tho after ripping at least 7 gloves at the fingers because of packing tape I had an idea.. I put on the gloves and then rapped band-aids over the finger tips..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BOY OH BOY.. did that ever help! no more ripping gloves for me..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as for dropping mail.. I normally have all my mail in a bag and just empty the bag into the mail box.. no golves, nothing needed.. just make sure you dont drop the bag in.

    A small amount of white glue - enough to even out the whorls of your fingerprints - should also work. And it's easy to remove, and dries relatively clear.

    And folks, don't forget to change your gloves during every step of packaging (or going to the bathroom).

    C-O-N-T-A-M-I-N-A-T-I-O-N!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And don't use latex gloves, you can still possibly transfer your fingerprints because of how thin they are.

     As long as there isn't any fingerprint inside the pack, you're good to go. Too many people touch the box during the shipping process, it'd make it completely useless in an investigation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     macdrizzle: Not true my friend. The first thing postal inspectors do is take pictures of the the seized pack and then dust it for fingerprints all over the inside and outside. It's not to be taken lightly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     for grabbing postal supplies and stamps, handling things while INSIDE the post office, liquid band aid or just don't use the ones you touch... example, grab a stack of DCN stickers, don't use the top and bottom ones that get touched. Don't get your palm prints on anything either. Even if you haven't had your fingerpints ever taken, you may at some point in the future, then they could link you to the old packs and charge you over them or investigate more. and these days if you get arrested in a large enough populated area, they scan your entire hands, palm and everything. That goes to the FBI and prolly homeland security. Maybe non-US vendors don't have to care so much, but one day you will. Better to start best practices now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     for stamps, it you're buying say Priority Mail $4.95 stamps, buy 20 or more at a time. Usually the PO employee will give them to you a wax paper envelope. I guess cuz they're collectors items? dunno. For first class stamps, you can usually buy them at a drug store or grocery store. Buy something else and have a bag for your other stuff. Ask for stamps and just hold the bag out. The clerk will drop them in your bag. wink
     <br/>
     <br/>
     for packaging... form fitting gloves, many a folk likes the blue nitrile ones with bumps on the fingertips. multi-layers is better of course.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     for dropping off, put the stamped packs all in a LARGE envelope, those brown ones are good. stick the envelope half way into the collection box with the open end down in there. Shake. Stamped packs fall out of your large envelope into the blue bin. Keep hold of the large brown envelope until all packs fall out. Don't drop that in. Then pull it out and put it back in bag / backpack / car / whatevs and save it for next time. This way you don't look shady as fuck walking up to a mail collection box wearing gloves and you don't have irritating liquid bandage crap on your hands."

     Instead of a large [like 15" x 12" or bigger] brown envelope, I've found it more convenient, more durable, way cheaper (free!) and very appropriate looking to use a 15" x 12" tyvek USPS priority/express mail "envelope" for this. They tough as nails, can't be torn. Grab a handful of these off the stack next time you're at a post office. They're free.
