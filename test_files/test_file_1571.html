    So someone in England, finds SR, orders some packages, everything is right with the world.... Everything is encrypted and secure, but has anyone had a visit from the police for drugs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone with experience of UK drug policy (i.e. been busted) comment on how risky the following is?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ordering to own house, in own name, some from UK, couple from NL. Small amounts like 3g speed, 1g MDMA, 1g coke, are expected amounts. Deny ordering anything if asked. Using drop address not possible. Make an order every month or so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I imagine the risk is, a package is found at customs or the PO, and the address is flagged. Said person could get a knock on the door because they suspect drugs at the address. They could come with a warrant, and find "personal use" of various drugs, scales.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this always going to court? Is it a big fine for possession, or worse? Person is a "professional" in a career, with no previous law matters.

    So much SWIM, I feel like I'm on drugs-forum
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But seriously 1 gram will probably just get your address flagged and a "love letter" in most countries. Now if you get an 8-ball or more, that is a different story.

    You're already risking a lot by ordering three things from two countries for your first order.
