    It's not a secret, that in a lot of countries postman never deliver packages to the address. Instead of it, post-office send notification and receiver should go to the post-office himself to take his package. He should have his docs to get package. If package contains stuff and customs found it, coming out from the post-office with his package, receiver will be met by policemen.
    <br/>
    In such countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, maybe China post system works this disadvantageous way and in my point of view it's quiet dangerous to use simple national post to order stuffs.

    What's your opinion about EMS and  Fedex?

    the only problem i have with fedex is it the USA is that if you are shipping to a po box they can not put it in it legally so it gets lost, thrown out, or send back to sender

    Another downside to FedEx in the US is that they don't need a warrant to open packages.  That is why USPS is the suggested way to ship.

    I get EMS orders all the time when I order from an online pharmacy from India and they seem to go through all the time, I even get tracking which is pretty cool. I've used Fedex as well before when USPS wasn't an option (rarely) and had no problem. As CapnJack pointed out, they don't need a warrant to open your package like USPS does but it's not like they're opening every package out of curiosity. Your package has to be flagged in order to be searched, so if your package looks good and you vacuum seal your product and conceal it then you should be fine but I would obviously still go with USPS.

    If you are ordering international ... there really is only 1 difference between EMS/Fedex/UPS/USPS and thats mail volume.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The warrant thing is only applicable for domestic packages .. customs can open anything they want for any reason they feel.

    People use all shipping services with few reports of interception, USPS is by far the most popular and widely thought to be the most secure option though.

    i'm having drinks with a guy today who has a friend that works for fed ex as a suspicious package investigator and i'm not sure what they've done but they've done something before, i'd just like to know that if it clears customs he could tell me if anything goes awry. i would like to get packages with fake names sent to an address, and if he tells me they know whats in it then i simply don't acknowledge that i know what it is. or i could also see if it didn't clear customs and i could just know.
