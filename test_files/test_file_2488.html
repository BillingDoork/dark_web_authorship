    Express mail is TYPICALLY a separate truck. Also, it's either BY 12pm or BY 3pm depending on where you live.
    <br/>
    That being said... it's 'guaranteed' overnight... notice the quotes. Unless the vendor walked into the post office and handed it directly to a person so they could scan the package/envelope in, it will most likely take 2 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not to mention there isn't a post office in the country that is open at 7am... so it's I can almost 'guarantee' you it will take 2 days.

    and has shipped to my area before, and said that it takes only one day.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    We ship a fair amount of overnight packages... but I suppose mileage can vary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why exactly are you going to be 'shitting bricks'? Domestic packages have virtually a 0% chance of failed delivery... unless the vendor is a fucktard.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as your question - depends on what the seller did. Did they check the box to 'Waive Signature'? If so, the mail guy will stick it in your box if it fits. Or they may leave a notice saying you need to go pick it up at the post office. If the vendor didn't waive the signature... you will have to sign for it (surprise, surprise).

    okay. true.

    <br/>
    i am shitting bricks because i have to receive it tomorrow, because the following day i leave early for 4 days. =/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i highly doubt i would have to sign. that would be silly, huh. this guy is experienced over 120 transaction 100% feedback
    <br/>
    <br/>
    interesting stuff though! thanks for the help
    <br/>

    Doesn't exactly seem to qualify as a 'shitting bricks' situation as that would imply someone being scared. But to each their own :P
