    So I'm going to a festival and want to bring a small amount of pills/powder for personal use. How should I bring them? I'm thinking about just putting them out in the open in some weekly vitamin container mixed in with some real vitamins, would that work? Or should I just bring only powder in a capsule bottle mixed with vitamins that look exactly the same? So far these two are my only options as I have no way to mail to the hotel or to someone in the area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas/comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

    Yep ship it in the mail, never take a plane with drugs on you... You may stress too much and LE are trained to detect that. I don't say that you will get popped but it is a too high risk to take, did you enjoy your liberty? If you get arrested you will learn that liberty is priceless..

    10 years of prison ? It depend from country to country but usually they can put on you several chiefs of accusation like traficking, drug importation, etc
    <br/>
    2 gram of MDMA may not be a big amount for you but i think LE will tell that it's like 20 pills of ecstasy for a X value (ex: 250 $) you have never seen those documentaries of people importing coke from Peru or other country like that?

    I second the other wise advice on here. Don't take it on your person on a plane. Mail to yourself. Pay a runner to carry through. Buy it when you're there. Drugs are everywhere if you know who to ask. Especially at festivals. Your very last avenue should be carrying it through some of the most secure areas on the planet. You are risking your freedom. There are very few things worth risking your freedom for...and none of them are psychoactive chemicals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you think it's unavoidable, weigh up the pros and cons, research the laws of your departure and arrival countries and get an understanding of their detection procedures. Understand the drug you're smuggling with regards to it's detection ability by x-ray, canines etc. Meth is easily detectable by dogs. Tryptamines not so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fully decontaminate prior to leaving. Dogs will smell the drugs on your clothes, personal effects etc well before they smell them on you. Shower/wash/scrub until you have no skin left. Take 1mg of alprazolam 1 hour before and after both departure and arrival. Breathe, chat and banter. Act yourself. Buy an overpriced coffee. Blend in (tourist) or show strength (uberbusy businessman). Don't be a search target. Don't give them an excuse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And for the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster...don't try and mask your drugs with another scent. Rather try and reduce their ability to disperse into the air and onto your personal effects using triple membrane bags and proper decontamination procedures. If it's a small airport, send some scruffy-looking grouped clean-runners through 20 people ahead with a topical anaesthetic smeared on their skin at dog nose level to cause false positives, piss of the handlers...and tie up resources. Dogs are expensive. Airports don't have many. Humans are everywhere...and they tend to be good at understanding other humans. They do it for a living. Assume you are being profiled until the moment you leave.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And lastly, remember that if you go down this route and you are caught you have absolutely no plausible deniability. The drugs are on YOU. It is obvious YOU were trying to hide them. YOU will be going to jail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace

    Im in full agreement with everyone else in saying that it really isnt worth it.  Especially if youre going to a festival, you will find drugs, and will likely find good drugs.  Sure they may be a little price gouged, but that extra $20 is worth the security of having virtually 0% chance of getting arrested versus a high more likely outcome if you attempt to smuggle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If, still, you must, I suggest OTC medication bottles in checked luggage, particularly if you can get a small bottle (such as alieve).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, has anyone else ever accidentally brought drugs on a plane?  I was flying home from a festival once and somehow (foolishly) forgot that I had around 1.5g of (amazing) bud in my carry on backpack.  I couldn't believe it when I went to take out a piece of gum on the plane and found myself holding a fat sack of nug.  Sure was happy when I got home though :D

    Brought a few grams of weed through airports a few times, but this was before the intense security upgrades post-9/11.

    Yea, I'd say either ship it or leave it.  I have a buddy who tried to take some stuff with him on a plane, got caught, and was facing five years in jail.  Barely got off but trust me, that is not the kind of shit you want to be facing.

    If you have a powder-form drug like MDMA, you can put it in capsules from another prescription you have. When I take my daily Adderall XR, I save the orange capsules. I then fill the  capsules with MDMA and bring those on the plane.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've also put a bunch of clear MDMA capsules in a bag along with vitamins and other over-the-counter meds, and I've never been questioned. Almost everyone has some kind of pill in their carry-on, especially when you think about over-the-counter meds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It also helps if you're in a  busy airport. The TSA agents are trained to look for bombs and other suspicious things, not drugs. Although some marijuana in a Ziploc would be VERY east to distinguish, so don't do something dumb like that!

    TSA actually request you put your prescription medication in a bag and not label them.  They were having some problems with people confiscating medications.  I took a bag with about 25 addy mixed with some ibuprofen and naproxen.  I also got selected for the full body scan one time.  Had a 10 strip in my pocket.  They asked me to ensure my pockets were empty.  Took the 10 strip out (only thing in pocket, security watching), placed it in the bin, proceeded through checkpoint, placed 10 strip back in pocket.  Tripped face later.

    I carry pills on me through the airport all the time.  Of course, they are prescription pills (though not prescribed to me).  I put them in a bottle that was prescribed to me and toss it in my carry on bag.  Unless you are carry a shit ton of pills, TSA isn't going to check the pills to make sure they match the prescription on the bottle.  I've had TSA look through my bag, pull out the bottle and glance at it.  It had my name on it and they moved on without cracking it open.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for powder...I dunno.  Put it up your bum would be safe.  Put it in a baby powder bottle and tuck it in your toiletry bag.
