    I know this is far away, but next year I want to go to Tomorrowland in Belgium. My original thoughts were to buy normal tickets and arrive in Belgium a week early, having 'mail' sent to my hotel in time for the festival. However, chances of getting the standard tickets are low as they sell out super fast, but the travel packages do not. Travel packages include flights out of another European city, to Belgium. I'm assuming things will be really expensive inside, and I don't know whats really in them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What would be the best way of organizing the goods? I don't like the idea of carrying on planes. Maybe still better to have it sent to a hotel in Belgium and pick it up when I arrive, even though I wont be arriving a few days beforehand?

    Apparently they sell the tickets are the door. Thats what happened this year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldÂ  probably land in NL or GER. Stay there few days, order ur pills. so many pill vendors in these 2 countries. Then eurotrain it to Belgium and stay there for tomorrowland

    gna be a nice change from reading, also id suggest maybe sending it to a post restante in belgium picking up from there with your passport then going straight to the festival.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thats my plan anyway.
    <br/>
    Cant fucking wait

    How fucking wicked would it be if there was a SR area? It makes me sad that we can't meet.

    A trip together could become one of the most intense/interesting experiences in our life.

    Ahah thanks for the replies.

    <br/>
    Landing early in the EU has been the plan so far. If I miss out on normal tickets, I'll just grab a travel pack and not take the incoming flight - no biggie. What is security like at the venue? I've heard it's sometimes just a show of force at the gate, with maybe a bag search and pat down if you look dodgy enough.

    If I understand correctly, it means sending mail to the local post shop and you pick it up from there by showing ID.

    That's exactly what you can do, although i dont see any problem with you ordering from dam i doubt mail from NL to belgium is scrutinized much as theres no border control etc
    <br/>
    <br/>
    be cheaper and danker that way

    Tomorrowland looks fucking amazing! I've done Ibiza a few times and had an amazing time but the sheer size and scale of that event is just mind blowing. You will be able to score any drug imaginable there I am sure, but if you wanted to arrive early just order to where you are staying, def avoid taking anything through airports that's for sure!!
