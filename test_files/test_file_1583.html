    I'm not even sure how an address can be expressed in a different language, aside from translations of "street", etc. In that case just use the local street name. Use "Rue Clemenceau" and not "Clemenceau Road", "Hundstrasse" and not "Hund Street". English would look strange if the package is traveling between two non-English countries.

    Whatever makes your package look exactly like every other package in the delivery stream should be the standard. SR is successful because of the ability to make packages containing drugs blend into to postal delivery system. LE can't investigate or open even a tiny percentage of the millions (billions) of packages being delivered, so if yours looks pretty much just like every other package you're golden.

    English and French are the international postal languages.  All post offices everywhere in the world are supposed to be able to cope with a package addressed in either of these two languages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are shipping from a country which is neither English speaking nor French speaking to a country that speaks a language different from the language spoken in your country then it is best to use English or French.

    <br/>
    If you are shipping from a country which is neither English speaking nor French speaking to a country that speaks a language the same as the language spoken in your country then it is best to use the language which is common between the two countries.
    <br/>

    If the buyer is from a country which is neither English speaking nor French speaking and the buyer has specifically given you their PGP encrypted address in bilingual format (English or French + native language) then you should address it bilingually.

    It's always best to write the address in the language of the destination country. Afterall, the postman over there is the one who has to read the address and deliver it. He's the one that has to understand it. On its way to the destination country only "country" and "city" are important.

    I always write my address in the language which is spoken in my country! Never had problems! I order also only within EU and over 70 orders arrived safe! Important is that you ALWAYS write your COUNTRY at least of your address like Netherlands,Germany,United Kingdom,and so on......that's very important! And also  look twice in the address field, because if you have a failure maybe your neighbor  get your stuff, this could be really bad if it is a bigger order! Regards
