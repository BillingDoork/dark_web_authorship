    So if I were to use USPS (obviously most usually do (or) should)
    <br/>
    Anyway, if I were to Ship out a package it's pretty fool proof.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was just wondering what do most put as the return address on their packages.? Thanks.

    It's really not as 'fool proof' as you'd think. Are you going to use blue boxes? Take it into the post office? Going to print postage using gift cards/anonymous debit, buy postage at the post office using, or get metered postage from a machine? How many different locations are you going to use? How far are you going to travel? If you travel, your 'return address' should probably reflect the location you're dropping off in..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping is easily the WEAK LINK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as your original question. Most vendors, in our experience, use a real address/business as to not raise suspicion... just not something they're tied to. Meaning that if a package is returned, you [the vendor] still lose the package.

    I'd rather not answer those questions for an extra step of my security ;) but I can say I have high hopes everything will ride smoothly.
