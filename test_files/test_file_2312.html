    Hey dudes,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So i got some epic cookies from this dude in EU. He sent them in 3 packages. I received the first 2 (one was opened by customs and they had put a brochure inside describing customs procedure blah blah. However the 3rd package never turned up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway the other day I got a love letter from customs, basically it says to call them since they can't identify whats in the package. They described it as "Other therapeutics", and basically they said to call them within 30 days to get it released.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm just wondering is it worthwhile? These cookies are pretty damn amazing but it seems as though customs are getting onto me, since they are aware of 2/3 of the packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what to do? All help is appreciated.
    <br/>

    I wouldn't do it. They probably know exactly what is in the cookie.
    <br/>
    And 2 out of 3 is reasonable.

    Not sure if you've read the many other threads on love-letters, but the advise is ALWAYS, do NOT respond to them. Like, ever.

    Learn to make your own cookies.
    <br/>
    You will glad you did.
    <br/>
    It's all in making the butter,.
    <br/>
    It's hard for me to use $350 on ounce pot to make butter but they say because it's going through your liver you get a better bang for the buck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pretty strange, I have been search by customs, looking for weed (I think).
    <br/>
    They went right past the cookies, I use then all the time when I can't bring something with me.
    <br/>
    Why would they tag cookies? There is more to this story.

    Cheers guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    probably will just ditch it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @uniwiz Cheers for the advice dude. The reason I order edibles, is because they are better then anything I can make here (only can get average hydro indica here, where as I love sativa to death) Plus these cookies are by far the best edibles I've ever had. Like actually, I gave one to my friend who slept for 36 hours straight (no joking) so they were pretty darn magical cookies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @zerostate I'm from Australia, so if you are found with under 2oz of dank, then you will only get a $100 fine or something.

    You fight customs for those cookies, I guarantee they have them tested. Then what? You are fucked. That's what. ;-)

    Let 'em go.

    By responding, you would be admitting that you have knowledge of the package and contents.  If they have opened it and you have received a love letter, then they have tested it and are hoping the receiver is a dumb ass and responds.
