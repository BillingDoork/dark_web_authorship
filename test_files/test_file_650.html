    Why is it always down to the customer to prove non-receipt of a package? Iv had a couple of domestic, uk, deliveries no show recently. I had a bit of bother recently and wasn't able/didn't think to check on here to extend or resolve  the issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will admit that some of the vendors were understanding when i explained my circumstances and agreed a 50% reship, and in some case a full reship!! Never received anything yet, but big up to them if i do! I'll even name them and thank them publicly if they don't mind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, i have been asked for a notice of seizure also, which i have never had! This is domestic UK remember. This implies two things to me- 1) The vendors packaging is so poor that a postie is able to identify a package and steal it for them self, or 2) The vendor never sent the package in the first place knowing that they will get some of, if not all of, the coin for nothing. Iv read through some of the feed back for the vendors and this seems to be a recurring theme for some, but not all i don't think, of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When i was asked for notice of seizure i asked for proof of postage, for which there was no answer. So think what you like.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I understand that vendors may not like this. Im not interested in causing arguments, but i just think that it is unfair to put all the emphasis on customers with decent purchasing stats to prove a negative, when it could easily be a selective scam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts or discussion anyone?

    If there's no proof of posting then SR will not automatically award 100% to the vendor, so it's not always down to the customer :)
    <br/>
    when you say you "had a bit of bother recently and wasn't able/didn't think to check on here to extend or resolve  the issue." does that mean you let the orders auto finalize?

    ^Yeah, let go to Auto Finalize unfortunately. However there are worse things that can happen in life. This thread explains my position at the time -

    ^^Tracking was not an option, in fact was refused on one of the items that did not arrive!! I do get tracking if its not too expensive or from over seas, but domestic UK to UK!?! I never seem to loose letters telling me i owe people money, lol. Also, paid for tracking and special next day delivery for 2 items from same vendor which didn't come for a week and were in the same package! Bit unfair and no direct recourse for that either. Packaging was shit too!!

    If you pay for tracking and next day delivery and you don't get it then you can go to resolution. SR will back you every time if you don't get what you pay for, but just chalking it up to experience helps no one but the vendor.

    I did complain to the vendor before i finalized the order. They said they would refund the postage. However, nothing yet! keep sending little reminders for which i get no reply. I do however get messages from them about their new lines and product. Selective reading i guess, lol! Might just have to put that down to experience, but you never know, and take your advice in the future.  ;)
