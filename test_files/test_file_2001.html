    Can you take a few grams of coke and put it in a vial of acetone or grain alcohol and ship it that way?  The recipient would then filter it and extract all the washed product.  Seems like it would not get detected in that manner.

    This is a very bad idea, you would get busted and charged for the weight of the acetone+cocaine instead of just coke and it would take up a lot more space. Just vacuum seal washed coke and you can easily fit a 1/2o in a normal letter no problem and it will just feel like a thick piece of paper like a flier you might be given at a club.

    I guess my thought was that a powder can be easily identified, and might be picked up as anthrax or something, while a liquid would likely pass all detection.  Just an idea.

    A friend of a friend apparently while holidaying in the Caribbean dissolved the coke in water and then soaked their towels in the solution and left them to half dry, bagged them up and brought them through customs..

    This is correct. Liquids in the mail are scrupulously checked by postal workers and customs because of the threat of liquid explosives by terrorists, they are particularly stringent in the U.S because of 9/11 and 7/7. The only viable way to ship drugs in liquid form is doing it for trafficking amounts and even this is fairly difficult and it takes months to prepare the set up needed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stick it in the mail like an ordinary letter. It will be fine. Rule number 1 is don't try and think of complex ways to do things that are already simple to do, when you try and be clever when you don't have the experience to be clever then you end up getting nicked and that certainly isn't clever.
