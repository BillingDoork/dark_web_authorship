    Placed my first order. Currently my order status is 'processing' and there is no option to finalize early (there is an 'Auto Finalize' box, but only an 'N/A' option).
    <br/>
    I'm wondering what the next step will be and how my 'orders' page will change? The seller will mark the package 'in transit' and I'm guessing that is when the finalize early option will appear? What should I be doing now other than patiently waiting?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the help!

    You're right, nothing you can do now but wait! Vendors are busy people and unless it is something urgent, then no need to contact them at this time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once the selling accepts the order and marks it shipped, you will be able to finalize. May this be the first of many purchases!

    The sellers profile page suggest that first time buyers FE as a sign of an 'olive branch'. What are your thoughts on this?

    Depends. What is an acceptable amount of money for you to lose? Where possible don't FE.

    I'm a newbie myself as far as purchasing. Just placed my first yesterday, actually. I have however been lurking for months and consumed a large part of these forums. The order I placed required FE for a special price. Even though it's my first go, and I'd read not to ever FE many times, I'd read of the vendor and was personally comfortable with FE for him. Especially since I had zero transaction history, I even partially chose that listing just as a show of good faith to a reputable vendor. From what i gather, the large majority you should never FE. If you do your homework on your vendor you can gather whether they can be trusted or not. Of course nobody can ever truly be trusted, but you can diminish your risk with a little leg work. If the vendor wasn't proven pretty reputable in my opinion, I never would have FE. Even if your chosen vendor is reputable, as said before, only FE what you can afford to lose.

    Unfortunately finalizing early is a fact of life for new buyers on SR.Â  But if you follow a few rules, you'll be fine:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Only FE on small orders (dollar amounts you can afford to lose).
    <br/>
    2) Avoid FE whenever possible.
    <br/>
    3) Avoid FE whenever possible.

    As others said, FE only if you are dealing with amounts of money you think you can lose. However, I would suggest to use only vendors who offer delivery with tracking. Usually that option is very costly, so it makes sense only when ordering large amounts, but at least you have proof that the product was shipped and you can see where it is going. If you choose tracking you may be able to negotiate FE out of the transaction. Having tracking helps the both parties.
