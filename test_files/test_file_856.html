    Can anyone post stories from their experience or link me to news articles about police investigative techniques in relation to the interception of packages by customs, preferable bulk amounts? I think we could all learn from each other.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here are some examples I know about, I'm gonna be vague about some details to protect my identity obviously:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Scenario 1:
    <br/>
    Person was having Mephedrone sent to their home address, always more than 200grams in each package. They woke up one day to a raid and were questioned about importing Mephedrone. They pleaded ignorance and nothing was found in the raid and no computers at the house were checked. Before the police left they told the guys to contact them immediately if any packages arrived. 2 days later when leaving the house a guy noticed a package sticking out of the mailbox, which was obviously his Mephedrone. Fearing a set-up he contacted the police immediately who came and took it away. No further action was taken by the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Scenario 2:
    <br/>
    2 packages containing more than 100grams each of MDMA were intercepted to a persons address. The police raided the address and questioned the person about the packages and about their recent trip to Europe (indicating the police had done some background checking on the person) and about whether they knew the person the packages were addressed to. The person pleaded ignorance. A VERY thorough search was conducted for more than 2 hours and the occupant of the house was charged with possessing Viagra without a prescription (2 pills were found) but no further charges were made.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Scenario 3:
    <br/>
    A KG of MDMA was split into 20 packages and sent to Australia over the course of a month, to 8 different addresses. 6 of the packages never arrived and 2 of the addresses were visited by the police. One of the addresses was a business and the owner was questioned but no search was conducted. The other address had an elderly person living there who was politely questioned but no search was conducted. No charges were made.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Scenario 4:
    <br/>
    2 pill presses were ordered from Ebay from different buyers and sent to 2 addresses. Both addresses were visited by the police less than 14 days later and the occupants were questioned about buying pill presses. Neither houses were searched and the occupants of both houses pleaded ignorance and no charges were made.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As you can see I've never actually heard of a controlled delivery happening in Australia, they seem to just make a raid but it's obvious they do attempt to do some research first on the person they are going to be raiding. The lesson to learn from this is to always keep your house completely clean when importing large amounts of drugs and plead ignorance no matter what the police tell you.

    You here about them from time to time in the news. Generally they swap the drugs then do a controlled delivery if its going to a syndicate they will get the first guys in the chain then attempt to get the guys further up the chain.Â  Iis fairly standard practice for the AFP.

    I wonder if they would bother with CD if you are using your real name and your home address. I mean, at that point they know who you are wouldn't they just drop in for a chat?
