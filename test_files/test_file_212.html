    I've been on SR for just over a month now and it has been quite an education especially when it comes to navigating the forums. It is probably my growing cynicism that has made me more acutely aware of the sheer number of fucking annoying posts by people who do not know their arse from their elbow and disclose so much sensitive information in their posts they might as well be on the AFP payroll.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are new to SR, please for the sake of us all follow these simple basis steps and hopefully we will all be able to enjoy this market place a bit longer:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) READ READ READ!! don't be a lazy bastard and start new threads for things that have already been discussed to death, search the forums and do your own research before asking stupid fucking questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) Do not announce to the world who is getting their stuff through into your country with a wonderfully detailed description of the packaging techniques, if you want info PM people and ask, if they think you are legit they will share. Posting detailed info only helps LE and scammers, if I read one more post asking for info on success rates I am going to lose my shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3) You're new to buying drugs on the net, ok I get it, it can be quite anxiety provoking especially if you are worried your mum and dad are going to open your mail and bust you, here is the best advice I can think of... if you are underage GTFO!! and if you are worried about your order NO the feds are NOT coming to kick down your door for a tab of acid or half a g of whizz, they have bigger fish to fry! understand the risks, take precautions and stop posting panicking threads asking if you are now on a watch list because your eighth of weed never turned up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If everyone started following these rules it would make SR a safer place for everyone, take it or leave it, neg karma me if you want I couldn't give a fuck, karma only exists in the real world, not in anonymous dark net websites selling drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace 8)

    I can't give you any karma but I can give you a hug &amp; say thanks.

    Yes, I'm new but I spent weeks learning &amp; studying &amp; cussing my computer before I bought anything. What samesamebutdiffernt said is true, you need to READ, READ, READ because stupidity &amp; ignorance puts everyone here at risk - EVERYONE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any of you here to make a purchase on the same day that you join, please don't unless you're already an IT, PGP &amp; Bitcoin genius.  If you don't know what those things are that would be the ignorance referenced above &amp; the stupidity part of the equation is about to kick in.  Not trying to insult anyone - just sayin' slow down, think, read, learn &amp; stay out of jail, eh?  Thank you :-*

    Think we are seeing an influx of peeps who don't want to read, or learn or stay safe.  They want drugs.  They want drugs delivered immediately...to their parents house (if that gives you any indication of the maturity of the incoming buyers). Did I say, now? Now, damnit.  No encryption, no protection....just a 1/4lb of week please...also can you make so the parents won't be suspicious of a box of weed showing up to their 16 years old child?

    There was a post yesterday in a thread helpfully titled 'what does stealth actually mean' that literally detailed the stealth techniques of different vendors, they also went on to name the vendors. Seriously this shit is getting out of control, how utterly stupid does a person need to be to think that is an ok thing to do on here and as you say it is getting worse as more naive and inept people stumble across SR. Maybe SR needs to operate a rules based system to follow for posting where anyone posting such info gets blocked/banned etc, it would be quite an onerous task to keep on top of it given the sheer number of these types of posts that are getting put up these days but it might make a dent in the problem and send a message, at the very least sticky a subject post at the top of each topic clearly stating what not to include in posts to try and educate people.
