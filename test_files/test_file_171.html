    I would like to know if a vacuum sealing machine could seal the "Heat Seal Foil Bags" or if I have to buy a special machine to seal the foil.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would like to make sure that the foil bags are flat when I seal them with whatever sealer I use, so it isn't loose and you can't really tell or feel whats inside the foil.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just want some feedback if heat seal foil works with a vacuum sealer or if I need to buy some other special type of machine, any feedback helps. Thanks.

    They are totally different, research mbb and mylar. Vac seal as the name suggests uses plastic which permeates, mylar for heat seal which are foil and obviously much less permeable. Over time odor will permeate any packaging which is why if you val seal it needs to be done multiple times to extend the time it takes for permeation. Vac sealing multiple times but keeping it very flat is an art form.

    so if i vac seal a couple times and then use some heat seal foil i should be good. im just trying to figure out techniques myself on how to make sure the actual package is completely flat and when its sealed it just feels like something hard and flat is inside, i think i got this ;)

    You know, I think if I was doing it, I'd
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a. Goodies in a baggie
    <br/>
    b. Vac seal in plastic 'dirty'
    <br/>
    c. Solvent wash
    <br/>
    d. Completely 'clean' mylar vac seal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So you'd need one sealer for vinyl, then another for the mylar. Never the two shall meet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Solvent wash inbetween.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then you'd be Captain impermeable.

    Unless you have a really expensive vac sealer it won't be strong enough for mylar bags but an iron should do the job ;) although in my shipping experience I stay away from Mylar in-case a pack is x-rayed because I believe it will block it or look weird on the X-ray just usually wrap up the first vac seal so goods aren't visible then vac seal it again and so on!

    - 'baggie' as in 'ziploc'
    <br/>
    - 'dirty' as in don't worry about keeping the outside of the ziploc clean.  Wear gloves for fingerprints, but don't stress if there's the potential for product being on the outside.
    <br/>
    - 'solvent wash meaning wash the ziploc in something that dissolves whatever product you're shipping.
    <br/>
    - I'd use mylar for international because it's impermeable - won't leach odors.  Everything shows up on xray - including ziploc bags inside vac seals bags.  ::)
