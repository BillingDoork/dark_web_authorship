    I have been reading a lot lately on xrays at customs (usa). Assuming a package is scanned, would having the contents inclosed in a radiopaque(xray proof) container be enough suspicion to constitute a search of said package? Or would they need further evidence like a dog? This is assuming it is also packaged in a mbb.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would the better route be just mbb with the product spread as thinly as possible? Or does that mbb showing up on the xray automatically constitute a search?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do they need to see to be able to open a package, anything at all? lol
    <br/>
    ^^^^assuming smell isn't a factor(mbb)

    Have you see xray pictures, like the ones they use at the airport? That should give you a good idea of what they are looking at. My guess due to the volume of packages going through the PO is that they use visual analysis programs to identify certain things. For instance guns are probably the easiest to identify. Things like powders, pills, gels, etc... theres no way for a computer to ID that they are of the illegal variety. MAYBE weed since it does have a distinct visual look. Its all about density not material type, so if you want to hide your shit you have to put something denser in there with it to break up the visual signature of it. Not just sort of denser (well this block of parmasean is denser than my weed) but alot denser, like metals, hard plastic, etc...

    Dealing with customs, I imagine it's not so straight forward.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Where is the package coming from, where is it going?Â  Who is shipping it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Who handled to customs declaration?... a freight forwarder?... private person?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -What's declared?... are you going to try labeling your buds as "computer equipment"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm of the opinion that it depends on factors like these... that and I'm sure they probably just open up packages randomly.

    The less dense a substance, the harder it is to visualize with xrays..

    Hiding in plain sight can be the best solution sometimes... I flew out of Nevada once (some of the toughest drug laws in the US) with a small vial of BHO that I pulled a label off some toiletry item, and stuck that in a plastic bag with my deodorant, razor, toothbrush, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My flight ended up getting cancelled/rerouted due to weather. I ended up in a different city than my original destination without my checked bag with the oil in it due to being able to get there faster by going to another airport and driving. Had to pick up my luggage at the airlines customer service desk/office, so that was a little nerve wracking, but it was all good in the hood.
