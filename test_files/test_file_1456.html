    Must be something about that last name "Springer"...

    DEA Charges Daniel Brian Springer, Daniel Brian Springer II, And Daniel Brian Springer III With Narcotics Conspiracy
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A 23-year-old Florida man, his father, and his grandfather--each of whom shares the same name--were charged today with felony narcotics conspiracy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Daniel Brian Springer III, Daniel Brian Springer II, 44, and Daniel Brian Springer, 63, were named in a federal complaint filed today in U.S. District Court in Tampa.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to an affidavit sworn by a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, the three generations of Springers conspired to obtain a two-pound, three-ounce package of Ecstasy that had ben mailed from China.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The drug shipment was intercepted by federal agents, who yesterday made a “controlled delivery” of the package to the home of Daniel Brian Springer. The eldest Springer subsequently told agents that he had agreed with his son to “take possession of the narcotics upon delivery.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then, in a move that will make Thanksgiving dinner really uncomfortable, Springer agreed to call his son while DEA agents monitored the call. The middle Springer announced that he was expecting a “package” to be delivered to his father’s residence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Later yesterday, Daniel Brian Springer II and Daniel Brian Springer III arrived at Daniel Brian Springer’s home, where they were confronted by DEA agents. The two younger Springers admitted that the narcotics delivery was “initiated” by Daniel Brian Springer III.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The youngest Springer told agents that he ordered the narcotics a few weeks ago via Black Market Reloaded, an online drug sales market that exists on the so-called dark web. Springer, who estimated that the drugs cost between $2000 and $2800, told agents that his “intent was to consume a portion of the MDMA, and to ‘make some money’ with the remainder.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While Springer the Younger knew that he ordered Ecstasy, Daniel Brian Springer II told agents that he thought the package contained bath salts, while Daniel Brian Springer (seen at left) said he thought the package held marijuana.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If convicted of the drug conspiracy charge, the respective Springers face a maximum of 20 years in prison.

     Someone probably snitched. They pack don't get intercepted coming in to the US, and if they do, just don't go pick it up. Having it delivered to your house is retarded.

    Why do you say the package didn't get intercepted?
    <br/>

    I've seen busts at people's homes and at the post office.

    Actually i am searching that kind of information, i am thinking to order 500 g to 1000 g  am-2201 or something in same category from china to middle east but i can not find any bulk delivery information in topics,
    <br/>
    if its neccesary i can rent a house with fake id than order the package to that house or something like that.
    <br/>
    Company or vendor says it has %100 reship guaranteed, and it says DCN packaging.
    <br/>
    i do not have problem about paying for details for reduce the risk but i dont have serious information about it.
    <br/>
    and even after i searched still i can not find useful information about bulk deliverys
    <br/>
    Maybe someone knows somethings about it ?
    <br/>
    i just want to be well preapared for worst scenario %100.
    <br/>
    thats the key point for me.

    I've never had to face the possibility of doing 20 years, so obviously I'm just speculating about my ability to bite my tongue. I will admit that it's possible that I might help myself out if it was an option that looked like the right decision.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can be damned sure that I'd do the whole 20 years before I'd send my son or my father up the river though.

    When customs catches a USPS package and plans a CD they are careful to ensure everything looks normal on the tracking.  If you have a package delivered to a clean home then you can claim you didn't order it.  If you go to pick it up then that might look a little more questionable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I read one case where the police officer stood behind the guy in line at the post office.  He signed and walked out to his care.  I think that's when they busted him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I haven't kept track of all of the controlled delivery cases I've read about so I don't have a reference.
