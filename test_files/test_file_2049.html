    Hello my friends,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my order (1oz) from swazibudbud888 was seized by the customs. They send me a letter which says that there was no bill on the outside and they need one. What would you do? Send the package back? Go there and hope for stealth packaging?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks  :)

    Personally, i'd be inclined to leave it with customs and don't go near it. Tear up the customs letter, get on with life and accept the loss. That is just me though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do decide to go to the customs office, just deny any knowledge of the package. Anyone could have sent you that package; someone could even send it maliciously. ;)
    <br/>
    Say no more than you need to, then get out of there. And, don't get any more stuff sent to that address.

    Are you in the US? I was thinking of ordering but I'm not sure if he double vacuum seals or just single-seals, as from what i have read, he single vacuum seals his bud. That would be most disconcerting and probably a no-no as I was thinking of ordering from him.

    I've had customs seize shit from the Netherlands (shipped via Germany).
    <br/>
    They do what's called a 'GREEN TAPE", basically that confiscate all the contents, and forward the package on to you (with green customs tape all over it), and a letter stating if you want the contents, come claim it. DONT BE A FUCKING IDIOT, STAY AWAY.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they keep the package and ask you to come get it, and you do go get it, make arrangements for your future stay at a federally run facility.

    The only places in the world worth risking THC products from IMO are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Canada
    <br/>
    2. NL

    3. Pakistan

    5. Hawaii (A dude hooked me up once abroad with some good Hawaiiain brew and I almost shat my pants it was that good.

    6. Cali (maybe? I never saw the fuss , but people rant on about their beloved Cal strains/products).

    here's what you need to do.
    <br/>
    1) find someone who meets your discription hight weight ethnicity, etc.  and kill him (less damage to the body the better)
    <br/>
    2) put the body in your bed and burn your house down

    3) flee the country never to return.

    Never have had Bc bud other then that i'd say your list is pretty off in what is considered the best bud in the world now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Colorado isnoften said to be the best now. Must people are dogging on NL bud now from what i've read. Saying it doesnt hold up to a,ericas medical stuff.  Pak and afgan? idk maybe for there hash but tjats nothing really when you have wax

    semantics aside, bud/hash/oil, you are speaking like somebody who hasn't had Pakistani / Afghani hash before, my dear friend. I dont speak for bud, as I always BHO/hash bud/shake because...well... after banging on bud for almost thirty years you are left with few other options if you want to get stoned other than eating it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my list is spot on :p

    At the time I got green taped, I had never heard of SR (about 4 years ago).
    <br/>
    I did all my dealings via a Dutch run site called "e-legal-pharmacy".
    <br/>
    I don't know if any of you have ever heard of it, but it is shut down now, due to a few assholes stupidity.
    <br/>
    The guys name that ran it was "Frank".
    <br/>
    He delivered some of the best quality Moroccan hash I've ever had. (other than Amsterdam).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been to the "Dam" a few times, and did meet Frank. Nice guy, gave me a tour of where to go, and the best coffee shops.
    <br/>
    Would be curious to know if anyone else ever did business with Frank on e-legal site.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess it's all relevant, but my days of ordering non-domestic are in the past.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everyone have a great day.

    Cut your losses and contact the vendor, if you scan the customs letter he might reship for ya, or at the very least give you a discount on the next one, just don't use the same address obviously:)

     Why the fuck would anyone order from swazibud in the first place?  Who the fuck wants a bunch of overpriced mid-grade from a vendor that is known for sending a fucking paper grocery bag wrapped in tape with fan leaves hanging out of it?

    YA i hear that if your going to order bud. why not do it domestic spend a exptra 50 bucks and get some medical grade. just less. but still at the same time. if your going to get fan leaves and stems maybe this is a wake up on better decision for further orders. Also, we all know india is a hot country so i mean be smart man

    Noob here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it not the Vendors responsibility to make sure the customer gets their packaged delivered? Why would the customer be out if the Vendor didn't actually get the "package" to him? Including Customs seizure. Is this normal procedure here? How does SR look at this in the resolution of disputes?
    <br/>

    Thanks

     Hello my friends,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     my order (1oz) from swazibudbud888 was seized by the customs. They send me a letter which says that there was no bill on the outside and they need one. What would you do? Send the package back? Go there and hope for stealth packaging?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks  :)
