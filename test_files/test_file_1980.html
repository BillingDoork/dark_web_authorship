    Hi, I have been using SR a few months. My main address I use is a multi occupant house where I used to live and I own a flat; I regularly get mail there so it's ideal.
    <br/>
    I have collected 5 deliveries from there no problem. The sixth didn't show up. (it was a small valium order) At the time I thought probably the vendor had selective scammed me; as three people who FE'd on same day as me also complained they never received. (That was last time I FE'd, it's hard to avoid when you start out though)
    <br/>
    Next order, my ma and stepdad were on holiday so I could use their house safely. Again no problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This recent time I had to use original address. I had used mums as precaution, but really convinced myself the missing Valium was most likely due to vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I meant to try a small order of blues to test, but when vendor was delayed I thought fuck it and ordered couple grammes of class A's.
    <br/>
    I'm in UK so it should have come next day. It's been long enough now that I'm fairly sure it's not coming... The Royal Mail is fairly reliable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I very much doubt the vendor has scammed me this time. I have deakt successfully weith him since I started and I have sent him money out of escrow in the past (a similar sum) so I feel like if he was going to scam me he'd have done it then!
    <br/>
    So, I'm not sure what to think.....has the address been flagged. I have another small order processing, and I'm not sure whether to get it sent to same address. I don't really have an alternative. I could try my mums but it seems dodgy with them there. I do still get mail there too but I don't know, I can just see her asking what it is. She gets worried if I use her broadband for torrents!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's tempting to send it to original address to test for sure if address is burned. But if it doesn't turn up I will be a) pissed off not to get drugs
    <br/>
    b) increasingly paranoid!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not that worried as far as LE goes, but stuff not arriving does make you feel uneasy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically I'm just looking for perspective on whether I should try the address again or write it off and find somewhere new (which isn't so easy). I can't use my own because the wife will cut balls off.

    i have 6 orders comming, they were all orderd last week or the week before and range from H to Weed, I have recived 1 of them loll, i think its the royal mail have fucked it right up. To the point i may have lost a good Â£200 lolo. not happy im not. Im hoping that just waiting will do the trick.
    <br/>
    Best bit is 2 are recorded !!! they havent turned up, 10 days and waiting.
