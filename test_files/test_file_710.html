    "So I ordered a 10g+ package with MDMA from Silk Road that never arrived. I had ordered multiple packages from SR before, all of whom had arrived with no issues. I live in Scandinavia and ordered international as always. Usually a package would take about one week to arrive from this particular vendor so when it approached two weeks I started getting worried about the package being lost or intercepted. Luckily, I had done my homework thoroughly and was pretty confident that I was not in any legal trouble even in worst case scenario.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One month went without any news regarding the package. Then two months. I figured I had just lost the money and was a bit sad about this fact. This was by far my biggest order and I thought of it as an investment that would last for a LONG time onwards. (I had none intention of selling it, me and my friends just wanted to have a steady supply for the foreseeable future. I'm not sure if I'd be able to convince a jury the same thing though..)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is not to say I wasn't paranoid. Indeed, I very much was. I did not talk about drugs on the phone ever. I never have, but now I made sure all my friends was painfully aware of this. I'd always played it safe on SR, not keeping any incriminated information on my computer or at my residence. Obviously, I didn't make any new orders either. It is hard to describe how much this fact helped me later on. Even though I only talked to the police - they never searched my computer or my residence, and probably didn't listen in on my phone calls either - knowing this gave me the necessary peace of mind to confidently deny any knowledge of the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    About the two month mark I received a note by mail from the police, telling me that I was being summoned to come in for questioning in regards to a criminal investigation. No specific information. I was pretty sure it had to do about my missing package, but given how long they must had kept the package without contacting me and that the summoning was so vague that it could be about literally anything made me a bit uncertain nevertheless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Turns out, it was about the package. They presented me with a photo of the intercepted package and told me it was drugs and that I would have to explain it to them. I told them I didn't know anything about it. I did not try to act surprised or anything, I told myself I couldn't beat them at this game, I just had to deny it and be confident that they had no real evidence. I really wasn't. Mentally, I had gone through everything I've ever done on SR and figured I was pretty safe, but I couldn't be absolutely sure. It was very nerve wrecking to say the least.
    <br/>
    The police officer questioning me probably saw this. I tried to avoid eye contact and just looking down to the floor telling him I didn't know anything about it. He pressed me on it, told me which address it was sent from and if I knew the location or if I've been there recently. He asked if I used to order stuff online and what that would be and if I shared the mailbox with anyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There weren't to many questions. He told me that if I admitted to the crime early on, it would really make things easier later. When I made a statement denying knowledge about the package, he would write it down and exaggerate the statement tremendously and asked if this was correct (I had to say yes). I knew that if I was later to be found guilty, the police had really cornered me in this interview and in a way forced me to lie as much as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They did also want information about my bank account. I granted them access (they asked for a specific time frame) and thought to myself that if they had some sort of vague evidence, my cooperation could be argued to show that I had nothing to hide. I did this because my bank account had none incriminating information and could only strengthen my defense. If they had any real evidence, they might just test my cooperation and get access nevertheless. Looking back I don't know if this was the right call, but luckily for me it turned out okay. I was let ago after maybe 15-20 minutes."

    Quick hint.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If police has enough evidence to bust you, they will bust you, not invite you to have a chat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Questioning" is not a subpoena of any sort. You go, you get someone to acknowledge your presence, explain that you don't want to answer any questions and leave.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police excel at getting people to incriminate yourself, even with what seems totally innocent questions. Redditor went from "Oh, I can handle talking about my travels" to giving them access to his bank account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't talk to police. Never. Not about anything. Don't think you are smarter than them.

    Why do you answer the police?
    <br/>
    You know a second question will come after you have answered the first question.
    <br/>
    And so on and on and on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep your mouth shut and tell them you are right in the middle of a good book.
    <br/>
    So it will be a week or two before you have time for them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they have a warrant they will take you down the station, if they don't they will ask you to come (in a demanding manner)
    <br/>
    Didn't your mom teach you not to talk to strangers?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or are all of those police-officers belong to your best friends?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything you say can and WILL be used in a court of law.
    <br/>
    Don't you watch television?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They try to nail you down and you keep talking?
    <br/>
    What did the police ever do for you?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I don't like you I don't talk to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Simple.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if they want to know something so bad they can call my counselor ,
    <br/>
    who has never time and has his office is at least 200 miles away,
    <br/>
    where the police is welcome to ask the question they want.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All pro deo for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The last time the police came at my door I had to come with them to the police-station.
    <br/>
    I told them to want to see a warrant for my arrest, because that would be the only way I was going to the police-station.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They threatened me and advised me to come , because I had to come anyway.
    <br/>
    It could be done the nice way to come along, or the hard way when they hed their papers within a hour of 2.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My words were"" Are you done, because I have far more important things to do, I was just reading the newspapers"".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The officer wanted to hit me, pulled even up his sleeves but held his vist, and promised to be back with a warrant.
    <br/>
    That he wasn't going to be nice because I made him angry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When he went for his car he said ""last chance, for the last time I ask you nicely... ... ... so you chose the hard way!""
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My answer before I closed my door was ""good luck with your warrant"".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never saw him again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Barking dogs don't bite!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...and dogs they are !!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will be your counselor and i forbid you to talk to them. When you do get arrested you wait just as long you have spoken to your new appointed counslor. Because you forgot my name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the police asks at your door who that counselor may be, you just repeat to have your instructions not to talk to them.
    <br/>
    If they want to know your name etc, you show them your driverlisense or identification card or passport, but you do not speak!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you're in a car and am asked where you are going to or where you came from, don't try to be nice.
    <br/>
    Be a jerk without words. Claim to have a medical condition which you prevent to speak. Doctors orders!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or that policeman has to be your best friend, that makes things different.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Write a reminder above your door;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ""Oh lord, help me to keep my big mouth shut!
    <br/>
    until I know what i am saying !""
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You don't have to talk to the police!
    <br/>
    That will do your counselor for you.
    <br/>
    Unless you are a snitch..., they do talk to the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's so easy...and it pays!
    <br/>
    When me and my friends did some crime, all of them went to jail, because they couldn't keep their mouth shut.
    <br/>
    I was free, no judge convicted me.
    <br/>
    Only 4 days of silence at the station prevents you from going to jail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now the police knows who I am and they do not even bother anymore to speak to me.
    <br/>
    I never come to them, so I don't need them.
    <br/>
    If they come to me, they need me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THEY OFFERING ME EVEN MONEY now to talk to them.
    <br/>
    But I am not in speaking terms with them, period!
    <br/>
    My mother doesn't allow it.
    <br/>
    And I have far more important things to do, the talk to the police,  like reading a book of some kind

    I don't know about the laws in scandanavia but a U.S. citizen should never talk to cop without an attorney period. There is nothing you can say that will ever help you, you can only contribute to your own conviction. please watch this video so you understand from a top attorney why you should never speak to the police.

    Exactly the same applies in scandinavia, never talk to the cops without your attorney present! The only thing you are obligated to tell, is your name, date of birth, address and work place/position.

    Never admit anything, if they have the evidence then they arrest you. If not, they can't do much, they'll make you try and admit to something, you deny it and they'll give up.

    Yes, in the USA one can deny ordering anything. Play dumb, but be polite. Only once did I get a package from Amsterdam intercepted at the US Customs office (it was for 7g of weed). All I got was a smashed package (with no weed, dammit!) and a form letter with 2 parts: the top all had something to the effect "your package contained contraband under a certain amount, and was confiscated". The second part of the letter, which did not apply to me had words to the effect "You have ordered contraband over such-and such amount, and an agent will be by in a few days (presumably to ask me about it". It was, by their own words, not a big deal. Nothing came of it, but this vendor had a full refund policy if we sent him a copy of the green US Customs tape &amp; a letter from them. I got my weed a couple of weeks later. It apparently was a random search.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Deny everything, but politely. You will hopefully be OK.

    Ah the good old "if you come clean it will go better for you" tactic, you have to love how they sell their lies to trap you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You did the right thing, you gave them nothing and they had nothing, hence you get to walk away a lot wiser and hopefully more careful in future.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have heard the Scandinavian countries do this, i.e. make you come in and if you don't then issue a warrant so I get you had no choice, you should however have had your legal representation present with you though irrespective of whether you felt that may look more incriminating.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Glad you kept your wits about you and handled the situation well, pleasing to read someone actually takes the time to educate themselves on how to avoid nasty consequences.

    I read that MMIM only ships a max of 7g powder per letter , however other vendors ship upto 10g per letter.

    Would it be any more risky to have 7-20g in a letter?

      I don't know about the laws in scandanavia but a U.S. citizen should never talk to cop without an attorney period. There is nothing you can say that will ever help you, you can only contribute to your own conviction. please watch this video so you understand from a top attorney why you should never speak to the police.

     Exactly the same applies in scandinavia, never talk to the cops without your attorney present! The only thing you are obligated to tell, is your name, date of birth, address and work place/position.

     Theres a saying that goes; "You can not talk your way out of an arrest but you can easily talk yourself into one".

    The "kick down down the door if they need me" quote was a good one. I will remember that in the future.

    SWIM would like to congratulate you. You understood, if your EVER questioned, it IS because they LACK EVIDENCE!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could also ask them to visit you at your home, that you do not want to waste your time on some bullshit package you didn't order.  ;) take them out of their element. invite them in and offer them some soda and tell them your pissed off but that you understand that it's not their fault and that they are just doing their job.  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LE are sneaky, trying to be friendly. Just remember, they are doing their job, they don't give a shit about you as a person. They are almost working in auto-pilot and just following protocal like a well trained parrot. To them, if you admit, they feel momentarily happy and move on to the next case. Don't give them that satisfaction.

    When I was young the stupid local cops arrested me and my mates for some car break-ins. We were all high as fuck when they took us down. The seperated us and questioned us. They knew the flat across from me had been broken into and also asked me about that. I told them that I would tell then who did it if they would let me and my mates go. They agreed and I gave them a story about a kid I knew who was a troublemaker telling them he had bragged to me about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Satisfied the dullards let us go. The kid was the son of the police chief. The morons didn't even know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That story is an exception and you need to believe that today cops are better trained at interrogation. As my sig says, never incriminate yourself.

    Exactly! Even if you are 100% innocent and never did any crime of any sort, they could still pull the old get a warrant because they "smelled weed"  trick!

    That is technically not possible if they were not near your home.

    I understand the urge to tell the community about seizures and LE, but if anything, that's additional evidence against the suspect. Lots of info in that post: location, substance, time frame between ordering and questioning, suspect's attitude when being questioned, suspect's answers...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People, tell us about seizures and LE, but don't go into as many details as this post, it's against your own interests.

    Since everyone is saying don't talk to LE, I'll be the devil's advocate here. Notice at the end of the OP story, he was actually let go after talking to the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes if you convince the police that it really isn't worth their time to pursue you, then you might actually benefit from talking to the police. This person gave the police information that looked like he wasn't involved, the bank account info. The police looked at the info and probably decided that he probably was innocent, or they looked at the evidence and decided they couldn't easily bring charges on the OP with the additional information he provided during the interview.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So sometimes it does pay to talk if you can convince the police of your innocence, then it will prevent LE from pursuing the case further and possibly digging up more evidence on you by talking to your "friends" whom you were buying for.
