    i think it's preference mainly. but shipping internationally has a lot more risks than staying within your own country. plus there's less chance of unhappy customers who's packages get seized in customs, no matter how stealthy you ship something there will always be a few that get discovered. also with something getting discovered in customs there will be at least some attempt by law enforcement to trace it back to the sender, though if the correct steps are taken then the investigation won't get anywhere, but better safe than sorry i suppose.

    Basically what PG said. It increases the amount of work, the cost of shipping, and the risks for everyone involved.

    The US has plenty of people so there is no real need for a larger customer base. The cost is higher and the risk is way higher. Even for a pretty big fee I would not do it because I like using a system with almost no risk and that is pretty easy and safe for both buyer and seller. Plus a big part of shipping is totally blending in and reducing any meaningful way of detection.

    Totally agree, I also just don't like the uncertainty of weather my order is going to get here or not, at least with domestic orders you will know within a few days but I just waited ages to get a load of jwh-203 and the suspense was killing me (and i think that shit is still legal!)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But fear not because laws of supply and demand say that where there is demand someone is going to supply :)
    <br/>
    It will just take a little time to realize there is much money to be made, I'm already talking to a few friends to get on here and start vending I'm sure others are too.

    At what price are you willing to ship prescription drugs such as dexedrine or adderall to uk?
    <br/>
    I would agree to take all risks on me + any sensible markup price for the trouble?

    would you be intereted in +30-40% markup?

    Too much of a hassle getting things through customs. It means you would have to lie on a customs form which is a crime as well as sending whatever substance which may possibly be illegal..

    Shipping something larger than a letter or even a letter with tracking of any sort to a destination outside of the USA from within the USA requires the sender to go into a post office during their ridiculous business hours, stand in line for about 10 to 30 minutes, get their face and appearance all over MANY CCTV cameras and get their fingerprints all over a package with illegal drugs inside of it while committing "mail fraud" (false return address) and filling out a false customs declaration.
    <br/>

    Nobody with a brain wants to do that. Prison is not fun, and the US pigs will throw us in there for any one of those things, let alone all of those reasons.

    you also have to remember a higher chance of package getting seized along with escrow makes it a much bigger risk for a seller. you could approach a repuptable seller and offer to go around escrow if he is unwilling to send to your neck of the woods. taking the risk on yourself for loss of funds may encourage him to sell to you. but with escrow and you being able to just put a claim in to get your fund back if customs seizes package i can see why a seller would not want to send international.

    Just adds to the list of LE who would be interested in us.  As others have pointed out, seriously increases danger to buyer and seller.  If seller doesn't post what country he's sending from, I'm not interested.  We've enough weak points, why add to'em?

    Shipping internationally is risky, dangerous, increases likelihood of seizure and increased suspicion triple-fold. It's a bad idea for both seller and buyer. Just my two cents.

    For what its worth, I thought I would throw out some positive personal experience on the this topic, although I generally agree with the majority of the posters that the extra risk shipping outside the US is probably not worth it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Five-six years ago, my significant other spent almost two years working in a Middle Eastern country as a civilian contractor for a private company which, although privately owned, provided its services under the direction of the US military.  So even though my SO was technically civilian, most military regulations applied.  Transportation, housing, meals, medical...were all provided by the military.  All mail was sent to the APO address of the base there, but packages had to go through customs just like all international packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sure most of you are aware, but for those that aren't, most any drug is huge no-no in the Mid East, even simple possession can warrant a death sentence in some cases.  Alcohol is also banned, I believe in pretty much all of the Mid East, with the exception of one small country (which is not where SO was), I assume for religious reasons, but since most of the laws there are derived directly from Islamic law, the government strictly enforces the alcohol ban.  Since the US military generally abides by the law of the country in which its base is located, the drug and alcohol ban applied to all military and civilian personnel under its command.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well SO has never been much of a druggie, but loves the booze and a pharmaceutical or two.  So, being the wonderful partner that I am, I devised a way to ship plenty of goodies off, enough in fact, that SO covered most of my expenses by selling any excesses to comrades!  I didn't, however, have any experience in stealth shipping methods. I won't go into specifics here for obvious reasons, but I just used some common sense, a few supplies I already had around the house, and those shoe box size flat rate boxes the post office used to carry.  I sent at least one package every week SO was there, and sometimes sent as many as three per week.  Only about one package per month contained pills, but every single one contained tequila!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And every single package made it to SO with no complications whatsoever, except for one.  This was probably the second or third to last package I sent, since the company's contract was almost up, but somehow the contents of the package leaked out, and of course besides the visual give-away, I'm sure the tequila smell was very noticeable!  Since SO was under the direction of the US Military, the military's protections also applied, so the package was simply disposed of with no other ramifications, which is not a luxury most oversees shipments from SR would enjoy, obviously.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, while I understand why anyone would consider overseas shipment too risky, I just wanted to say that it can be done successfully.  I would do it again, under the same circumstances.  The only regret is that we never determined why that one package leaked - whether I failed to properly seal everything, or if the package was damaged somehow during shipment.  Its one of things I'll always wonder about, I guess!

    And now for something completely different...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not wanting to rant and villify a whole country, but _most_ European countries are not bass ackwass, paranoid, batshit insane when it comes to mail at least not when it's from a country not associated with major drug trafficking like the USA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I first read about the paranoia (and afterwards the 'evidence' by janetreno) the only thing that came to my mind was (to quote Pam from Archer): "Holy Shitsnacks!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why most drug laws may not be as liberal as those of the Netherlands most countries still don't view every package coming from abroad with the scrutiny of an entomologist discovering an ant pile in the rainforest. Let alone resort to tactics like controlled delivery which has a faint undertone of "To catch a Predator" minus the direct entrapment. I've watched quite a fair share of documentaries on German customs and it was always South American countries or likewise that aroused their suspicion. I know too many people that recieved mail with contraband out of the US that were really sloppy packaged compared to SR standards (I'm not saying that kind of sloppyness is good).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The mentality underlying this kind of laissez fair attitude is that there is little reason to believe why somebody would send drugs to Europe from the US as almost everything is as available and probably cheaper in the domestic market.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not saying go ahead and flood the market in the most asinine way possible and please by all means do your research on the specific country you're sending to (I'm giving SR users the benefit of the doubt that they know that Europe isn't one homogenous blob), but the "OMG WAY TOO FCUKING DANGEROUS" mentality is uneducated FUD to me that I just can't leave standing there uncommented.

    First, a BIG +1 for making the first "if they hadn't passed the debt ceiling increase" joke I've heard.  And a pretty good one at that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would you be so kind as to go one step further (if you can) and list in two columns what you would consider to be the EU countries where the postal inspections made it an "acceptable" risk and another listing the "unacceptable"?  thanks!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If other EU buyers (or sellers) weighed in on this thread we might be able to come to some sort of (almost a) consensus fairly quickly.  :)

    Sorry but I'm going to have to disagree again. Using my personal experience from about 20 years ago, I was coming back from Europe and was wearing a jacket that I had been to a party in. At that party there had been a few blokes smoking weed. Four months later, I was leaving the country and the international customs dog sniffed me. I was strip searched, and detained for 7 hours (and didn't have a thing on me.) Again, I ask you, if they had this kind of level of security well before 9-11 and today's modernization of drug detection, I'm sure detecting international drug smuggling (especially as how they prioritize it with 'would-be-terrorism' is far more advanced than anyone knows.
