    !!Cross Contamination!!
    <br/>
    Change clothes rooms and wash hands btw seals wipe sealer.
    <br/>
    As tight as product allows without damage to quality or appearance.
    <br/>
    Two seals on each end of unit,cut on second seals.
    <br/>
    Wash unit light soap dish,detergent not bleach alcohol.
    <br/>
    Let dry.
    <br/>
    Repeat all steps in clean environment including self do nut contaminate unit.
    <br/>
    Personally would use 5 to 6 tight seals dryer sheet in btw absorb smell.
    <br/>
    Xray machines Ive seen use colors to separate items light orange light plastic dark orange hard plastic green organics blue metal.
    <br/>
    Don't buy your shipping supplies after you handle or consume any substance.
    <br/>
    Keep package even weight distribution and tight does not hurt to do box in box with bubble etc in btw shipping companies recommend it and2-3in will keep a box cutter or pocket knife     breaking/or puncturing unit.
    <br/>
    Tape box neatly.
    <br/>
    Take a shower with box in bathroom away from water use extra shampoo and hot water.
    <br/>
    Take your perfectly regular innocent box to a 3rd party a company that offers shipping through the major companies where you can walk in to use there computer to print out whatever send and return addy you want but under they're label.
    <br/>
    Ship ground or 3 day 5 day do not recommend overnight early am.Will also not raise suspicion with high cash shipping.
    <br/>
    Do not recommend signature.
    <br/>
    The carrier will pick up from store with all they're other packages before last deadline and unit will immediately be moving.
    <br/>
    Try to avoid weekends where possible.
    <br/>
    Do not walk in high smelling like substances or looking suspicious neat and clean will go along away.
    <br/>
