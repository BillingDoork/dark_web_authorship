    I ordered my first product from sr last night. Everything went through today the order is still "processing" will the button to finalize it appear after the vendor has confirmed my order?
    <br/>
    Also if anyone could help me out on how to get my pgp key onto my page so I can be contacted.

    Yes, most vendors "confirm" only once they've shipped the product, so don't worry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you mean by "get my pgp key into my page" Do you not know how to find your public key is that the trouble your having?

    What I did with my first order was I used PGP with the vendor's public key to encrypt my address and delivery instructions and pasted that directly into the address field in the shopping cart. Then, right below that, I pasted my public key so they could reply to me discreetly if they had any news for me (they never replied; just shipped)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This worked the first time, but the second time, the vendor said they couldn't read my encrypted message that was pasted in the "address" field of the shopping cart. I wonder if I exceeded the max number of characters for that field by putting in the encrypted PGP message AND my public key...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what I am doing from now on is just messaging the vendor with my public key so they'll have it if they need to contact me for whatever reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone knows a better way or can point out something wrong I'm doing here, your feedback would be appreciated.
