    Has it ever occured that a USPS package has been marked as "delivered" and wasn't?  I recently placed an order with a vendor, then messaged him a day after his estimated arrival.  He asked for my city and after receiving it sent me some text saying (general terms) USPS facility--&gt;city--&gt; delivered at (time) on (date) in (city)... My place has had no packages whatsoever arrive.  I was also awake and on the main floor of the hosue when the supposed delivery time was.  Could it be a USPS fuck-up with tracking?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I ask for the actual tracking number or just send it to resolution for them to look up the tracking?  I should also mention that this is my 2nd order in a row gone wrong with top 10% vendors, but at 2 different addresses that are more than a long drive apart.  I also haven't ordered anything "important" to this address in about 3 months, or ordered anything at all other than a 10 strip (which didn't come to another address) for about 1 month.  Lastly, there is also some reviews on the vendor page saying that packages arrived a day before their package was marked as delivered... Any suggestions on how to approach this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets say, for some filtrage, that I am completely certain that no package has came.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    When hasn't USPS fucked up tracking?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But really, you should have a real tracking # given to you, not just by word of mouth by the vendor.  Rarely does a package get marked as delivered and it is not there, in cases like that it is most likely stolen.  In cases like that where you are only told by word of mouth by the vendor that it was delivered, he/she is likely to be fibbing until he/she gives up the real tracking #
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck to you.

    Thanks m8. I'll have to tread lightly as vendors seem to take offense to these types of inquiries, although, he seems like a really respectable guy and has a flawless record.  I'll send a message inquiring, but hopefully its just a mix-up  :(

    it could be at the wrong address or a lazy postman scans all packages at post office to save time, just being marked delivered doesnt mean its at the right house. there is an option in tracking to get a more detailed version that tells each time it was scanned.

    Got the legit tracking number pretty quickly (Thanks WeedNation) and everything is in line saying that it was delivered.  Nobody but myself knew about the delivery, and my neighbors are basically all very old couples, so i'm looking more towards the USPS messing up side. I've been reading up on this happening sporatically, and it seems an impossible to win situation unless someone in the system admits their fault or if someone takes notice to the error and corrects it (that's a hoot).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have finalized and kissed my money goodbye :/  Hopefully, a neighbor turns up with it.  Would it be worth it to contact my local PO or USPS customer service to check everything (including my route mailman)?  I know that the contents of the package is risky,  but for all anyone knows I am just another victim of the incopetence and lack of motivation of the postal system.

    Yes, USPS pulls the clutch for the trifect of orders gone wrong for me... On the flip side, I went and read a couple pages full of shipping nightmares that somehow worked out--&gt; I feel about 5% more confident :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will probably try contacting the PO or customer service, but from what I've seen they can't do much other become mad at you for disturbing them with something..."unusual"...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why doesn't SR ship with other services?
    <br/>
    I'll update if anything goes right for me ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck to the rest of you

    Had a package get sent form the Northeast to Indiana. Checked the next day after sending and it was scanned in Miami. The next day it arrived at the destination. And yes, USPS marks their shit delivered all the time when it is not delivered.

    if it is hidden well enough that there is no value you might get lucky and the person the got it looks inside and doesnt want it and returns it, or ask the postman if he remembers it. i have found misdelivered packages that way but im in a small town

    Hey Croskin,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wanted to chime in and let you know that often times when packages are seized the USPS will mark their tracking as being "delivered." This will almost always appear on the tracking page as jumping straight from the "processed through sorting center" closest to your packages destination. If the tracking says "sorting complete" and "out for delivery" then chances are it did not get seized and something must have happened (stolen, lost, etc). Do not lose all hope though, on a few occasions packages have been marked as "delivered" only to be re routed to the correct destination later. Keep an eye on the tracking page and look for changes, often these will give you clues. Hope this helps.

    there is an option on tracking for more details that gives better details. i have used that on ebay packages that were lost look os the page that says delivered theres a place. it takes some time for the details to collect but it should give a time,
