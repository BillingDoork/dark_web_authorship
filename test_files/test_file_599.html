    Okay, so I'm starting to deal in my local area and I'm going to start ordering in bulk to supply my mdma hungry locals. What amount of mdma is too much to order through the mail whether it be in crystals or in capsules? Just a noob trying to be a safe as possible.

    It depends on how much you are talking about..
    <br/>
    We send Oz's within the UK as a standard order. More can be moved domestically very easily, KG's would even be fine.
    <br/>
    But for a standard though the letter box job, a few Ozs a time probably

    The largest I am currently willing to order if I order internationally is 250g.  If I purchase domestic I would probably be willing to go over 250g as long as price was on point and it was a reputable vendor.

    Just remember that there's always a risk that you take. Many people get 100+ g's just fine. But there's always going to be a seizure here and there. Order from a reputable vendor and domestic if you can.

    The OP can't post here anymore.  Hopefully he's still watching the thread though..  It really depends on where you are, what your goals are, and what kind of capital you have to start with.

    +1.  It seems like customs seizure's biggest hit to a buyer is the actual value of the package, not the chance of a controlled delivery (which appears to be very rare for people in the US).  Still, I had DHL tell me their customs department had one of my packages in their possession and I decided not to even give them a call.  I hope they have fun with the package because I ain't about to give anyone any evidence to bust me with.  It was a decently large order but I can't put a price on my freedom!

    I strongly suggest you do your own research and do not rely on the replies on this thread. The threshold for importation charges is VERY low compared to other circumstances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't be complacent, do your homework and have safe drop arrangements for any and all o/s shipments.

    All depends on your drop. I wouldn't order more than personal amounts to my own address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have a solid reliable drop with no way to track it back to you, then I think the answer changes to "however much you can afford to lose".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you keep going bigger at some point its going to be worth LE's time to stake out the drop, no idea how much it would take so I don't want to speculate.

    In the past, a VERY reputable vendor assured me that 1/2 oz's of MDMA or MDA wouldn't be worth LE's time or effort, but that she wouldn't send more than that in a single pack for that reason.

    My parcel was supposed to be dropped off at my address.  I live in an apartment complex where all the mailboxes are relatively small and all in the same place.  I have hard the PO boxes get scrutinized more and, honestly, something about picking stuff up from the actual Post Office sketches me out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my opinion.
