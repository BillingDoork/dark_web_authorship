    Hello. So I have had many orders delivered perfect without any problems. Recently tried anotherÂ  trusted vendor and vendor claims the express shipping signature had been waived (so i wouldn't have to sign anything) But when the product was supposed to be here, there was nothing that showed up. I asked the vendor for the status, they said that delivery was attempted but no one answered and that the mailman requested a signature (on an express delivery in which the vendor said I SHOULD NOT have to sign) but no one answered so they left a note. That is what the vendor said the status said. Now there are a few issues. 1, There was NO notice left at door or mailbox or anywhere, which was claimed to have left. 2, requested signature on order the vendor says the signature is waived so i shouldnt have to sign. The vendor said the mailmen sometime slack and ask for a signature not reading the signature waived notice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Soooooo. If it was attempted and claimed that a notice was left, how come there was NO notice!! and if I'm not supposed to sign, why did they request someone to answer and sign!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor said i can just take the notice to the post office and pick it up there. But there is NO notice to do that. So will the post office attempt another deliver again tomorrow? or will it just remain at the post office? and since i don't have a notice, how would i go to pick it up if i don't have a notice anyway (thats if i decide its safe to do so).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this an attempt at a controlled delivery? this is a domestic order in the USA. If this was a CD would they care if someone answered and signed, or would they just deliver it and then break down the door in a short time (enough time that they expect i opened the package)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HELP!! What should I do? Should i call the post office and say i was told something was attempted to be delivered, and ask if they have my package? Should I wait for the post man all day tomorrow and then sign for the package or should i decline the package and say I don't know what it is. OR assuming my house is completely clean of any illegal stuff, should i sign for the package then not open it for a couple days and mark it return to sender? or would it not even matter if i opened it if I signed for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If i sign for it at the post office and it IS a CD, would they arrest/interogate me there? or would they wait until I made it home then break down the door?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HELP!!!

    They'll attempt another delivery if you don't come by the post office to pick up the package. At that time, you'll be able to see whether or not the signature is waived and if it is you can just point that out to the postman. And if it isn't waived, you have rights to a partial-to-full refund on the grounds that the vendor was supposed to waive it and claimed he did, thus it was either compromised(Thus, vendors fault for packaging that couldn't make it past inspection) or the vendor lied/fucked up/something, in which case it is still the vendor's fault for not waiving it.

    I find it very suspicious that the vendor is claiming a note has been left when specifically stating no signature is required, and that you could not find a note to begin with. I wouldn't be too concerned about a CD unless it was for a large amount of contraband. Personally, if I had to sign for a package after being notified I don't have to, alarm bells would start to ring. Notes asking to collect at post offices for letter sized packages have danger written all over them, parcels on the other hand are different.

    It sounds like you don't have the tracking information and you're being bullshitted. Get the tracking details if they exist.

    I order ordinary stuff online all the time and I have had the ole "delivery attempted, note left" on tracking more than a couple times. And I believe either the mailman didn't want to get out and put a note on the door, or they forgot about the package when filling the mailbox so they just claim they notified me. Could be the case, maybe not so, but just thought I'd explain my experiences with a similar situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The whole sig thing, though, has never been an issue, since I never minded signing for shit off ebay, etc. Hope all turns out well.

    Hello all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for your advice and input. It turns out to be what some of you said. The LAZY mailman routine. It was delivered the very next day without any problems. So they must have not had the package didn't feel like carrying it or something and since I have a drive way probably didn't want to go all the way to the house to leave a notice!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you for all your input!
