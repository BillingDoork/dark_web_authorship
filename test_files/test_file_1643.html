    Heyho,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've seen on SR a master key who should work for most post boxes in apartment houses.
    <br/>
    What do you think about searching an empty apartment with a post box and getting risky deliveries to this address?
    <br/>
    A disadvantage would be that you can't provide a real name, but usually packages arrive to addresses even without matching names.
    <br/>
    I mean for example if I get a lb mexican mid-grade from PlanetExpress for 420€ I can turn this where I live into 4500€..
    <br/>
    If it works and arrives at the point of destination I could grab my package without any danger.
    <br/>
    So I would have the chance to get 10x the money I paid and the only risk would be the loss of the 420€ if customs find it.
    <br/>
    What do you think?
    <br/>
    Does anyone know which vendor sold those key or where I can get it?
    <br/>
    Do you think such keys are even legit and work? Share your experience please :)
    <br/>

    I have no idea about the question at hand but i wouldn't order from planet express for a while, think he's turned scammer.
    <br/>
    Will be watching this thread though as I really need a safe drop spot, Could you please post a link to this key as well.

    A single master key that works for "most post boxes in apartment houses"?  No way is that legit.
