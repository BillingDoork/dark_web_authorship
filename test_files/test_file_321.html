    I ordered a decent amount of a drug from a vendor who ships the same item from country A and country B. The listing I ordered was from country A, where the price per gram is a bit more expensive than if I had ordered from country B. However, I ordered from country A because I've had bad experiences with country B's customs, and because the package requires a signature from country B. Now, the vendor did not send from country A like he was supposed to, and instead he mailed me the package from country B. He has agreed to refund me the difference in price since he shipped from the wrong country, but now it seems as if the package has been stopped by country B's customs authorities &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I be refunded or reshipped 100% since the vendor did not send from the country that the listing states it was to be sent from?

    Seems to me like he fucked up big time on his end. 100% of either of those, that's something you two could agree on.

    How do you know customs took it? Did you get a letter? Are you sure it's not just a delay in customs?

    It's not for sure seized just yet, but it's been sitting in customs across seas long enough for me to believe it's been taken. We shall see however...
