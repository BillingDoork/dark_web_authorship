    It could work if the hotel room was registered in the same fake name as the package!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you might also have to produce id for the front desk to release your package to you.

    Well when you go in to get a hotel room. they ask for ID and either a credit card or cash upfront.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So theres no real way to even get a hotel room without an ID.
    <br/>
    after the Hotel room is registered in the fake name. id say it could work

    maybe you can.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    try the following:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    call a four star hotel
    <br/>
    tell them you stayed with your wife (this part is important) them last year and loved it
    <br/>
    you would like to go there again next week, but because of .... you can just stay in the city for a day.
    <br/>
    you will check out their restaurant for sure and want to ask them a favor (receiving the letter, because...)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you are very specific about when the letter comes, how your name is spelled, etc. they may not ask for an ID. better you have an fake ID or some paper that identifies you as john doe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck.

    We don't ship to hotels as we felt we were scammed last year - buyer said he did not sign so he didn't receive (who knows it was Vegas's MGM)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm just providing a seller side. I feel confident a seller will accept your btc's though

    No, i highly doubt that would work if your not a guest in the hotel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It possibly could work if you'v stayed there in the past (being as your name would still be on file) but seems like a big risk to me

    By reading this thread and your other, you just need to throw in the towel.  Seriously if you can't figure out on your own how to acquired a package without referencing tips from a book thats 20 years old, you don't need to be doing whatever you are planning you to do after you get your package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is assuming that you somehow actually get your package because from what I have read so far, you're going to fuck it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hang it up for now. Do your homework. Don't jump into something you obviously aren't schooled in enough yet.
