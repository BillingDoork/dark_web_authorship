    OP received the letter so if it was customs they would've found the drugs from NL right? And why wouldn't customs just open the letter like you're supposed to and then tape it back?

    maybe they are trying to crack down and hit as many letters as they can and hole punch them now? and the spot they hole punched didnt have the product in that spot so they let it by? could that be a possibility?

    thats what it seems like more people are saying they are getting pin sized holes to hole puncher size now in the packages.
    <br/>
    but why would they be letting them go through they have to be hitting something, no?

    and to the OP i wouldnt really feel safe ordering from the NL just my  $  02
