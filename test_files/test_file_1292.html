    I got an order sent but because it took a long time didn't arrive till after I moved and it wasn't able to be delivered even though I forwarded my mail and tracking said it was returned to sender, but today I got a thing in the mail saying to come pick it up at the post office. Does this sound sketchy and should I just take the loss? I figured if it was a CD they could just come to my house but who knows how they do it here

    I'd be cautious.  I read somewhere on here that the only time USPS can open the mail is if it is non deliverable to the return address and the actual address.  If they opened it, obviously that's an issue.  What was the time frame for all of this?

    It was undeliverable like a week or so ago, and I found out it's at the post office today. The return address was in EU and I'm in North America, seems like that would be fast shipping times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll probably just take the loss as I already figured it was gone

    Why wouldn't you go pick it up? I doubt where you live is so flush with cash that they can just waste it on pointless stakeouts of post offices.

    It seems the core of the issue here is you've recently moved and supposedly used the USPS Mail Forwarding Service: https://www.usps.com/manage/forward-mail.htm which for some reason did not work as intended. I'm not that familiar with the rules for this but unless they state all Forwarded Mail must be picked up at any center there's something strange with them requiring a pickup all of a sudden.  :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best way of figuring this out would be finding some specific information on how the USPS Mail Forwarding Service has worked for others. I assume USPS works uniformly all over the US?

    If i were you i would just give the PO its at a call and tell them to have Whatever it is sent your new address like you asked for them to do when you gave them the request to forward your mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They will let your parcel sit at the PO 5 days before they attempt to return it to the Sender. Was the vendor requesting Sighing upon delivery? or did the type of shipping require it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes certain types of shipping for international packages will require a Sig.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like i said though, just request that it be sent out with your normal mail to your new address, and also tell them to make sure they are not loosing any of your mail since you moved and make sure its on their file the forward address, make sure they have it noted and the address is correct. If they say they cant send it out with regular mail, ask them why, an give them a line of shit how your not able to drive to get there. See what the issue is an go from their.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Depdning on what they say about the parcel, is if i would go get it or not.
