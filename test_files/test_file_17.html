    i had my pack oct early to mid 20's.  I myself did not use tracking same vendor have numerous orders! Now, i need some advice, I live in New york and my packs always go to ISC-New york and I am  wondering with the power going off and all.  I heard some people with tracking say their orders were re routed? can anyone who is waiting on a pack shipped around this time. That is international. and was to go to or did go to ISC-NEW York?
    <br/>
    could you let me know similar situations. are you still waiting
    <br/>
    was it re routed to a different hub?
    <br/>
    how delayed is your pack.
    <br/>
    anything that can help me please. I got a order of cancer medication for cancer patients obviously!  Please any info and input would be greatly appreciated!
    <br/>
    from vets to noobies let me know and i appreciate it and I always give
    <br/>
    +1 for your time and good information!
    <br/>
    thank you in advance! i hope to hear  information soon
    <br/>

    Placed an order from Europe and was marked in transit October 13th. Still waiting on it, so 23 days+ now. Honestly have no idea where it is - if it's stuck in ISC New York, somewhere back in Europe or if it was confiscated by Customs. Am hoping it will get here soon, and am hoping yours does too. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, ISC-New York processes something like 700,000 pieces of mail daily. If they shut down even for 2 days, that's a backlog of 1.4 million pieces of mail. Things might get delayed a bit until everything gets back up and running again.

    You know I was just thinking about your situation, shutdem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't have tracking, you really don't know if it went out the 25th. It could have been picked up by the mail on Friday, the 26th. Then it would have to clear customs in the UK before getting sent to the US. I wouldn't be shocked if it was in UK customs on the 27th, a Saturday, and then shipped off to New York that day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which means it probably hit ISC NY that Monday or so, which was when the storm was stopping everything. So it seems like your package may have hit NYC right as the storm was hitting. I know that New York isn't running at full speed, which means you might wait a bit longer sadly until you get your pack.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mine has been sitting in customs for two days now, which is crazy, because my express packages are usually in and out of customs within 24 hours. But i'm sure they're super backed up right now, so I may have a few more days wait before it gets out of customs. I'd imagine customs in NY is even more backed up.

    well mine was mailed 24 early, i say 25th giving it a day to be accepted and processed.  So, i think i am sure but when exactly did the storm hit ny and how long was isc-ny out of commission?
    <br/>
    thanks man i appreciate the info man! i mean i want to think that it is just held up and hope it gets pushed threw with them trying to get caught up! but yes this is true even if left the 25 it had to be processed out customs by london,Then it takes about 2 days to arrive to the us so do the math that puts it in there about the 28th? IDK without tracking i really is just guessing but you are right it could very well be! but let me know how long ny-ISC was down 2 days right 28th - 30th im not sure?

    I dont think anyone outside the post office really knows how long ISC was down. But we can't forget that even if ISC was operating, I doubt it was operating at full capacity. I'm sure a lot of workers weren't able to come in leaving it short staffed. Which means they'd get a lot less work done.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also ISC required JFK airport to be back up and running, which it wasn't until atleast the 29 or 30. And even when it started back up, it wasnt at full operation. Plus, there were a lot of cancelled flights that had to come in first.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So bottom line is that mail is realistically backed up by over a week at this point. The delay is probably going to be more like two weeks when all is said and done. I know i've already been waiting a week for my package. But again, it's in customs and who knows how long it's going to stay there. I'm hoping only a day or two more. But I've heard people having packages in customs for 10-20 days. It's a crap shoot.

    oh mine says it was shipped on the 20 of oct. so that was a saturday. mail isnt on sunday. so id say on the 22nd it was movin. maybe about 4 days to get going to move out.about 1day movin oversea and another 3-5 days in the states. but the storm was like the 30-31 so that can tack on another 5 days to be safe

    Hey all,  my international pack was released from customs last night and made it to me today. That's a bout a 5-day delay from average shipping. the good news is that anyone who still hasn't received their package could get it soon.

    before SR i had a order not show up international of course. For 6weeks! and it was normally a 10day tops thing, I too am on the east coast in Ny upstate.  I have been waiting since the 24th.  So i am guessing it should be here soon. I mean it should have hit usa like the 28th the day they lost power. So, I am sure they are backed up. Damn so, I hope it shows tomorrow I am waiting on cancer meds for group of caner patients that need it! This sux, I mean my heart goes out to all of those who where effected by the hurricane, lives lost. damage,,,,ect I truly wish the best for the loved ones of the lost and the damages atleast can be rebuilt,
    <br/>
    but i got sick people here that need their meds so i really hope that they go things going full speed and are moving ass to catch up. Also, I hope that being backed up created the "fuck it lets catch up attitude"! This way alot of our awaiting SR users get their packs threw! i mean that one guy had his sent the 31st from canada express and got it today well the 6th and he was in the US. but they re routed it to chicago or jamaca ny instead of ISC-Ny. Which is odd, So, I do not know where my pack is, if out of customs, on it way or will be in my box tomorrow! but i fucking hope so! these guys need their meds!  Also, other SR guys need to catch a buzz ha
    <br/>
    but if you got a pack on the way and delayed because of Sandy this bitch of a hurricane fucking up our shipment times! let us know about it! if  you have tracking what it says? that would help us who dont! have an idea of wtf could be going on!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well you know i always give a +1 for some helpful info! thanks in advance hope to hear more circumstances. Well i mean i hope everyone got theirs but even if you did just today and it was let and you have tracking let us know the date sent if you dont mind and what tracking said when the storm hit if on east coast!
    <br/>
    thank you again hope to hear more and metaphoe I hope we get them all too soon like today!

    Waiting 20+ days from SE Asia to East Coast.

    It's important to remember that even if your package hit customs a week before Sandy came, it still could be backup.  I've had stuff in customs for upward of 2 weeks when they're just behind w/o a hurricane so if you shipment got their a week before Sandy then it might have just been clearing as the hurricane hit and they had to shut it down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd be interested to hear what mail they're prioritizing.  Are they working chronologically (oldest mail goes out first) or doing it as mail comes in and doing the backed up hurricane mail when they have time.  If it's the second one then some of us may be waiting quite awhile  ???

    Update! pack left the 24th and arrived TODAY.  like to always let people know about my post if i start one. So to
    <br/>
    pilsn420 that means they got it that day i know registered mail is the slowest since has NO time period of delivery i had reg mail from asia sit in customs for 2 weeks and it did not update until after it was delivered! so do not expect it too, You'll seriously have it before you see it update on there. from customs when its registered mail. but keep it going just letting you know there is hope! if your vendor is 100! as mine is, it will get here. Not to mention my friend who works for post office  in upstate NY. not customs. he said that ny pushed out like 3 times as much mail since monday! so i hope all of yours arrives safely! let us know! again thank you all! this storm was hell for alot of people! so im glad its over and from what i heard ny customs is "caught up" so let us know
    <br/>
    thank you all good luck
