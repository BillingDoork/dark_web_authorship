    I'm fairly certain that the drugs went missing from the time the vendor packaged and placed in the mail until the time it arrived in your hands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sticking to that theory of what happened.
    <br/>

    did you finalize? if not go to resolution centre and explain it.

    finalizing means you were happy with your order

    not sure what went wrong but solving the problem and getting my item would be #1 for me before investigating my mailman etc...

    No seriously, I think nobody can tell you what happened. But it doesn't look like it was LE at all...

    I did FE before the package was sent.. Don't think it was LE myself man they would have seized the whole thing and not just the drugs haha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After chatting with the vendor he is more annoyed with this than i am as his stealth is top notch was a greedy postal worker somewhere on its journey that wanted what it was hiding in and then seen the drugs and just sent the package..

    Mind if I ask what you ordered? Was it something that could be smelled through the package?

    I've never understood why a mailman would take something out of the package, and then STILL DELIVER THE EMPTY PACKAGE. Makes no sense to me.

    Maybe this would be a good time to make sure you have a clean house, not call the people you usually call, not email the people you usually mail, not visit the people you usually visit?

    Don't know how much you had shipped, but in case of a sham parcel being delivered to build a conspiracy charge.

     Long shot here - but was your package from DubGx2?  Evidently he is pulling a FE scam (I don't directly have evidence of this, just read it on the forum).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If that is the case, take a breath of relief.  If not, I would clean house - ESPECIALLY since you said you signed for it.  Although, if it were a CD/LE, you wouldn't be able to respond to this message.

    Wasn't DubGx2 haha and im still here so i reckon it was a sticky fingered postal worker as i know for a fact it was really sent as i personally know this vendor haha but if i hear anything back by customs or anything i will let you's know but i doubt it.

    I had an import package arrive ripped open and you could see contents. It could have easily fallen out but didn't. Lucky it was a true stealth ship.

    And you totally trust your vendor right? If it was shipped from another country then customs probably has it. Mail Carriers probably wouldn't go through the trouble to steal your property. If anyone you know is aware of how you receive drugs then I'd be more suspect of those people. Especially if they are highly addicted.

    I had a friend buy a gift for me online once and it shipped from England. When I got the package it was empty and had customs tape on it. This gift was nothing illegal at all and they kept it. The same company said they would reship it and this time from their warehouse in Canada and the package came through fine. This has led me to believe that English customs agents are corrupt. The gift wasn't even that cool really and it cost about 20 bucks so I can't see why they would want it.

    How common is this? Do they reseal with customs tape, or stealthily reseal so it looks untouched?
