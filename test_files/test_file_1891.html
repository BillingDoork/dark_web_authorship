    If you put a rough fake address from another country will they check this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EG.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Street name is correct, but the street number and business name are made up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will this pass or get flagged?

    Can't speak from experience but I would guess that the only time you'd have to worry about it is while it's being shipped within the country you are faking the address in.  I can't really imagine another country's customs going to such a length to make sure the street number's correct.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, some more context would help.  You comfortable saying which country it's coming from and where it's going?

    Yeah, there is an inspector in charge of this.  I'm not sure what country you are from but they all have them.  The inspector sits at his desk and each parcel that comes in from another country goes to a bin beside him.  He pulls them out one by one and if it is from, say, Thailand- he starts looking on the internet for that exact address.  If he doesn't find it, he calls directory assistance and asks for the party.

    You are joking, right?
