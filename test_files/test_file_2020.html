    That's right fellow Aussie sisters and brothers it time we band together and say no more!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Over the last month I have used a couple of trusted mates in the EU and States to send me orders which they received. So the deal was different weights up to 14g and we noted the date and time of posting in the country of origin. And now for the results....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EU - 5 items posted over a four week period one for each day of the week. All days exclude weekends and PH.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Posted Day.    Transit Time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mon.  AM.            6 days arrived the following Monday
    <br/>
    Tues.  PM.            5 days  arrived the following Monday
    <br/>
    Wed.   AM.           4 days arrived the following Monday
    <br/>
    Thur.   PM.           5 days arrived the following Thursday.
    <br/>
    Fri.      AM.            4 days arrived the following Thursday
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USA same criteria as above.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mon  AM.            4 days Arrived that Friday
    <br/>
    Tues.  PM            6 days arrived the following Tuesday
    <br/>
    Wed.  AM.           4 days arrived the following Tuesday
    <br/>
    Thur.  PM.            6 days arrived the following Friday
    <br/>
    Friday. AM.          6 working days but it went over two weekends so felt like a long time but in business days clearly not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping was Priority with both countries..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what does this indicate? Well a fair bit! In fact it is consistent with some great vendors I use. So the question needs to be asked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why do some vendors deliver time and time again, yet others have "difficulties"? I shall leave this as an open ended question for you all to contemplate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I am not naming any vendors. This thread is a shot across the bow so to speak. That anymore shenanigans will no longer be tolerated! So if the is quantitative evidence pointing to a selective scam vendor or SSV as they will be branded then this is the place to name and shame.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australia is a lucrative market, and I would hazard a guess to be maybe even number 2 so vendors need to get some focus and start looking after your customers! The great vendors have realized this and has certainly tapped into this market. Focusing on great stealth shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now on the flip side rogue buyers and out there also, and I believe our beloved vendors have an absolute right to voice there protests also. So again come to this thread with quantitative evidence and let the "mob" deal with this small element. Trust me when I say it Pisses me off when scam buyers take advantage if kick arse vendors, it does fuck it up for everyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So lets call this a "Truce"! Ok you got some easy money out of us, let's focus on being legitimately good and your profits will grow!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    i heard a rumour that all the decent genuine vendors who operate as effectively as your experience hoffa all operate in stealth mode and have a steady stream of loyal customers they are comfortable to deal with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the public vendors fall into categories as small/starter trying to get established, OR clone scammers (mostly selective so their stats can seem ok)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    think about it- if you were a genuine vendor and this is your livelihood you would want to hide your activity from curious LE and noisy newbs who flood this place. I mean look at pf's review thread. what an ABORTION. but what about Heisenberg? he's still here and the REAL KING and going stronger than ever, quietly in stealth.

    Hey Hoff,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not doubting you, but those times seem really short. My shortest time to Sydney from the USA has been 10 days (inc weekend) and an average of 14 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EU shortest was 14 days (inc weekend) and an average of 16 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canada shortest 10 days (inc weekend) and an average of 14 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just an FYI

    chem eng / actuary here and I feel the same.

    <br/>
    I sit here all f'ing day getting things from the US and UK in 6-8 business days. legal or illegal. I'm sick to death of vendors and their shitty postage of items blaming authorities.  The delays in reception ARE the vendors... because...well.. I have a database which tells me avg delivery times over an entire inventory and they are significantly shorter durations and well.. THEY ALL FUCKING ARRIVE! (legal/illegal again...guess what...businesses do illegal shit as well... who knew?! ;) ) I was in Indo-FUCKING-nesia this year and I sent back a plastic bag of fucking hash and shrooms and guess what? they were there when I got home! I feel that one in 5 of my orders is actually lost/stolen/seized and 4/5 is just some vendor screwing there pooch and throwing away a label marked 'Australia' on reading it. The numbers never lie (unless you want them to ;-) )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I use SR less now (past 2 months)  as I think a lot of people pull the 'Aus customs card' and send nothing after you FE. I will agree that in terms of share of SR users, we have above average here (literacy / computer access / drug prices!) and it is probably wise for people to cater for this market hole. Especially when all the Seps and EU trash whinge about the prices of this bargain basement priced shit. whinging about price/quality is one thing... whinging about people blatantly fucking you over in a deal is another.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In saying that , fuck it. I ran out of SR goods and haven't felt better in months ! Surfing has never felt easier!

    trust nobody, even if you are the type to suck a penis if somebody just does what you paid them to do.

    Fucking perfectly put. I feel my SR days are drawing to a close as I continually get fucked over by this bullshit. I now have realized that I would've spent the same amount just getting from the streets then going on here (but the quality for us aussies, street vs SR, is just fucked, too tempting) But tbh I can't wait to close my account on SR cause its just all to easy for scamming cunts to make money.

    Wish I could give you a +1 hoffa, that was some tight shit you blurted out  :)  Provocative title, but fuckit.

    Let's look forward ay?  If I was a UK vendor I'd be making a fucking killing right about now. Cheggit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Post a private listing or 10, target us Aussies, deal with guys with good stats / heaps of transactions, charge a reasonable price allowing for better than average stealth, and make a killing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a fucking no brainer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So charge $100 a gram for molly with a guaranteed delivery.  Even if you lose 10-30% of shipments, you're still ahead.  At $100 a gram, the buyers are still ahead compared to the bullshit local prices. Win/win.

    DHL/FedEx is NOT slow. as posted previously from another person, I get stuff within 5 business days from UK/Germany with FedEx , under 7-8 working days from the US. If they had this option i would use it. I have no drugs at home so they can kick down my door and waste my/their time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I like that some SR vendors think they are savvier than (probably) a lot of us here working with international logistics or mail, but the reality is, they are just stupid fucking dealers with a internet connection. I know what they are posting is bollocks as mail is mail... and pretty predictable with very few exceptions. The reality is that they are overburdened with orders and have shit house mailing techniques which results in your money being flushed down the toilet. When I am OS, i send my stash home and it always arrives. 100% success rate. I am no genius, you just need to be careful. Something they are clearly not since the media explosion of SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    make your SR transactions carefully folks. dont waste your hard earned money (cost of living here is ridiculous enough) . SR Drugs are fun, but so is a beer or 2 for ten bucks. Sit tight and wait for SR to flood mail systems across the world and try again then :) Keep orders small (easier to conceal) unless you are dealing. Factoring in risk is part of your game though I guess!

    I dunno guys, had a few letters from genuine legit .eu RC vendors go missing in the last few months (before then, 100% success), 3/4 missing in the last few months.  Definitely sent, and resent. No scam, just... vaporized into thin air somewhere in the post...  :o

    I've had no problems with fredthebaker, Tyl3r Durden, and IvoryUK shipping to Australia. All have very high quality items and arrive within 2-3 weeks.

    The only vendor on SR i've had problems with is trojan. His DMT never arrived, no customs letter. No one reads other peoples' mail in my household, so that is a non-issue. Here is a screenshot of our message log: http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=607cc6c12239468f5ddacc8dba1e61bd.png

    Well cheers cunts for the support, my inbox is full lol. But like I said don't stay silent, fucking blurt it out. And while your at it don't fucking give a vendor a 5 for making you FE fuck that make them earn it! Give 1,2 or if your a soft cock a 3. Change it once the goods come through. Fucking vendors tell you all the time give me a 5 and you can always change it. Nope earn the 5.

     Well cheers cunts for the support, my inbox is full lol. But like I said don't stay silent, fucking blurt it out. And while your at it don't fucking give a vendor a 5 for making you FE fuck that make them earn it! Give 1,2 or if your a soft cock a 3. Change it once the goods come through. Fucking vendors tell you all the time give me a 5 and you can always change it. Nope earn the 5.

    haha... Yeh, we love you too Hoffa!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We are really torn with the whole leaving 1's or 2's with a FE...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be honest, we have been a little annoyed when people have done it to us in the past, especially because we pride ourselves on successful deliveries and honesty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, most will successfully receive their order and then never update the feedback rating! Then we are stuck with a 1 or 2 after excellent customer service &amp; delivering the goods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are dodgy buyers &amp; sellers out there, let's try to reward the honest ones and work together to stamp out corruption, dishonesty and negativity on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We will be available 24/7 standing by for your orders and do not forget our current specials...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have a great weekend folks!

    I never considered this as an idea and top marks to you hoffa. give them low score until your receive is you are FORCED to FE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also on this, u reckon its fair to tell them only possible of 4/5 stars if they only do a 50% max refund?
    <br/>

    I would say give them a 5/5 for 50% refund. It is more than generous to offer any refund considering shit gets confiscated...especially when they upheld their end and sent you the goods.

    Interesting thread, especially as I'll be moving back to Sydney in a year or two!  I'm also going to Aus for a holiday soon, so am considering getting some orders shipped out to greet me...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I get the fact that orders can take between 1 and 3 weeks to reach Aus, and some don't arrive, but what I want to know is this....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For all you Aussies, what % of your total SR orders have not arrived?   How bad is the problem of orders not reaching you, be it suspected 'selective scamming' or simply efficient customs identifying drug envelopes and destroying them?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To share some UK data with you, between me and my two mates (also UK) who use Silk Road, we've placed a total of 45 orders, and every single one of them has arrived.  Many of these are from the Netherlands, some from Germany, a couple from Canada/US and some domestic.  100% success rate.  Quality hasn't always been the best, and some late deliveries (3 weeks from Germany to UK!), but they've always arrived.  Like most people we've found our favorite and trusted vendors, so are mainly using these ones for all our requirements.
    <br/>

    Love the thread hoff! Give it to the cunts who dont ship our shit....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im not going to accuse any vendor of scamming, well except pf and sesampino.... Im simply going to list who i have not received from and some small details....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First non arrival...  Crystal wife... very quick to blame customs and offer part refund, first and only order...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pf... obviously never sent as 20+ aussies never received either...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mimm... Few successful orders then a no show to an addy that was 100% successful.... Made new order to different addy and again was 100% successful too but that never arrived either....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    juergen... Few successful orders then a no show.... has promised reship.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mr fire.... successful order of mdma that was ordered a day after a speed order was placed but a no show of the speed....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other than that my time here has been great....
    <br/>
    I will say again.... I am not accusing any vendor of scamming just informing the aus community of my non arrivals so they can make better decisions.....

      I recently had a letter take 17 days from being marked in transit from the US, should normally only take around 9 days or faster depending on country of origin, I think there has been lengthy delays recently the US end.

     I had a 1/4G from Oliver take 17 days, but thats was during Pangea, and the long weekend, I had 6 hours to finalise, when the postie came, talki about cutting it fine. Anything longer than 2 weeks in normal circumstances is a red flag to me.

     Europe can take up to 20 days in our experience. US should be about 10 days.

    Yes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your addy is being scoped your in a full blown investigation.  A full blow investigation costs fucking heaps. Costing the government heaps means your fucked. Ive heard plenty of people being done for stuff but having other stuff on the way and they've been shitting them self only for the next orders to show up untouched lol. Moreso from the online steroid scene as the stuff we are doing here has been going on for decades with those guys. All of the instructions regarding mailing, controlled deliverys etc on here comes from the online steroid scene. DPR is an Admin also on a very prominent clearweb steroid website.

     If your addy is being scoped your in a full blown investigation.  A full blow investigation costs fucking heaps. Costing the government heaps means your fucked. Ive heard plenty of people being done for stuff but having other stuff on the way and they've been shitting them self only for the next orders to show up untouched lol. Moreso from the online steroid scene as the stuff we are doing here has been going on for decades with those guys. All of the instructions regarding mailing, controlled deliverys etc on here comes from the online steroid scene. DPR is an Admin also on a very prominent clearweb steroid website.

    Why? Steroids are illegal aswell, this website is dedicated to them. Most of what we go by here in regards to shipping  has come from years of trial and error in the online steroid scene.
    <br/>
    Do you not get that Tor can be used on the normal clearnet and that is precisely what it was released into the public arena for, so people in China and Iran could access the clearnet without being filtered.

    Speechless... On another note, diggers IPA is sold at bunnings, so he's telling the truth there.

I suppose we all make mistakes, but still!  :-\ He obviously did some careful planning to ensure the scam fell into place. Joey check your pm.

    Well well well all this attention.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Jo I suggest you calm down. And before you speak to me again, here is some survival advice bitch. Delete all your shit and then post a public apology to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or maybe if you would prefer to do it in private I can just visit you?  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Get your facts straight and then calm the fuck down choose one of the above options and give me a yell!

    'shiznit' always the one to stir up drama did u really have to bring this topic back alive by asking where hoffa is? like I said that shiznit mother fucker knows where everyone is.   ;D

    anyone having luck with MIMM lately or are they just getting profiled &amp; or busier which is leading to non-deliveries to our shores? Our canadian friend used to be around 10 days over many many times and now seem to be a bit more of a hit and miss? Still a chance for this latest one.. but I miss the 10 days and its here.

    fellow aussie checking in!
    <br/>
    Only new to this site so apologies in advance if I seem like a complete idiot - had 2 transactions so far. 1 international 1 domestic. international was a bunch of anabolic related stuff from vendor flaxceed, waited 3 months and nothing came but have contacted him and he said he will resend, however he now has no active listings now and my message with my new posting address remains unread so i'm a little concerned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Domestic order was some pot from 1StopOz and I used another fake name, when I went into the post office to grab it (express post bag, unsure if it could have fit in a PO box or they intentionally wanted to bring me into the shop) although there was no signature required they (the manager came behind the guy serving me) were asking me "what is the name on the parcel?, what is your name?, do you know what the package is?" prior to going out back and getting it, and in the end they said they would send back to sender as it wasn't mine - I really didn't know what to do so I let it go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously the latter order got through fine i'm moreso recounting this for some feedback as to what I should have done... it's really depressing i've spent over $400 on this site and as of yet have nothing to show for it. Should I change address after these encounters? Should I use a fake name (I did for both of these orders), and if I don't, cant they just charge me with whatever it is? I'm using a PO box atm as i'm still living with inquisitive parents. Really sucks hearing all these people getting stuff fine and it just feels like i'm getting fucked. Further is anything is this post incriminating? I use a different name as my buyer acc (sorry I feel so paranoid lol)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also please note communication and attitude of both the vendors was flawless, and I am in no way making any accusations against flax as he seems like a genuine, friendly guy and i'm hopeful I will get a successful resend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry this was such a long post and perhaps this isn't the best thread to discuss it in but I feel like fellow aussies can perhaps shed a little more insight than other countries due to our experience with the postal system here. Any feedback or tips for future are greatly appreciated

    spiceman is right. you cant teach this shit. read read read. i cant even imagine how much bullshit newbies have to read through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    at aupost, names dont matter. i.e if you get something at your house, it can be any name, if you have to pick it up, as it wont fit, or needs sig, you will just have to show id proving you reside at that address. its your flatmates ;) and he finishes work late.
    <br/>
    (this is a matter of opinion.. some will say dont lie at all, as you will incriminate yourself further should you be getting looked at..
    <br/>
    however, unless its a significant order no-one gives a shit. it will just disappear.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    not sure how your express bags work... same as pobox? pobox you can have any name also, or at the least, have an 'authorized' fake name on there, to hide your real name from FB vendor stalkers ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i am guessing, had you said its your flatmate, he asked you to pick it up, it would have been sweet. unless your right and they wanted you to get into the shop. has someone been profiled? who knows.
    <br/>
    personally i wouldnt risk anymore for a little while to that specific address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    far as poboxes go, dont get a small one, bigger sizes dont cost much more, and its hella safer than having to walk into the shop on camera.

     fellow aussie checking in!
     <br/>
     Only new to this site so apologies in advance if I seem like a complete idiot - had 2 transactions so far. 1 international 1 domestic. international was a bunch of anabolic related stuff from vendor flaxceed, waited 3 months and nothing came but have contacted him and he said he will resend, however he now has no active listings now and my message with my new posting address remains unread so i'm a little concerned.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Domestic order was some pot from 1StopOz and I used another fake name, when I went into the post office to grab it (express post bag, unsure if it could have fit in a PO box or they intentionally wanted to bring me into the shop) although there was no signature required they (the manager came behind the guy serving me) were asking me "what is the name on the parcel?, what is your name?, do you know what the package is?" prior to going out back and getting it, and in the end they said they would send back to sender as it wasn't mine - I really didn't know what to do so I let it go.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Obviously the latter order got through fine i'm moreso recounting this for some feedback as to what I should have done... it's really depressing i've spent over $400 on this site and as of yet have nothing to show for it. Should I change address after these encounters? Should I use a fake name (I did for both of these orders), and if I don't, cant they just charge me with whatever it is? I'm using a PO box atm as i'm still living with inquisitive parents. Really sucks hearing all these people getting stuff fine and it just feels like i'm getting fucked. Further is anything is this post incriminating? I use a different name as my buyer acc (sorry I feel so paranoid lol)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also please note communication and attitude of both the vendors was flawless, and I am in no way making any accusations against flax as he seems like a genuine, friendly guy and i'm hopeful I will get a successful resend.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sorry this was such a long post and perhaps this isn't the best thread to discuss it in but I feel like fellow aussies can perhaps shed a little more insight than other countries due to our experience with the postal system here. Any feedback or tips for future are greatly appreciated

      spiceman is right. you cant teach this shit. read read read. i cant even imagine how much bullshit newbies have to read through.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      at aupost, names dont matter. i.e if you get something at your house, it can be any name, if you have to pick it up, as it wont fit, or needs sig, you will just have to show id proving you reside at that address. its your flatmates ;) and he finishes work late.
      <br/>
      (this is a matter of opinion.. some will say dont lie at all, as you will incriminate yourself further should you be getting looked at..
      <br/>
      however, unless its a significant order no-one gives a shit. it will just disappear.)
      <br/>
      <br/>
      not sure how your express bags work... same as pobox? pobox you can have any name also, or at the least, have an 'authorized' fake name on there, to hide your real name from FB vendor stalkers ;)
      <br/>
      <br/>
      i am guessing, had you said its your flatmate, he asked you to pick it up, it would have been sweet. unless your right and they wanted you to get into the shop. has someone been profiled? who knows.
      <br/>
      personally i wouldnt risk anymore for a little while to that specific address.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      far as poboxes go, dont get a small one, bigger sizes dont cost much more, and its hella safer than having to walk into the shop on camera.

    thanks for all the info mate, I guess my lack of experience with the postage system is one of the reasons im so wary about it all, I really don't know how seriously they take these sort of things, and the thought of LE having my package makes me concerned lol.
    <br/>
    I had considered the though of saying it was a friend or something similar but I was worried if they knew, and then further looked into it I would be pretty well screwed.
    <br/>
    Yeah good call on the address, I was only not sending it to my residential address due to fear or either implicating my parents if something went south, or them straight up catching me - however as I'm currently home most days I guess it's likely easier for me to just let the postman leave the package at the door. Do you think the post office would make a connection to monitor mail to my residential address after what has happened with my PO box? As I said I really don't know how seriously they take this sort of thing, or what amount classifies as worthy of investigation.

    Good to hear that Flax is delivering. We got a heap of respect for the Steroid sellers, it's hard to get this stuff shipped in with good stealth. Customs have a hard on for roids in the recent years, heaps still get in from what we hear!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any issues with gear from Thailand? We have heard that a lot of the roids from the Thai chemists are fakes... any truth?

    importing kilos or tons is what warrants an investigation.
    <br/>

    Matrix customs have a hard on for confiscating roids because they use them themselves and its a great way of getting free-gear. Steroid stealth is no different to narcotic stealth really. Steroids are legal in thailand also thats why so many people go over there on 3 month "holidays" so like anything sure there would be some fakes but the majority of it is legit. its like saying " i heard some people sell fake powders as real speed" of course it happens but the majority of time it doesnt.

    good on ya though, never be to careful. if you could see my 1400 posts before they went,  there was some cracking ones in the first 6 months when we were all learning, and also some shockers when i first joined.. before the masses came, and the govt started to take notice, now we just cant post shit openly. yet, we seem to be the only ones doing it.. i never see the poms or sepos raving on about stuff they get in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    interesting how you do get sick of the same posts though innit.. fuck knows how mokshaft keeps his composure.. maybe its all the weed he smokes. ;D
    <br/>
    did you ever find your yayo dealer?.. i remember that being the only thing you used to talk about hahah

    I forgot about this thread, stumbled upon it looking for an old post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had a no-show from Boymaster.
    <br/>
    Oliver, 1st late ship was just over 2 weeks(expected)
    <br/>
    Oliver the 2nd order came to finalise-and arrived that day, 3 weeks.
    <br/>
    Oliver again, 3rd time its 3 days from finalise.
    <br/>
    I changed from GE as Oliver's Alpraz powder is stronger, he has poor service.

    C'mon aussie brethren, we need to keep listing our no-shows, scams or otherwise, so at least we can make more informed decisions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've gone from getting everything through in the early days of SR, 45+ international orders, every single one successful, to getting nothing through. I do my research, I select reputable vendors. I change up drops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Recent no show history:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    purestore - scammed for sure along with many others when he absconded with a pile of BTC.
    <br/>
    Limitless - no show, possible admin error, he cancelled the order as soon as I went to resolution centre for full refund.
    <br/>
    MrFireUK - no show, along with a bunch of other Aussies at the same time, 60% refund
    <br/>
    Pfandleiher - scammed for syre along with bunch of others, refund processed by SR admin
    <br/>
    MiMM - no show after 18 days, not holding out much hope
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </dd>
