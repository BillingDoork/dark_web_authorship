    I don't live with my parents anymore and i am wondering whether to send a package,probably containing 25-50 pills, to my parents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had really slow mail and am getting worried. Anyone else send anything back to there parents house? Too risky of a deal?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace.

    It's too risky if your parents are going to snoop. It's up to you...it's really no different than shipping it to your own house...except your parents can find out. Personally, I'd rather not involve my family in my business.

    I personally wouldn't--my mom's way too big a snoop for that, not to mention all the questions she'd no doubt ask about why I suddenly got a package at her house when I haven't lived there for years. Of course, your parents might not be that nosy. Still, given the shitstorm that would come down if my parents ever somehow found out I'd had drugs shipped to their house--yeah, jail would be preferableÂ  :)

    It would still have his name on it, so he would take the fall. I don't see why you' even want to do this. Just brings the element of your parents finding out into it. If it doesnt get caught, you could've sent it to your house, if it does, they find out and you still probably get questioned.

    25-50 pills isn't a lot but what if the cops in your town have nothing better to do then do a CD? Then your mom signs for it or something. Their door will get kicked in and the cops will shoot your parent's dog. Not good,

    I am considering getting the package delivered to my parents as i got very suspicious that 2 packages haven't turned up at my address, and its been over 10 days since i ordered and they don't usually take that long from the vendors i used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was only an idea, i would tell my mum i sent it to her address by mistake or something and it doesn't contain anything exciting!!

    Only you can answer this question. Whats your relationship with your parents like? If i for some reason had to do this, for me, it wouldnt be an issue cause my mother and father both know what im about. So, you tell us.. would sending a dirty package to your parents home be a wise choice? In any matter, best of luck to you.

    I would have to agree with the summary of the above posts.Â  Involving your parents in your dirty shenanigans is a bad idea.Â  It would be a better idea to go up to their doorstep, take a dump, and then ring the bell.Â  Nobody gets hurt, everybody wins.
