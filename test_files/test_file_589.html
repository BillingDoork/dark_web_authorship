    So I made a dumb mistake today. I received the package as expected and so I finalize on it expecting the product to be in there. But when I open the mail I come to find that nothing is inside. Hopefully this was just a honest mistake by the vendor and he'll resolve the problem for me like gentleman; but of course since I've already finalized I'm pretty much screwed if he decides to be an a-hole instead and not to do anything for me. Of course I'll rate him low if he does do that and I will be very sure to name the vendor here. But I'm not going to name him yet; I'm going to wait and see if he'll resolve this problem for me.

    I swear I'm getting tired of being screwed over on this site. I like not to believe the negative stereotypes of drug dealers that the mainstream media pushes but seriously... come on... this is ridiculous.

    I'm sure this is not some super stealthy trick. I've ordered from this vendor before. His product is nowhere in the mail and they aren't LSD taps that would be super easy to hide. There is simply nothing in it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not finalizing until the shit is weighed is a very good idea. But whatever you do, make sure you have the product. I was so stupid. Of course this would be the first time I've ever finalized before opening the package. Just my luck.

    You really shouldnt finalize until you test it, especially with newer vendors.

    I've said it once, and I will say it again: SR needs an insured postage option. Would you pay an extra 20% to have the product insured so you get paid back if it doesn't arrive? I know I would.

    Wadozo, the vendor could offer that as a postage option. Insured postage for tracked and signed letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would have to be tracked and signed or there could be scams. The insurance is to protect against customs interception.

    There's your problem right there. A lot of buyers won't go for that.

    Theoretically a great idea but practically won't work.  :)

    I would not pay 20% I dont loose 1 in 5 packages so loosing a package every now and then is still cheaper. might suck but we are talking econimics. .FE = Finalize Early  by finalizing without seeing the product is just another case.  BTW if they offered insurance it would be a field day for scammers abusing the insurance clauses. Anyproblems I have encountered have been worked out with the Vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just so you know if you would of went to resolution if the vendor had a dcn SR would side with vendor if this was an isolated case. That is why theere are feedback rating to stopvendors from taking advantage of the system. They could scam an order or 2 but there stats would be in the 80% range at best

    Was it an international shipment? Could be customs nabbed it. Did the package look opened and resealed? It's happened to me before and nothing ever came of it, so I wouldn't worry. It's just annoying getting an empty package!!
