    Helllo,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure this has been asked a ton.  However how long between interception and a delivery takes place?  I placed two orders last week, 2 zip's of bud from one vendor and a gram of H from someone else.  Both orders were placed on the same day and both orders shipped on the same day (the 24th).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On Wednesday I got one package in the mail, only has a zip in it.  Message the vendor and he say's he shipped it in two packages through two different drop boxes.  Now since then my other packages show up, I wasn't particularly nervous but kept in contact with the vendor so he didn't think I was screwing him over.  Today he say's he checked the tracking of the second package and nothing shows up, as if it never got picked up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So now I'm a little nervous, the fact that the tracking show's nothing makes me think it was never shipped in the first place.  However paranoia is telling me I'll be getting a knock on my door any day.   How long until I know whether or not I'm in the clear?

    With controlled delivery's they try to execute them on time so that suspicion isn't raised when they try to get you to sign.  If it's been longer than 2-3 weeks you probably won't be getting a CD. It's only been 6 days though, it could just be "lost" and still show up.  Try to work something out with the vendor if it never shows up.

    I wouldn't be that nervous if it wasn't so odd.  It seems to me if it got intercepted the package would have at least been scanned at some point into the system right?  If it's lost I'm somewhat equally nervous, if they find it weeks down the road whatever stealth barriers in place may no longer be effective.
    <br/>

    The vendor's been very communicative, but it's honestly not the money I'm concerned with.  Hopefully I'm being needlessly paranoid.

    It usually isn't a problem if your package is taking long.  It probably got lost or sent on a wrong shipment to somewhere else and USPS basically takes their jolly good time getting it back on track.  I had a zip lost in the USPS void for 3 weeks but it came eventually and I stopped jittering about :)

    Thanks for the reassuring words.  I hope I'm being needlessly paranoid, I've had packages from amazon prime take longer.  However nothing I'd order from Amazon could land me in jail.

    So the package from the second vendor ended up showing up.  Still nothing on the first one.  I'm assuming that if they intercepted something they wouldn't allow something else to slip through?  I'm gonna keep my fingers crossed.
