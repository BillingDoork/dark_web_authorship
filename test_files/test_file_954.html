    No, this is not about mylar bags, this is about something I haven't seen too many people complaining about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many vendors still think that "stealth" only means something that cannot be seen from the outside of the packaging. Yes, it's a minimal definition.
    <br/>
    But hey Vendors, customs officers &amp; post people have hands. They can touch things like you could touch my dick, if I'd let you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This means, if:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) your product (or something suspicious) can be felt from the outside, it is not "stealth". You think throwing your product in an enveloppe and print your labels is enough to call it "stealth", you're wrong. Now the item may arrive safely, but that does not mean it is "stealth". I've received so many letters where you could feel a ziplock bag or pills or else, without too much of an effort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) If upon opening the package, the product can be easily seen,  then it's not "stealth".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok, sorry SR, rant over, I'm feeling good now.

    How do you suggest disguising product inside the envelope without increasing weight? Say, a gram of coke.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Product can always be felt from the outside if you know what you're looking for. It's not practical to spread it evenly across the whole envelope unless a it's a big amount, in which case the envelope will be suspiciously stiff anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nobody should be touching your package looking for drugs, let alone opening it unless it's already suspect.

    True, yet SR is getting known I guess so it's better to evolve faster than LE does.

    Any vendor who thinks "stealth" is just making sure the outside of the package does not look as if it came from a hippies basement, is a bad vendor. Stealth is making sure even if someone is looking for drugs, they can't find them. I ordered from a vendor once who sent ONE pill in a huge flat rate letter. It was a huge surface area, but do enough feeling and you would surely find this huge lump among the flatness.

    I had a vendor send me quarter of bud in a single vacuum seal with absolutely no color barrier or anything in a bubble mailer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could feel the fluffiness through the bubble mail and if the bubble mail had ripped open it would've been game over.  I was surprised it made it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I love when vendors package multiple vacuum seals, then a color barrier and or in disguised item, then an envelope then that envelope in a envelope/bubble mail.

    I've seen some crazy good techniques and some of the worse.

    Flat rate packages take up a big chunk of total boxes USPS handles daily. If you were LE, you would have been fired for sucking at your job.

    specifically the small flat rate boxes, especially with obvious fake names or bullshit business stickers on it.  I would be fired for sucking at my LE job.  Five years, no arrest, and where's all that confiscated evidence? lol  Sorry if I offended you, if your a vendor you probably are one of those suffering from lack of creativity.

    Dude, calm down. I simply stated a fact. Also, look at my feedback. I offer the best stealth you could possibly get on SR. Don't matter what box I put it in, you won't find it unless your looking very hard.

    "    so I hate to have to leave this sort of review for this vendor because I give the benefit of the doubt to all vendors that communicate often and quickly, makes them seem like there on the ball. so I ordered a 1g sample of Hawaiian, but was told before I bought that if I ordered his sample that he would give me 1g of sky walker and one of Hawaiian.... so who wouldn't jump on that. so I arrive at his vendor page and see he is charging close to 15 dollars for a *free sample * then I had to pay an extra 16 for shipping... at this point I feel a little dumb but go on with the order anyway... again dumb off me but I did a lot of research on the vendor and checked feedback and reviews that were from older members of the site... so I thought let's try. so I buy it and then he tells me I will only receive the skywalker first and then the Hawaiian after, so I think to myself why wouldn't he just give 2gs of what he had, instead of sending one through Sr transaction and one through the mail after? I received the first time and only gram abt five days later, when I paid for priority, then he says he sent the second one and it says deliverd so he gives me a tracking code that says it was sent to the WRONG address 3 days ago, I let him know it was wrong and that he could keep the Lil btcs he got but I'm going to let my review and feedback reflect so here goes shipping 3/5- arrived five days after It was marked in transit and I paid for priority which costed me 17 dollars... U could have just listed it as first class if it wouldn't be here in 4 days at the max... and a gram short stealth4/5- stealth was pretty good but Def could have been flagged as it had only one visual barrier that was almost like it was already opened, but the gram was tripped sealed in mylar bags so that was why I was generous with the 4 product-5/5 I can't deny the skywalker was Damn good... But it was still a g light and the other g you so called sent to me is in state no where near me. so overall I give this guy a 3/5 I mean I'd rate it 5/5 if it were actually a free or cheap sample just out of respect.

    All that stealth aint no good if you can' even send it to the right house.

    Hopefully you realize how bad information spreads.  I will thank you for promoting me however, and you are also welcome to my time and free publicity.   You are quoting a scam buyer in that review.  I already pulled his card and exposed him on the forums.  If you read anything in its entirety instead of pulling things out of context and looking stupid you would notice the entire thread with the entire story there.   That clown actually gave me a higher overall rating but when I put his bullshit out there he went back and changed it to a one.  Use that brain of yours to think why someone would write a full review as such where the lowest rating on anything is 3/5, and then go and give the overall score a 1/5.  lol  Just like you he got emotional when I told him the truth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now tell me what fact I am pulling out of my ass!  The fact that you can't handle the truth?  The fact that you clearly cannot handle criticism?
    <br/>

    Don't kill the messenger my man!

    all envelope i receive,have large gaps stealth

    1:open and close easily without being noticed (use a super glue would be the minimum)

    2:inside there are simple white sheets, nothing in writing!

    3:a one vacuum only

    it is clear that many sellers are amateurs,and this hurts a lot because now runs much drugs by mail

    There is a lack of professionalism in every industry.  It's best to order a small amount from a vendor first to see what their packaging is about.  If it's not up to par in your view I see no reason why,  if the product is good and you like the vendor, to request that the vendor use different methods.  If they won't, simply take your business elsewhere!

    It's worth a forum search to turn up old threads on this topic. It's a recurring theme, for good reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I tend to refer to this concept as "internal stealth", since the majority seems to agree that nondescript packaging still counts as stealth, of a sort (and I don't disagree). For those of you saying "how would you disguise X", think it over awhile, or find better vendors. No, really. That said, I still use a vendor who provides bare internal stealth (sealed and wrapped inside, but no disguise), though I may rethink that. If the feedback system weren't broken (see another long sequence of threads in the forums) competition might force vendors to better methods, but it isn't happening. As is, I feel like trying a new vendor is taking my life into my hands. Which, of course, it exactly is.

    There is more than one way to skin a cat.  Your stealth should be just that "Stealth" simply throwing it in a box that everyone else uses does not constitute stealth in my opinion.  This is a tough topic to talk about as a vendor, because of its nature you must leave many things out of the discussion.  Much reseach into the subject as you stated and a lil common sense however should lead most on the right track!

    ok but put a substance in the letter, close with spit and send it,is a mediocre job
    <br/>
    never seen the mylar from 5 different sellers
    <br/>
    x-ray escape, utopia
    <br/>
    at least write something inside that describes the'' product'' and pack,''the stuff'' it with the cardboard, for example 2 playing cards from the colorful print
    <br/>
    a bit of imagination
    <br/>
    when the stuff does not come (happened to me) I'm the liar
