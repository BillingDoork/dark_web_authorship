    Howdy folks -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been planning my entry to become a seller here for a couple months but have run into a snag testing one facet ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was planning to use prepaid Visa gift cards which I buy for cash at random stores, to purchase priority mail labels from usps.com. However, during a test run, the Visa gift card is declined. I read that you sometimes have to register the card with the card provider, so I did that but they only ask for a zip code, no other information. But it still doesn't work, I get a 'there has been an unexpected error, please contact this number' message.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there a way to do this with such cards, or a better way? Thanks!

    You are close, just mixed up one little detail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You want to get the $100 American Express card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOT the reloadable ones, the gift card ones. BigBox stores have them in the check out aisles. They cost about $105.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1 hour after you buy it. it will be active.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I do not know about using them for online postage, but  you could go to a PO and use the machine there to print "metered" or custom price postage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Measure it out to use the card all at once, $100 worth of postage. then you are good for a bit.

    Couldn't you just go to the USPS store and buy a bunch of flat rate boxes/envelopes? Or is an ID required to do as such? I'm about to become a vendor myself and that was the route I was thinking of going but I haven't tested it yet.

    This is probably the best way to go. You can walk in to pretty much any post office and they usually have several sizes of flat rate boxes/envelopes out somewhere to take, you don't have to pay for them until you actually ship the box, at which time you pay with cash. You can't order shipping with a pre-paid or gift card online, but you can get flat rate boxes shipped to you (or probably a friend) at no cost... Or at least you could a few years ago when I had them bring me hundreds (over time) so I could make a flatrate box fort.

    USPS flat rate envelopes/boxes are free.  Buy stamps for postage(with cash) and forget about click n/ship(paper trail).  Drop packages in drop box.

    Can you use stamps to add a DCN tag to your parcel?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For instance, I always use 4 stamps on small padded mailers.  According to the USPS website, I would need $2.80 total in postage to add DCN, or 6.22 stamps.  Will they take, process, and send my parcel if I put 6 forever stamps on it?

    Honestly DCN is entirely uneccesary and a security risk (you have to go into the PO with parcel in hand to buy them, I think there is a way to buy them online but then you'd have to use some kind of digital payment.... just not a good idea).. I used to use DCN for legal chems I vended on a now defunct forum. DCN's are generally something new vendors offer to attempt to prove legitimacy, IMO you should all just stick to snail mail. Safer, DCN doesn't offer any more speed and really only serves to comfort a worried buyers mind.

    Tina, the answer to your question is YES.  If you want to add Delivery Confirmation to a First Class or Priority letter/pkg simply add 75 cents worth of postage stamps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS  6 Forever stamps = $2.70 not $2.80 right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way, it's best not to overstep your envelopes. This is one of the many red flags Postal Inspectors have identified in profiling  for contraband.  Next time you buy stamps pick up a variety of denominations not just Forever stamps and use exact amounts.

     You want to get the $100 American Express card...They cost about $105...ou could go to a PO and use the machine there to print "metered" or custom price postage...

    Awesome tip Mr. Shroom. I will try it out, but I am concerned about all the fucking cameras in the PO. What to do about them?

    Not all post offices have cameras, some have them in the lobby, &amp; some just in at the counters.  As far as the mis - information about DCN costs, it is only $.75 additional for priority boxes &amp; envelopes.  But it is $.85 for first class.
