    Never forget how terrible the Royal Mail are this time of year.

    It's going to snow too, so don't count on any packages showing up in december.

    I agree, if you want to get your stuff in time just order before mid November. Royal Mail is a very very good service in my opinion but it's true, a bit of snow and the nation goes in panic, no trains no cabs no deliveries
    <br/>
    I don't understand how they can always be so not ready for snow, UK is not the most warm country in the world, is it?!
    <br/>
    On the other side if you are not in a rush during Christmas there will be a huge amount of parcels and letters to handle so I assume the controls will be less accurate in order to keep up with the deliveries and this can be and advantage for all of us :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But this is just my idea!
