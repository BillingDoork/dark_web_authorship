    Hi everyone ,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    since I'm new at SR I've got some questions regarding the order:
    <br/>
    1. How long would it take to deliver the the package to my place in Germany?
    <br/>
    2. Do I have to pay something extra for the delivery? And how does it even work? I thought, that all packages coming from outside Germany are checked at customs, at least when you have to pick them up there? Or am I wrong, and I will get a home delivery (with no check at customs at all  :o )?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best regards,
    <br/>
    <br/>

    All packs coming from within the EU (look it up if you are not familiar) have open borders. Both people and goods, including mail, move quickly and uncontrolled between borders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However countries do reserve to right to check anything entering their borders if there is a perceived 'threat'. And drugs are an easy threat to convince to a judge. I

    <br/>
    Given the speed of letters within the EU, even from the NL, (2 days normally to other countries with good postal system), I assume not so many letters are checked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So to answer your question. Order from one of the many EU vendors after checking their rep in the forums, and receive your package quickly and with low risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    I assume you are an American studying abroad. Don't be a dick and ship it to the people hosting you.

    Thx for the quick answer... No, I'm not an American, so I 'm aware of the fact that goods can move uncontrolled within borders of the EU (sorry, for the confusion) . However, there are some vendors sending their stuff from Thailand etc (or don't even tell where they are shipping the packages from) ... So I guess, those deliveries would be checked by customs and won't be home delivered directly, right?

    All outside EU mail and shipments go through customs. Particular attention is paid to  high risk countries. Not sure if Thailand qualifies but probably.

    everything is checked by customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The trick and our safety is that letters at customs have such a big amount per day, that if the packaging is right it is a nice ratio to our favor not to get sized from customs.

    If you order inside Germany, the package should be at your place the day after it's shipped.
    <br/>
    Other countrys are always different.
    <br/>
    From NL i've experienced a shipping time from 2 - 5 working days.

    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am in Austria, but I guess there isn't much difference in custom procedures.
    <br/>
    I generally use to order from inside the EU, but I have ordered at least 15 times from the US without problems.
    <br/>
    (weed, hash, LSD, even pills in bottles, but NO weapons or anything else containing metal parts)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And, which really surprised me, I didn't even get a letter from customs to pay duties, something I almost always get when ordering from some US ebay vendor for example.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only country everything I ordered from in the last 10 months or so and had problems with is China.
    <br/>
    Regardless of what I order, completely legal items, faked watches, legal chemicals, drugs, everything is checked for tax reasons at least. But that might be an Austrian specialty, or, more probable, just a personal problem. I have ordered a lot of things from China (before SR existed), mostly at least violating copyrights.
