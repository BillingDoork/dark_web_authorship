    For those from Norway/Australia (and anywhere else with ridiculous Customs)...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have you ever not received a package (or just "heard of" someone not receiving their package)? If so, were there any repercussions?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Feel free to be as vague or specific as you're comfortable with. I'm just curious about what happens after somebody seizes your merchandise...

    In AU if customs seize a smallish order then generally nothing happens, no love letter and no knock at the door. However you can be sure that seizure gets logged on a system somewhere and if a pattern of seizures is detected or larger amounts get picked up then I'm sure bad things might happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been quite sure up until recently that the AU customs things gets hyped up way too much however I'm now starting to hear from quite a few people who are not receiving their stuff, either way the debate will rumble on and speculations made. All I will say is if you get a no show consider that address burned.

    Yes
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No immediate repercussions, however LE would be silly not to be recording it somehow you'd think.

    Yes, like 1/3rd of all packages I ordered to Norway never showed up. Many from big popular vendors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Few years ago a friend mailed 1-2gram of weed in badly packed letters to 2 different addresses in Norway from NL, both were stopped and there was letter from customs AND a police interrogation for both.
    <br/>
    So Im pretty sure that when similar amount of meth or heroin get stopped, surely there should be a response from authorities aswell, especcialy when it happens repeatedly. Even a few tabs of LSD (supposedly well hidden) 'disappeared'.
    <br/>
    The address where all these letters disappeared there has been many successful orders since. So I'd think it seems unlikely they were indeed stopped, and doesn't seem the address was flagged either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Altho big popular vendors, I think it's selective scamming or something....

    some good food for thought here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my friend in Aus had 10 pills go missing a few weeks ago. i have no idea what level of interest Customs/LE would have in that? seems pretty low-level to me, but you never know i guess.

    they would not give a shit.
    <br/>
    i would be certain the address is on a 'list' somewhere. but they would care more about the oz's coming in through the mail than following up on that.
    <br/>
    should your mate continue to order to that address, there is nothing stopping customs or AFP from passing the info onto the local plod in his area.. they have time to chase this shit up.. if they are of course not out getting speeding drivers ::)
