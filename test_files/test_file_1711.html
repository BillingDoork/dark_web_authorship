    I have a few questions about France....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Firstly, why do there seem to be no French vendors whatsoever?  Seen Italy, Spain, various Eastern European countries, and obviously Germany and the Netherlands represented.  But no-one from France.    I thought perhaps it was a drug law thing, but don't think they are that harsh.  Then it occurred to me that I've seen no French-speaking vendors at all... Eg Belgian, Swiss.  So perhaps it is something to do with the language---ie the fact that the French are traditionally a lot more reluctant to learn English than most other Europeans?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly, what are the drug laws like anyway?  How do they compare to, say, the UK or Germany?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And finally, for those people who have ordered to France, what is it like receiving there?  What's a typical delivery time from another European country, and are customs very effective?  Would be particularly interested in hearing from anyone who can compare it to ordering from the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Answers or general musings on any of these subjects gladly received.

    there is a drug 0 tolerance in France. If they catch you on a festival with 1 joint the cops will rape you in the bushes.
