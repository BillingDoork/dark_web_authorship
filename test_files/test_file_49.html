    Does anyone here know if a package from Dutchaanbod to a Canadian address requires a signature?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would ask him directly but I can't get onto SR right now.

    I dont think so, Im pretty sure weather or not a signature is needed depends on how the sender ships it, and no reputable vendor will send a package in such a way. Seeing as when LE does a controlled delivery they will try to get you to sighn for it,it would be a good idea not to sign for any package unless that is something you worked out with the sender before hand.

    If I order over 50gs from him (to Canada) what are the cons of requiring a signature? Why is it that people do not want to sign for packages?

    The major con seems to be LE having your signature on a piece of paper accepting the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the package did not require a signature you could retrieve it and immediately write "return to sender" on it and leave it sealed for a day or so. This way if LE came to your door after you accepted the package you would have a package that looks like it was unrecognized by you and being sent back.

    My main concern is related to how the package gets left.  I've had parcels (like shoes) left between the screen door and front door, while some items (like letters) aren't delivered unless you are at home to receive them and instead you have to pick them up at the post office with ID.  I'm not clear how the post office decides which way an item will be delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess what I should have asked in my original post was what will happen if I'm not home.  Will it be left, or will I get a notice to pick it up at the post office.
