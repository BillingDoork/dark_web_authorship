    I had two packages delivered today that were already opened and empty.  Both from different vendors but both are inside the UK.  One was 1g of hash and the other was 10 Viagra (not illegal in the UK).  If the goods were seized, would I have been notified?  I have a feeling the postie has took them for himself.
    <br/>
    I really can't understand how this has happened, how could anyone possibly know the content was worth stealing?
    <br/>
    This is the first time I have ever had anything go missing both from the silk road and other legit packages.
    <br/>
    Anyone able to shed some light on what has happened?
    <br/>
    I'm 100% sure Royal Mail is the thief and not anyone else in my house.

    I have just found another package that got delivered today on the kitchen table,  the two that have been pre-opened were padded jiffy bags.  This one is a plain envelope with a 7g bulge sticking out of it.  How can the most obvious parcel make it to me and the two that are padded jiffy bags not?  Any ideas what has happened?
