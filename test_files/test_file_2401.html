    Was delivered in the middle of it all and in a country that is considered pretty staunch at customs AND took part in the operation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So did your package get through during this time or are you still waiting OR did you get a LL?

    question.. does customs open most mail or just parcel? anyway, I ordered mine on Sept. 15th and wasn't shipped till the 17th so it was in transit during the middle of Pangea.. royal mail did take a bit longer as usual as well.. it came in about 16 days compared to some people getting it as quick as 7-10 days prior to al that..but still glad I got mine! west coast USA

    It had the holes punched into the pack, and was obviously opened and resealed with a different adhesive strip. Not a legit shipment, Cloudsurfer's got the ninja stealth.  ;)

    I barely found out about Pangea yesterday.. can someone please clarify if it's still going on? And is it in every country or just the UK? I've had 2 packages arrive on Sept 20 and Sept 26 to the US ... one from AH... which I almost shat my pants when I opened the package because of not so stealthy it was... and the other package was from Symbiosis..which was inconspicuous.

    Pangea ended on the 2nd October. They actually reported the end of it here in Ireland on the main stream news so pretty sure it is definitely over. It was an operation between 100 countries. A load of balls if you ask me. Long live the road :)

    From what we've come to understand is that OPV ended a few days ago..
    <br/>
    AND.. it was mainly for larder-scale items that could be shook around and you could hear blatant rattling.. stuff like that.

    i have one domestic order for a gram of hash that has taken nearly 3 weeks to arrive. First class in the UK surely cant take that long. I also have a coke order from germany that has almost been 3 weeks but i know the seller was backlogged at the time so i was expecting a delay on that one. im just thinking that if the hash was intercepted then they'll be keeping an eye on the address and maybe the coke will be intercepted too. i hope not!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i have since made another weed order to a different address and that arrived from Belgium to UK in about 4 days.

    Yep, I thought the worst, I logged in and I had 12 hours to finalise,
    <br/>
    the 1/2 G of alpraz. came a few hours later.

    The rest were all domestic orders, I wasn't worried about them too much.

    sorry man that sucks to anyone waiting.... as myself!  I just have a question to anyone who received a pack during or anytime. If it has a hole punched does that mean it was inspected? my friend received a pack and he said it has a hole punched on top an looks resealed? He of course did not open it yet. Just in case. but i would like to know. If it has a hole punched does that mean it was opened? I appreciate any all feedback!
    <br/>
    let me know

    I have received a couple of packages that had holes punched in them. It was always the envelopes with the padding/bubble wrap on the inside of them. My paranoia got the better of me, so one day when I was in a stationary shop, I checked out those kind of envelopes. Some of them actually have holes (the size of hole punchers) in them when they are sold. The hole is up near the top, where you fold it over to seal it closed. Since then, my mind has been at ease :)

    +1 for you my good man! thank you! my friend is going to be able to take off that adult diaper! lol haha, he was really worried and i thought he was fine as well! but anyone else can give feedback still appreciated. because above someone said they had it through customs and could tell was searched and had hole punched.  So that made him worry and he said may have been opened? idk what to tell him. This helps but any  more info greatly appreciated!

    No hassle dude. Of course what I am saying is not gospel, just an observation I made. But, I reckon he will be safe. There is another thread here tonight and DrDeepWood has some insight that contradicts mine. All in all, if the package made it to your friend and the vacuum seal was in tact, i'd bet on it that he is safe ;)

    i did +1 you for that! i do not know why i have so many negative? i mean i go and give the best insight to anyone i can! is there some dick that just goes around giving negatives?lol
    <br/>
    anyway I do not think it is vac sealed? it is supposed to be i think prescription. I mean maybe he should talk to his vendor about vac sealing. Also, he is waiting to open, He is waiting. He wrote return to sender and is letting it sit for a bit. So can i have link to drdeepwood thread? that way i can get another opinion thought i trust your experience. i hope to hear back from you and other SR users.
    <br/>
    Also again i hope everyone waiting Gets good news
    <br/>
    thanks in advance

    Don't worry about the karma thing man! I gave you +1 to even you out anyway ;) You won't know if it is vac sealed until the package is opened.

    <br/>
    Here is a link to that thread I mentioned. DrDeepWoods post is in there somewhere:

    thanks for the +1 appreciate it, and i know this vendor he does not us vac seal. I mean its for caps and what he puts them in would most likely crush them. which would suck. Anyway your advice has helped and so has the vendors. I just hope it makes it here before the weekend I do not want to sit and wait worrying again.
    <br/>
    Even thought worrying is like a rocking chair gives you something to do but gets you no where. lol_van wilder.
    <br/>
    but thanks for karma it just sucks to have negatives when i try to give all the most well thought advice and i do not ask a question without putting in time to research it first!
    <br/>
    but thank you best wishes to all waiting
    <br/>
    later and thanks to all in adcanve for given advice and stating facts it helps the community out!
    <br/>
    thank you
