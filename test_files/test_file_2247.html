    Hi, Guys.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I got a Custom's Notice Seizure letter today. I had a stroke of good luck however, because what I ordered was a handful of pills and some meth. But the seizure notice was for a single pharmaceutical tablet. Thank God. So it wasn't a narcotic seizure and they'll just destroy it. Though I'm a bit annoyed with the vendor for sending me something completely different to what I wanted and costs way less. But that's another story. I should just count my lucky stars.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question is: Is my address now burned? Will they be watching any incoming mail, internationally or/and domestically? I am not going to order internationally, so, don't worry, but I just want to ask. And if it's not safe, how long does it stay that way? Is domestic ok still?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I assume because something got flagged, even though it;s not narcotic, they will keep my address is a database, and any further forfeitures could be used to make a case against me. Or am I over-estimating the Government.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, after I guess, 5/10 packaged made it from overseas, including this siezed one, making my strike rate 50%. But I think, 3 of those that didn't arrive were scammers. So, 5/7. Not bad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice/information for me and the community would be great.
    <br/>

    If I was you I'd remove the item that actually got seized from your post - all we need to know is that a drug/prescription got seized to answer your question. How many packages containing what you posted above in the last month were found? Not many I would think, and there is no doubt in my mind that all seizures are recorded and stored somewhere. Just what I think anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In terms of ordering more packages to that address - no. That address will now be flagged I would think. The N.Z youngsters who got caught importing off SR had a couple packages seized at customs all going to the same address and continued to order, as well as talking freely about it on sms, facebook etc - IDIOTS. Different situation to yourself I know, but same principal. Whether its safe to order from domestic vendors I'm not too sure, personally I wouldn't even order domestic to that address, but I suppose I'm a little more paranoid than others, so I'll let someone else give their input on that one.

    Good luck sir,

    well 30 people already know the specifics, and you repeated the specifics in your request for him to remove the specifics. I promise I won't repeat them again, but remove any reference to what was seized in which country and when. because 29 LE officers already know it, you should try to limit that ASAP.

    Ha! Yes I am an idiot. Trying to give advice and inadvertently gone and done the same thing OP has -_-
    <br/>
    But it's probably too little to late anyway, that info would have already been noted long before I had the chance to bring it to attention.
