    i ordered 3 parcels i was expecting today. my mailbox is located far away from my house because i live on a dirt road, if i had 3 parcels comming that could not fit into the mailbox would they leave me a notice for a delivery confimation, you know the pink slip telling you they couldnt leave it? I did not expect them all to be here today but they very well could have been. Would the mailman leave 3 notices for each parcel?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This has never happend before to me and i would love some opinions b4 i decide to go to the post office to grab them or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kinda stuck on weather there trying to get me to come there or if they really could not have been left =P

    If you get the pink slip you have to pick it up or go to usps.com/redeliver and have them redeliver the package when you are present.  Yes they will leave a pink slip for every package that wasn't delivered.

    My concern comes in at they mailman never goes to the house because of the dirt road, so if they were trying to do a CD would they leave a pink slip instead? Also ive had many successful deliverers and these are pretty low scale. Also if all three parcels would have arrived would i have etc 3 pink slips?

    Try not to think negatively before you have a real reason to. It will keep you from being stressed out and attracting anything negative from happening. (law of attraction). You have a pretty big advantage if you live down a dirt road. Gives you some time before anyone can get to your house. I wish I had a dirt road :/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But really man I'd just wait for the slip. they should throw it in your mailbox. Some mailmen might even drive down the dirt road for a package.

    note i received a pink slip today. Would there be 2 more for the other parcels? and they have never left a slip before and im pretty sure it could fit into the mailbox. Also  the pink slip doesn't say i have to sign for the package there just confirm delivery? is this a risk or just a concerned post office?
    <br/>

    Edit* The person of my drop location said there willing to go so we will see tomorrow!

    I don't have any experience with that my friend so I don't want to give you bad advice, however when you go to the post office and receive the package just wait a while before you open it...maybe even up to a week. Also, you should ask the vendor if they require a signature. That will help you determine whether or not it seems right. Also note that USPS has to have a warrant to open your parcel. So if a postal inspector talks to you and asks you to open the package you can refuse and he has to come back with a warrant so have your house clean and the package gone. FedEx and UPS don't need warrants though so keep that in mind.

    I sincerely doubt any LE is going to stake out a post office for days over a few packages..
    <br/>
    Unless you are talking pounds of products I would not even bat an eyelash. If they wanted to CD you it would already be done.
    <br/>
    Think about how many people order and get multiple packages weekly, I know I do, amazon,walmart, ebay..

    Everything's all good, turned out just fine the parcel actually could not fit into my mailbox but this product could have easily been fit into the smallest box. It actually had bits of leaf in the taping on the box and a small smell i was more concerned about this.

    You need to address this with the vendor. That's bullshit! That could have gotten you a problem. Treat this as though he disrespected you in a huge way! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL OF HIM/HER!

    Yeah im currently in the waiting process of him/her responding to my messages. Not only did it in fact have traceable amounts of shake in the taping but also smelled. This is not the worst part if this vendor only sent me 1 parcel they shorted me 20gs. I do not see why he could not have easily fit in all in this huge box...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    his/her stealth was as followed:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    annoying ass box that was too big and the smallest flat-rate could have accommodated  the whole order,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the gear was in 1 foil bag that reaked when i opened the package not even the foil. they could have easily foodgrade  it then mylar or some shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Worst stealth i have ever had on the road. Also the vendor informed me it was only 1 parcel.
    <br/>
    woo 20gs short for a big risk because of stealth issues
