    I hope I am wrong but listen up:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Different vendors are saying deliveries to Sweden are not arriving since Easter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People have PM'd me about non-deliveries to Sweden.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems to be an EU mail thing, one of my contacts ordered from different EU countries and USA.
    <br/>
    The USA delivery arrived in one week. All the EU ones never arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would advise everyone who has ordered from or to Sweden to do what they have to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lots of love.

    I can confirm that it is not just EU Mail being intercepted.

    If I did not know any better I would say LEO have upped the ante concerning customs in Swe...

    I have noticed a serious failure rate occur in the last 2 months for stuff sent from the EU to Australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am wondering if there is some sort of operation on mail leaving the EU.. point of exit scanning seems to be more efficient than point of entry scanning.

    My highest fail rate is to Sweden also.

    Recently some orders didn't arrive. This sucks both for me and the customer. One order is a 10g coke order, it's difficult to give 100% refunds on everything ... Grrrr stupid Swedish customs..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now back to a ton of orders and 100+ pms.

    In Australia they scan all the packages coming from other countries with x-rays. I've seen it on TV. When I watched that show they just found 10 pills of ecstasy from UK.

    My most educated hypothesis is that the package security is usually inadequate for Swedish customs. Vacuum is NOT a good packaging material\method. Most things that would fit a letter box (small amounts, up to about 30 g weed) have a much higher chance of success than something you have to collect from a post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The conclusion is, depending on what items one wants to order of course, that Swedes should use more domestic vendors than international for the time being. This does not come as the greatest news for many obvious reasons but it is the safest to go. LSD is an example of an item that is more or less always safe to order even internationally.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One will consolidate a major thread concerning Swedish SR related matters, it is time for this.

    I have no idea mate, quoting statistics is meaningless as I have no idea how much actually gets sent here to compare that against the customs annual reported seizure rates.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All I know is most of my shit makes it ok along with many others I talk too, country of origin seems to factor quite strongly in the sucess rate as it goes, I've had a shocker of a run with ordering from the UK recently.

    In total 5 orders from the UK have been intercepted in the last few months, found out the AFP and customs were running an operation after the fact when most of them never made it though. The UK has been my worst source country to order from when on the face of it it should be the easiest.

    Five?? That sucks! So you received letters from customs etc? I ask coz I received a letter recently. Had a long hard think about how to play it. After much research I decided not to respond, but I was borderline. I still reckon I mighta been able to get it back, but I eventually decided it wasn't worth the risk.

    Hope u dont mind me asking but after five intercepts how is it that they haven't gone for a warrant to come visit u?

      In total 5 orders from the UK have been intercepted in the last few months, found out the AFP and customs were running an operation after the fact when most of them never made it though. The UK has been my worst source country to order from when on the face of it it should be the easiest.

     Five?? That sucks! So you received letters from customs etc? I ask coz I received a letter recently. Had a long hard think about how to play it. After much research I decided not to respond, but I was borderline. I still reckon I mighta been able to get it back, but I eventually decided it wasn't worth the risk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hope u dont mind me asking but after five intercepts how is it that they haven't gone for a warrant to come visit u?

    Which sellers have the best packaging when sending to Sweden?
    <br/>
    Is it more important which seller (good packaging) you choose than which country that sellers ships from?

    No way, as the topic suggest there propably was a major operation for a while. All but one order has gone through and the one taken was from a high risk country. My guess is that they had dogs sniffing packages/letters there for a while but it should be fine by now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since 27 days ago I've ordered methadone, subutex, lorezapam and clonezapam all of them has gone through without any problem. But I only order within EU and from countries that I know are somewhat safe.
    <br/>
    Hope it helps

    I'm certain these are used extensively in Australia.
    <br/>
    As long as your vendor seals the product in mylar foil for the final layer (not food grade vac seal!!!) and ensures that it has been washed on every layer, and that it is flat enough/addressed properly to pass auto sorting, it will make it through fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's not much that can be done about x rays but due to mail volume there's no way they can hit a significant percentage of regular mail with them.

    Hi(gh) SR´s,
    <br/>
    I´m sure there´s going on something, in EU at least!
    <br/>
    Even letters from outside (f.i.US) don´t come through!
    <br/>
    I don´t know if that depends on the adress to deliver, or if it depends on the country from which it was sent.
    <br/>
    I tried only NL til now, and they didn´t made it since one month.
    <br/>
    We are maybe not aware of the amount, which is running through mail - it´s for sure a big one!
    <br/>
    And once they have letters from different vendors (maybe ordered by themselfes?) it should be easy to recognize them, at least at the local post-office.
    <br/>
    IT´S IMPORTANT FOR VENDORS TO IMPROVE AND FREQUENTLY CHANGE THEIR PACKING (MBB, ETC),OTHERWISE SR WILL REDUCE AND GET SMALLER AND SMALLER TIL IT´S UNITERESTING FOR CUSTOMERS!
    <br/>
    This is the new (indirect) way for LE to fight against SR, BMR, ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or am I wrong??

    You cannot say this is money waste. I mean VEGETABLES, can you picture yourself the threat that it is ?

    In my country we don't stop vegetables at the border and all I can say is that we suffer. Our economy is bad, there is a lot of crime, happiness is gone, the weather sucks, our TV channels too.

    I think it is because of all these fucking vegetables we let in. This is not right. We should spend TONS of money and time blocking theses bastards at the border, there is choise.

    <br/>
    Now think again next time you want to say that stopping vegetables at the border is absurd. It is always sunny in Australia, and this is one among thousands of other evidence that employing half of the country to screen every letter or scrotum trying to cross the border for these goddamn vegetables is useful and not waste as you, disrepectfully for every Australian citizen tax payer, said.

    While I doubt that is the real reason to a certain degree Sweden is not in a position to credibly claim the same reasons. If one crosses the borders from Sweden into Denmark there's not going to be any checkpoints whatsoever, but try and take a boat or cross the bridge into Sweden and you'll see Customs all over the place. This creates a situation where it's more common with drugs from Denmark than the Netherlands (a technicality since most of the drugs in Denmark come from the Netherlands) since even though they try and control the inflow at the borders there's simply too much traffic. Post arriving from the Netherlands is most of the time heavily profiled at Customs and it seems to be basically Russian Roulette if they single a package out or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recently saw a thread called Program about Silkroad and Danish customs: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=177095.msg1278235 which had a link which showed a bit how Danish Customs operate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu3g5EUN-ck
    <br/>
    If we're talking efficiency in stopping drugs this is a total joke in comparison to Sweden which would probably open up 10-50% of those big post carts, rip open letters at random etc.

    A forum member who hasn't reached their 50 posts yet has asked me to post this here:

    It seems every paper in Sweden published the same tiny article two days ago, saying that as part of a "big international operation", Swedish customs had seized 15,000 pills. Below are links to the original article and its Google Translate version, here posted slightly edited (Google says Swedish "prescription drugs" are all "narcotics" :o ):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Customs has prevented the importation of about 15,000 tablets, capsules and vials of mainly prescription drugs into Sweden, in a major international operation against illicit prescription . The seizure consisted mostly of controlled substance pharmaceuticals, sexual enhancement drugs, and diet pills. Large shipments of what appears to be the prescription drug Tramadol has been seized at Stockholm Arlanda airport and the postal terminal in Toftanäs, Malmö. The [Medical Products Agency] will now analyze the seized drugs."

    Tramadol HCl is popular in Sweden. Doctors love prescribing this total annihilator of all pain, for anything from a period to a broken neck. People get a taste for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to a large paper, this was part of operation "Pangea VI." More than a hundred countries were involved during June 18-24 in an effort against both import and sales. Allegedly 58 people were arrested—in total 9.8 million pills seized, valued at around $40 million. Among the most common shipping countries (actually detected) are UK, Thailand, and Spain. (The latter two have always liked it up top, UK more so lately.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've also heard whispers about the Tramadol capsules in the article photo being sold by at least one of the domestic sellers.

    Side-note for those ordering from the US or Australia: other whispers say this ring is huge with ties out to SR (and Canada).
