    Hey all, I'm new to SR and bought some LSD and MDMA for a (very memorable) trip to Yellowstone. I ordered both items on the 2nd after a steep learning curve for PGP and BitC. One coming from NL and the other from Czech Repub and both are going to USA. It has now been over 3 weeks, both are in resolution with one closing in 16 hours (vendor didn't accept resolution or read my messages) the other has been extended another 7 days. Both vendors are 4.9 or 5.0 with over 6mo vendor status. I read up on CDs but that would have happened by now I'm sure. So what's the deal, am I getting scammed by two different vendors or did Customs forget to mail me my notification of seizure? I'm worried I'll be losing a lot of money on my first two orders and get stiffed the 2.2 bitcoins I paid because I'm not an established customer yet.

    International can take up to a month.  Are you the only one with access to your mailbox?  PM me about the Czech order.  I think I have experience with the guy you're talking about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also you can order 25i (pretty cheap) and LSD (less cheap) domestic and maybe get it in time for your trip.  They're not the same but 25i is a functional substitute for me.

    To be honest bro it sounds more like the vendors not shippiing your stuff really. Its just the feeling i got. I could be wrong, but iv been buying well over a year and im coming up on 100 purchases, iv had stuff from almost every part of the world. I will admit Netherlands from what i hear is more of a flagged country and mail from their i hear is a little more looked at. But iv had about 4 orders from NL for H,X AND a other things, and i always got my stuff within a week . It was surprisingly fast. Please dont tell me you FE? never do it bro!! NEVER! THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER VENDOR WILLING TO SELL TO YOU. I never FE one time out of my buys unless i wanted to for a couple of very trusted guys i bought from allot..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also Lsd bro? God it would be so hard to find and detect, unless youv ordered sheets and sheets of it. Iv had LSD and Blue Ghost X pills sent from France not a issue. Iv had Opium from face, Home made lodinum from there, Benzos;s from Poland, Oc's from AUS, MORE BENZOS FROM LONDON AND PHILIPPIANS INCLUDING FAKE OR SHALL I SAY COPY OC'S, THEY HAD PAIN MEDS BUT WERE NOT THE ORIGINAL OC OXICONTIN USA ONCE HAD..Asia,canada etc etc.. never had a seizure and never got a love letter...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv been lucky, but i also make sure i do my research on my vendors, there is nothing wrong with working with a new vendor of 6 months, but when u r new yourself, u need to go to a veteran ,who knows to stealth package and seal products proper.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if by small chance these 2 orders have been seized , i will tell you they do not always senda love letter u just lose shit.. iv known it to happen to a good friend here on SR and he is a older man and not a lier, and it has happen to him..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now for the guy not wanting to come to a agreement about the shipping issue, and at least giving u 50% back, unless he has it writting in his vendor profile, then that shows u what kinda person your working with..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv watched allot of new vendors come and just start really fucking newer ppl over or anyone they could. Your duty as a SR TRAVLER IS any issue u come across that is not on the level with a vendor is to come to these forums and let the rest of the sr buyers know, so u can save someone from being fucked aROUND LIKE YOU SEEM TO BE..  That is the way all us over 1 year on sr travlers use to handle things, these days it just seems like vendors are getting away with whatever and buyers are not saying nothing cause the POS vendors are blackmailing them or worried about being on a banned list.. DONT WORRY ABOUT THIS BS BANNED LIST SOME OF THESE LOOSER VENDORS SPEAK OF, IT IS A SCARE TACIC, NOTHING HERE CAN STOP YOU FROM BUYING.. UNLESS YOUR BUYER STATS R TRULY SHITTY AND YOUR A SCAMMER AS A BUYER..WHICH ALSO HAPPENS ITS NOT JUST THE VENDORS..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    yOU younger Generation need to UNITE and make it a common well known automatic thing, if u get fucked around bring the news to the threads, put the vendor on blast. Thats the way we use to handle things and 9xout of 10 we kept most shit under control, their will always bee the guy who scams, but at one time we kept it to a small % cause vendors knew people like me,, did not give a fuk if your service and product was bad or your communication i reviewed every buy i would make and come to the forums and grade each subject starting from
    <br/>
    <br/>
    vendor communication
    <br/>
    shipping,from start to finish
    <br/>
    stealth
    <br/>
    product
    <br/>
    <br/>
    etc you guys get the picture.. thats the way it needs to be re started..Venodrs knew if they pulled a fast one it was only gonna be a lucky time or 2 cause everyone knew COME TO THE FORUMS AND RESEARCH THE VENDOR, ALWAYS...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im always around if any of you newer guys need any advice, im glade to give it, i hate to see someone be scammed. Like i said i cant give u a 98% guarantee if you truly read the vendors profiles, go to the forums and spend 30 min looking and reading up about them, an going thorough their reviews it will help keep u from getting fuked.. I know u guys just see these great drugs, and u have the bitcoins then u see all this writing on a vendor page, and most r lke "fuck that i just wanna order" well trust me it pays to read their profile, it pays to do yourhome work, or ask around.. Im proof , again close to 100 purchases and never lost an item or been scammed.. Iv only been to resolution one time, and i extended the vendor 7 days she sent me instead of 3 stamp bags of heroin i got 10 bags altogether..  So always try to reach out to the vendor before resolution. Most good vendors wanna make u happy and make things rite instead of going through the BS of reso..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope some of my SR knowledge will help.. If not i tried.. 8)
