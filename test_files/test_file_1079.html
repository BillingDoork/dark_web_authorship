    The guy who takes delivery of my gear was arrested this week and has been charged with importation of class b drugs. There's no proof he had anything to do with it he hasn't a computer or anything. Is there anything to worry about or is there nothing they can do?

    Been nearly a month now and all of a sudden my mate has gone very nasty about the whole thing. Has said he will land me in it if they are able to do him. Is there really anything cops can do about it seen as they anyone can post anything to anyone. He was charged the day he was arrested but there has been no word from the cops since. I'm hoping its a sign they've nothing on him. Advice needed thanks

    can you be 100% sure that your friend is not hiding some information about this case from you? I mean why should he get pissed about this situation a whole month after the package was seized? sounds like maybe police have something on him and he is not telling you
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and what is more, police intercepted 250g of weed and after 1-2 days of jail he got out and thats it? i mean 250g of weed is pretty much, would police really give up that fast? what did police tell him when he got out of jail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If i were you than i would get a clean house (i think i dont have to tell you that  ;)), and then just wait...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i am just curious about this case, would be great if you could keep us up to date!  ;)

    I hope that you realize that La Fuente doesn't send 250 gram packages.  He sends 250 gram orders in two seperate 125 gram packages.  That means the police seized a 125 gram package and arrested him while another 125 gram package was on the way.  I'm just letting you know that...

    if your friend is going sour then you go sour, fuck him.
    <br/>
    he agreed to get it mailed to him, he knew the consequences.. and so do YOU.
    <br/>
    NOW... here comes your conscious ticking...
    <br/>
    do you let him get raped.. or do you get raped?
    <br/>
    or does NO ONE get raped..?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hmm.. decisions decisions.. i would choose the latter honestly.. but,
    <br/>
    not everyone is as smart as me.. or you, maybe..?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    clean house, clean his house, and your friend should've been up to date on what to do...
    <br/>
    if maybe a CONTROLLED DELIVERY was happening...
    <br/>
    but i am sure you didn't tell him any or all of this/that because it's not your drop.. so no harm no foul, right?
    <br/>
    wrong.. your friend is looking at 20+ years in Federal Prison if you let him die for this.. so get to doing some soul searching, bruh.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    clean house, clean his house. get lawyers... get him out... relax.
    <br/>
    if he is going sour, then you go sour. like i said...
    <br/>
    if he goes to say it is yours.. i would just be like "why would i get mail from Mexico to his house??? weird no?"
    <br/>
    no phone records, texts, mails, or anything else.. you're good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    talk to him.. tell him to shut his cock sucker and jump through the beautiful loop holes of the "justice system".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck.. keep us updated.

    If he was never on the forums and you were, you shouldve informed (trained) him. The first thing everyone learns on SR is to DEN DENY DENY in a 'code red' scenario such as this. Never say anything without counsel present, dont let them scare you with the idea of more charges if you dont talk. If you already know this then make sure he does. There are attorneys on the forums who always tell you to keep your mouth shut with LEO. Drill this into your friends head. Always deny, they have to prove your guilt to not make it easier for them by saying you had prior knowledge of a crime being committed, seek legal counsel (i am not a lawyer) and DO NOT TALK.

    Noone thinks theyre gonna get busted until they do, now it time to make us all proud and play it out right. Good luck brother!

    LE does this a lot. Not to burst your bubble, but something is coming, unless you made some sort of deal. I take it from your posts that he has not been charged yet? They may believe (given the amount) that you are a part of an organization of some sort that does this regularly, i.e. they are likely watching you. So if you have received anything since, if you have discussed drugs/narcotics/murder/j-walking over text/call/voicemail, if you have done local deals, you'd better stop immediately. Throw out the drugs for a year, then get back to whatever it is you do (that's IF nothing happens in the mean time). If you are doing anything right now, it's just another thing for LE to charge you with, on top of what they have on you (which may be the plan). I would tread carefully; half a pound is no laughing matter.

    You say that there were 2 parcels in the police station in front of him - this is likely the point on which the entire case will hinge. As was mentioned earlier in this thread, the 250g order was split into 2 x 125g packages. The police intercepted the first package and likely started watching your friend's mail to ascertain whether or not this was part of a larger operation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When the second package turned up to the same address they could safely presume that the first package was not sent to that address by mistake, thus feeling that they could proceed with arresting, questioning and immediately charging your friend with a certain offense. The charge is most likely conspiracy to traffick a controlled substance with the intent of sale and supply, or similar.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As he has already been charged that means that the police feel they have enough evidence to secure a conviction against him; you *cannot* be charged with an offense without evidence that an offense has been committed, and you *will not* [usually] be charged with an offense unless that evidence is strong enough to give the police reason to believe that they will win the case when it comes before the court. If they didn't think they could win the case they would have performed a controlled delivery and charged your friend with possession of a controlled substance and intent of sale and supply of same.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically what that means is that your friend is sitting between a rock and a hard place; unless a lawyer can successfully argue that your friend had no knowledge of the packages in question, nor what they contained, it is quite likely that they will be convicted on a conspiracy charge.
    <br/>

    A conspiracy charge where two packages have been seized going to the same address on different dates is going to be much harder for a lawyer to defend against than a conspiracy charge where only one package has been seized going to an address. This is due to the inference produced by the fact that it is highly unlikely that a high value package would be mistakenly sent to the wrong address on two separate occasions.

    In this scenario LE intercepted a package and thus got the second package from waiting on his address. My concern is what if LE intercepts a package and allows it to go through with all it's contents to build a stronger case in the future? Does that happen?

    They intercepted the first package of over a QUARTER POUND FROM MEXICO and they also intercepted the SECOND package of 125 GRAMS FROM MEXICO that came a few days later.  It's not like they had to watch his address at all.  They intercepted the first one no problem...  The second one could have got intercepted for the same reasons as the first one...

    You're right man. I'm just wondering if LE ever intercepts packages and lets the contents go through and build a case on someone? Basically what I'm trying to ask is:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can LE set you up by tricking you that you safely received a package and then wait on your address for another shipment?
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Honestly, if your friend didn't fuck up in any way by talking, he should be fine.

    If his house was clean, then two packages sent to him that he never opened doesn't mean shit.

    I've been waiting on a couple packages from La Fuente for a while. Just got tracking numbers from him, which show that they arrived at a Mexican airport on like the 15th and 28th of May (the idea was he'd send one and see if it arrived then send the 2nd but for some reason he sent both, oh well). I haven't got either of them but I've not had a letter from customs telling me it's been intercepted either. Anyone have any idea what might be going on?

    Damn, with all the weed on the road, you decided to buy bulk from MEXICO?   To me that does not sound like a good idea at all.  I am guessing that it was a great deal and therefore you couldn't resist?

    La Fuente has crazy low prices anyway, and this was a 2 for 1 offer. Yep, couldn't resist and at the time he had reasonably good feedback.

    Wow... well as libertas said, It wasn't just one package showing up and then your friend having to deny it, It is 2 packages from mexico, So its not as if he can say "someone is out to get me", you could probably count the people he knows in mexico on one hand, If that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As people have already said lawyer his ass up, However! If he is going to flip on you, think about it do you really want to get him a top class lawyer that will advise him to rat on you to save himself 20 years. I think your friend might, I take it your under 30, Look how much you have done in the last 20 years, Would you want to spend that much time inside a jail? Your friend could say it was all him he asked me to do it, pressured me who knows, and he ordered it from silk road, police will say Ahh, High profile bust, great!.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for somebody saying something about a $100 mule, Do you want to trust a mule with such a large package for $100, I reckon he'd be off with your money and the package, If he got caught? You think he would do "x" amount of years for $100, Never.you would get snitched on so fast you would not know what hit you, If you did it anonymously, Again, they would be off with your package.

    As someone said earlier, it could easily just be his neighbour being a dick and ordering weed from Mexico to his address. Unlikely of course but unless they can prove otherwise...

    Yeah,But i woulden't count on his lawyer being able to prove that. I reckon a prosecutor would have no problem convincing a judge or jury that this was either him or hi friend that ordered it.
    <br/>
    Put it this way.
    <br/>
    There were two packages, sent to the same address, (it also depends on what kind of people he is "known" to assosicate with". ) Either he is involved in some serious business, And someone seriously had a contact in mexico, Who spent all that money to get the packages sent, And then arranged for them to be not so securely packaged that they would be caught, but secure enough that they would look like a botched smuggling job. Sound likely? No. And even if his lawyer managed to convince them that this "COULD" have happened, provding some reasonable doubt, It then gives the prosecution a sort of high ball, As all they need to do then to cast doubt on it and make him out to be an unsavoury character would be to say "well has this happened to you? Or even anyone you know? No, So either the defendant is lying or he is telling the truth, But is involved with some serious criminals with international smuggling contacts , cartels most likely in mexico And they are now trying to set him up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could be a dodgy case either way, a good prosecutor could probably get a conviction no matter what he says, If i was his lawyer i would wait to see how they play it, and then go on the defensive from them, Dont give them any story so that they can work around it, let them do the talking, cast reasonble doubt on it and then when they bring it around to counter, Say that the DA is clearly trying to win any way they can and that their original story has now changed twice... It may go in your favour.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Who knows, Good luck mate

    Just deny it.  He will not get in any less trouble if you say, "Hey, I ordered and he was supposed to just get it for me".  I assume he didn't open it and that would sound legit.  Problem is, he would probably get into more trouble, possible conspiracy/trafficking and who knows what else.  You cant get a lawyer for each of you.  You buy a lawyer for him and that lawyer has no allegiance to  you.  He is required by law and his state to work exclusively for his client.  Now, had you both been arrested, charged with the same crime and tried together, then one lawyer will do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know how this works...Trust me.  You buy him a lawyer, he will advise him to roll on you.   Based on his statements and the fact that he doesn't have a warrant may give a judge cause to sign a warrant for your place.  Clean house until it blows over and let him get a public defender.  Coming forward to "claim responsibility" will not help you for sure, and it will hurt him because you are, in effect, acting as a witness against him.  You tell the truth and god only knows what additional charges you both could face.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am not an attorney but I am very educated, been arrested 3 times, 5 felony sales, 3 weed, 2 schedule II, felony evading arrest and a DUI.  With the help of a good lawyer, the lead detective went to the state pen as well, and some research on my part, they dropped all charges.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If he didn't open the package or admit to anything, then they have nothing, especially if they can't get him to "crack".  An attorney, well a lot of them, will tell him to roll on you.   And we all know what happens to snitches.

    Do not tolerate a rat. He knew what he was getting into and has no right to be turning you in. A rat is a person who takes away your good life and puts you in a cage, you have every right to defend yourself from that.

    It's quite the opposite.  Orders slow down when BTC value declines sharply.  I suspect that they hold their bitcoins for when value goes back up.

    The first one is because I pointed out that he has four pages of FEs that have not arrived and one of the cheapest FE deals on 100 grams of MDMA.  After he got upset I deleted the post in good faith and voiced my concerns with him privately through PM.  He edited the post after that.  I actually hadn't seen that thread until today. :P

    The second id just a troll.  Look through his post history. ;D

        May sound like a daft question, but arent more people likely to order when BTC value declines? And arent proucts priced the same anyway?

       It's quite the opposite.  Orders slow down when BTC value declines sharply.  I suspect that they hold their bitcoins for when value goes back up.

     The first one is because I pointed out that he has four pages of FEs that have not arrived and one of the cheapest FE deals on 100 grams of MDMA.  After he got upset I deleted the post in good faith and voiced my concerns with him privately through PM.  He edited the post after that.  I actually hadn't seen that thread until today. :P

     The second id just a troll.  Look through his post history. ;D
     <br/>

     Basically, what I'm saying is that neither of those threads affect me in the least. 8)
