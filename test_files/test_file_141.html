    I heard that when shipping lsd it loses a lot of it's quality because of heat and what not, is this going to happen still if i order domestic? Or does it make no difference? OR is it just a myth... It's a personal amount also.

    Depends a lot on the post.  Light heat and moisture are what cause LSD to degrade.  Light and moisture can be avoided by vac-sealing in a light-proof bag.  So it comes down to heat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously, the less time in transit, the less time that your goods will be exposed to heat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, in my experience, it has taken a hell of a lot of heat over a hell of a long period of time to really degrade my blotters.  I had left blotters in my car during the summer (95-100 degrees each day) for about five days, and when I took those tabs, I didn't notice any degradation.  If I had to guess, I would estimate that they could have spent a month in that car and been only slightly degraded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't worry, but if you must, try to purchase domestic if degradation is your concern.

    I have—alternatively, left some blotters in my car over 1 day and they were basically dead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also got L in the mail this summer when the mailbox (and probably mail vehicle) were 100˚ F, and lost all of it to the heat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Moral of the story for me, is to order in winter and not in summer for that.
