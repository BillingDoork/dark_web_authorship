    Um, 4 days is like a pretty good time for a package to get through clearance. I've seen it easily take 2 weeks multiple times.. especially this time of the year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I highly doubt it was seized. Seriously.

    Customs is really inconsistent, sometimes it goes through almost right away and sometimes it takes weeks. I would just wait a couple days and see if it shows up.

    I would like to speak to the two that vote "yes" on the poll and explain your reasoning please. The overwhelming majority of the time people here fear the worst is when an absolutely normal action (such as the "MISSENT" scans) occur. Learn the system in which your mail operates so you can then truly realize when something abnormal has happened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thinking it was seized for 4 days in customs? Come on.

    Glad you received your mail, OP. Enjoy that Canadian maple syrup. I hear its premium stuff.
