    Just wondering if there are any UK buyers out there experiencing delays in their deliveries? I ordered a few packages first class and none of them have arrived yet.Â  :-\
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone having similar issues maybe due to the Olympics?.. hoping its royal mail being shitty...

    Yeh I have a couple of packages not arrived yet, however packages ordered later have arrived so there is definitely some backlog somewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How long have you been waiting? Think only one left for me is something that should have come Friday/Saturday but is still to show up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Been in touch with vendors and they seemed to know of a couple of reported delays so don't think it is all too uncommon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only strange thing for me is how something that is posted later arrives earlier....?! Surely RM should sort out backlog then get round to delivering new shit....but then that is RM for you!

    Yea its a bit strange, guess they do have some sort of backlog. I've been waiting about a week now, I'm asking because 99% of the time first class comes within less than 2 days so I thought maybe something was up. Ill give it a while before I lose all hope lol. Cheers man.

    Been fine for me guys. Think I'll be getting a package from US soon so I hope that'll go through fine, according to BBC drug traffickers are being waived through.

    Can confirm that there is a delay shipping into the UK at the moment, and very likely to be due to the Olympics.

    Both the U.K and Australia are having issues at the moment. The former because of the Olympics and the security being stepped up because of it and the latter because of a general step up in security specifically targeting the mail system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't be surprised if you get delays or no shows.
