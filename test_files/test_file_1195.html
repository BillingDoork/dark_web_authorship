    I need some help here from someone who has some postal knowledge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am interested in buying some pot and having it shipped to my home. Before I do so, I want to make sure that I am as cautious as possible. My roommate who lives in my house has the required legal documents to purchase and accept delivery of firearm and firearm components to my house. Does this mean that packages to my address are under additional (more than regular) scrutiny? I have been unable to find any information in reference to this from past posts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally have no illegal background activity on my record. Please respond with your thoughts, examples, or facts. Thanks!
    <br/>

    EDIT: i live in the US

    Considering your federal laws on a bit of pot, I would say get an address separate from one that accepts controlled product be it by criminal law, ATF related, or otherwise. You asked the question, so you're already concerned. It's not based on any facts or experience, but at any time media concern activates controversial gun control discussion, in inevitably gets addressed by all areas of society, especially those who are directly affected: your gun control and abolition advocates, and your advocates of your constitutional right to bear arms.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shootings of innocent victims in recent tragedies are not forgotten by these two opposing forces, and both take steps to firmly plant their beliefs and keep what regulations on gun control monitored, so as to prove regulations are followed - the interest of upholders of the constitution. And those who want abolition of gun ownership all together will take what they can get and what's in reach - tougher enforcement of regulations. So two opposing idealistic advocacy groups would (in my logical - but Canadian and therefore less informed - for better or worse due to media mislead) have the exact same immediate interest. This ironic consequence is due to the gun advocates need to prove regulation is working - with good intention. The opposing force favours this as it is the only available way to crack down on diversion of firearms to criminals is to scrutinize the lack of enforcement in hope to get reason for Congress to propose a bill with more regulatory control.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Incidents that may be forgotten or seem far in the past are still fresh to the two aforementioned groups with billion dollar interests in having their way. Government proceedings are lengthy and take a long time to see action. And with 100's of millions poured into relentless lobbying on either side, a change in enforcement can occur at any time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recommend playing it safe and buying a mailbox or convincing a friend to accept it for someÂ  free stuff, explaining how no money trail leads to him and your address is possibly scrutinized due to unpredictable changes in firearm regulatory enforcement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that helps!

    As others have already said, a different address is the SAFEST thing to do. That being said, I also think that there is a huge amt. of paperwork and registering that goes in on the sending end of firearm transactions and as such I'd assume that there is no additional screening applied to ALL of the mail arriving at your door. This is just a guess, as I'd assume most answers here are at this point, so obviously only do what makes you feel comfortable. Wouldn't be a horrible idea to get a P.O. Box unless you plan on receiving larger pot shipments.

    I used to live with a gun shop owner, but never felt any more or less heat from the post office or cops in general. UPS usually delivered the stuff and it was as easy as, picking up a package for say, a new flat screen TV, just 2-3 more papers to sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My gut feeling on this though, is that I wouldn't be doing SR and weapon shipments to the same address. If your friend owns any class 3 firearms/accessories, the ATF can legally come by at any time and audit him, and you having drugs in the house will be bad for the both of you. If your friend is a FFL dealer, well, now he's a felon and out of a job for life. Get another address man.
