    ive tried searching around for answers to this but didnt find a definitive answer, so i ask you guys.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was pondering the issue of vacuum sealing marijuana for shipment.  which as you know has the unfortunate side effect of compressing the product.  Of course it doesnt affect the smoke/buzz.  but theres a very many out there that are very picky about the appearance itself, but you know how that is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can you say put the bagged MJ into a small shipping box THEN triple vacuum seal the box itself rather than a pliable bag thatll compress? (of course this V-Sealed box would be inside a separate shipping box and/or envelope)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wasnt sure if something like that results in a true vacuum seal considering the machine isnt pulling out all the air into a tight fit around your stuff. Does non commercial vacuum sealing machines have the power to properly seal something it cant pull tight against? in that void within the box, is it truly devoid of air and a true vacuum?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any tips would be appreciated, thanks

    I can't definitively answer, but if you're smoking marijuana, and are thinking that far out of the box then you're on the right track and I'm sure you'll do fine. I've seen vendors wrap the bud in paper towels, then seal before. I'm sure if you found a suitable small container you could in theory, vacuum seal it just fine. An altoids tin comes to mind though.

    just seal it wit a lil air in it so it keeps it un crushed. that or like a small carboard frame about 1 in half that way it still fits in priority box
    <br/>
    <br/>
    u can use mylar bags also so it keeps it shape. usually a ziploc bag first then the seal over it

    iv'e read a few post on here saying that the van sealed bags are actually air tight for a certain amount of time before the smell goes through the bag, the more vac seals you use the longer it takes for the smell to get out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there was a post here somewhere where a guy had access to sniffer dogs and did certain tests to find out how long certain drugs take for dogs to sniff, obviously marijuana let out the smell quickest and by memory coke stayed hidden longer.
    <br/>
    i would recommend finding this post. it was something to do with someone owning a kennel where sniffer dogs were kept for some reason.

    I had also considered using rigid/semi rigid inserts like pieces of cardboard etc to limit the compression during sealing. but i was also considering a higher level of stealth in my thought process. Shape/x-ray etc. you know, stuff like rough transit, dropped/damaged box/envelope. i know in most cases a triple vacuum seal is often enough to ensure devliery (in terms of anti odor) but i plan to offer a shipping method with high level stealth

    thanks for the quick replies so far

    interesting read. havent finished yet - but looks pretty educational.  and while i certainly understand that basic premiss that everything is pretty much permeable by air eventually. what role exactly does vacuum sealing have? if something is sealed in a true vacuum, which i guess a vacuum seal using plastics will never be a true vacuum seal or hold one. does that mean as a basic principle, the less air within the bag the less chance for the smell itself to push through the bag and thus become detectable via dog?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    id still like to get a few more opinions on whether you can actually vacuum seal product within a small nox, or if the bag needs to be pulled tight

    I know for certain that one of the primary methods of looking for drugs/explosives etc in mail is random dog sweeps of mail.  i think they will sometimes also do random xray - but assuming im correct, i think most xray is only done AFTER a package is deemed to be suspicious. which could be due to smell of a dryer sheet/coffee grounds etc being extremely obvious tactics used to try and mask other smells. or for whatever reason, maybe the package itself was out of place somehow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would say you packaging being as normal and legit as possible while blending in with all the other mail, followed closely behind by dealing with the scents adnd anti drug dog measures are the primary lines of defense against having your stuff intercepted.  most vendors do not take anti xray precautions.
