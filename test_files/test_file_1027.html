    Was this any good? I saw the advert for it with them kicking and throwing the packages around.

    It had a certain charm.  The kicking parcels was supposedly only one depot and of course they upped the emo by showing the people whose parcels were damaged the tape of them being damaged..  then they moved onto the outsourcing of the royal mail and the lack of security, mail dumping by the staff and the generally crappiness it will bring.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems that with the new outsourced model you will only receive mail every second day, doesn't matter what type of stamp is on it and if the postie is late on the round then they're told to come back to the office rather than deliver the mail as the outsourcer doesn't want to pay overtime.  This has implications for us mere mortals who rather like being able to order in the afternoon and have it in the letterbox the next morning, from now on it looks like it will be delivered when they can bring themselves to bother.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was a shallow look but it's worth checking out.
