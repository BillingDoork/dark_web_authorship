    I think a lot can depend on what state you are in, it has been nearly a year since I had a letter from the UK arrive in less than 7 days, most seem to take around 13 to 15 now and much longer is also not that uncommon. Bottom line is there is no standard anymore, anywhere from a week to a month basically.

    I agree.
    <br/>
    I have been doing quite a bit of reserach on it because I am a new vendor and shipping packages to the states I want to make sure everything arrives A ok.
    <br/>
    Everything I have learned, Via talking to post office workers, Checking online forums, The official mail sites, And talking to people I know who ship abroad regularly for legit reasons points to the same conclusion, There is no definitive timeline anymore. I hope my buyers all understand this as well, as a new vendor you have to put in the extra effort to make sure you are respected.
