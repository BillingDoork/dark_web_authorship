    Thoughts on security?  Reliability?  I would think that it would make a CD difficult to carry out, and prbably adds a level of deniability in case you get caught?

    PO boxes require you give the post office two forms of ID to open one up. They will take down your address in the process. So if a package were to get intercepted. You would be fucked regardless....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMO PO boxes are a waste unless you have special circumstance's such as....you live with your parents or untrustworthy roommates that could possibly open up your package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using fake ID's wouldn't help also because say you go in to pick up a package and you're about to be set up for a CD (Yes you can have a CD in a PO Box - Post office will send you a note)....You'll not only get charged for the dope. You'll get charged for fraud for using the fakes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think that covers everything... :O

    24/7 PO box opened with a fake ID is as safe as it gets imo. Someone mentioned a virtual office is safer but I have no way of knowing that.

    Yeah, Delta, thats what I meant.  A place where you could go in the dead middle of the night, scope it out, conceal yourself, and not give them any real idea of who you are.  There are 4 USPS offices with PO boxes within 15 miles that are 24/7.  Seems like the only way LE could get you is if you get caught bad on CCTV, or if they do a 24/7 CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would take, at worst, a few more resource, and at best, many more resources on their part to catch you, no?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BuddhaNature, why would a vendor specifically not ship to a PO Box?  I can imagine not shipping to multiple addresses at the same PO, but, blanket PO Boxes everywhere?  My SR mentor has received 66 transactions to a single PO Box with only one issue--probably the fault of the vendor.  Are you saying vendors should insist that he use his real address?  Seems sketchy...

    I personally Stopped shipping to PO Boxes. As a Vendor I havnt had any issues but 2. Bth of those were to PO Boxes. Even with a printed label It just raises a Flag as far as USPS is concerned.
    <br/>
    I will look at case by case basis such as a Rural location or Farm Road. Otherwise, it's a hassle as far as I'm concerned.

    Afraid of their packages not fitting and customers refusing to pick it up at the front desk. I've seen it happen quite a few times.
    <br/>
    [Edit] Before someone beats me to it with "But my PO leaves a key to a bigger box for larger packages",  This is not the case with every Post Office.
