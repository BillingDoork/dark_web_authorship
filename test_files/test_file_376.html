    I ordered 2 items off 1stopoz last Tuesday, the status was updated to in transit Thursday, and today is Monday and I still have no mail? Could it have gotten seized maybe?

    Same here. Ordered on Tuesday. Updated to in transit on Thursday afternoon. Its now Thursday one week later and Im still watching the mailbox. Sent 1stopoz an email yesterday but he is yet to read it. Clearly this vendor has a great reputation so I have high hopes and am keeping fingers crossed, I give him lots of credit for what he does. In a weird way its kinda relieving that someone else has had the same experience. @bohdanhedges, did you get it in the end or what?

    Highly unlikely, did you order express with tracking?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Domestic post is running slow atm, just had a domestic order sent regular mail take a week from one capital city to another. The only domestic seizures I've heard of were in some small town near Perth where the local LE clearly short of more productive use of their time conducted a operation on the mail simply due to the very low numbers of mail coming through the sorting office and I think that was just o/s mail too. More likely you order wasn't shipped when marked in transit and its in the Christmas post.

    That sounds like what's happened. Although there are other possible scenarios, some vendors do this so you don't cancel your order. It sucks, but it's nothing new.  :)

    Christmas post might be slow but I ordered from 1stop Tuesday afternoon 18th Dec. He marked it in transit that night and it STILL has not arrived. I haven't written it off just yet but his comms are far from good and my last bag is almost empty - really not looking forward to chasing local stuff pre NY... Faaaaaaaarrk!!!

    Can't be fucked writing a new one for the same type of thread so cut and paste it it;

    A vendor that has the feedback, transactions and reputation such as 1Stop deserves some benefit of the doubt IMO. You have no idea wtf has happened and for all we know the vendor could have had an accident, come down sick, been busted etc etc. Hold back on the flames till you get the hot tip about whats going on here. I notice no 1Stop listings too so this could be more serious than just a bag or 2 of weed so spare a thought for them too..... I don't think they would have no listings and be messing a customer around if they had the choice (1Stop was always focused on customer satisfaction from what I know and was a point of personal pride for them) sucks I know but you need to just chill out and wait... and maybe clean house too especially if its your real name and address that you gave over for the order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FTP.... FTP..... never thought I would actually say that but more and more its how I feel. There just doesn't seem to be any balance there any more and its all about fucking people lives at the worst time they can... say Christmas for example. So while they go for the money shots and big ticket items, drug users and sellers the violent criminals are given good behavior bond and go kidnap and rape and murder young girls... Fuck The Police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope your all good wherever you are 1Stop mate... thoughts and prayers are with you.

    No one is out to screw/fuck anyone over, especially an aussie vendor.
    <br/>
    This is about a complete lack of communication from a vendor to his customer, thats all.
    <br/>
    I dont believe in burning bridges.
    <br/>
    But Someoneelse87 has waited a long time for a domestic delivery and he has every right to wax lyrical about it.

    Its also very easy for a vendors friend to jump on here and give them support because of a fuck up....
