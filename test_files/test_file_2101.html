    Depends on how they shipped.
    <br/>
    1st class? Priority? Express? (hope not)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say fair to say 4 days. Up to 7.

    It depends how fast the postman can run.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But seriously, In transit doesn't necessarily mean they actually even shipped it yet.  A few sellers say that just to get money before they post it out (helps with cash flow management).

    First class domestic-3 to 5 days.
    <br/>
    Priority domestic-2 to 5 days.
    <br/>
    Express-1 to 2 days i believe.
    <br/>
    Pidgin-15 to 25 days depending on if it's bird season.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, marked in transit doesn't always mean it's been shipped. Dcn's can also take a long time updating.

    You probably mean the usps, right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is important to note the difference between ups and usps
