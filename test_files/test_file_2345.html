    Received package and it had yellow tape on the outside saying it had been opened but nothing removed. On the inside was a pamphlet say it had been opened by Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service because a item of concern was detected by AQIS screening process which uses detector dogs and xray.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Found other reports of same thing.

    I am thinking these guys are looking more plant and animal material that could carry disease more than drugs.

    I'm assuming this is a package sent from NL?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They can only inspect the package so far before they need a warrant, this is too time consuming. So unless there is strong evidence to suggest there is illicit drugs concealed inside they will seal it back up.

    That was what I was assuming, I am just wondering if they would flag from this? If they did, thier list of flagged addresses is going to have lot of innocents on it and become useless to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wonder what they monitor the most, address or names or both?

    Country in question was not NL. (dunno if I should name it or not)

    This is really common and generally nothing to worry about. If the stuff was small and well packaged they probably didn't see it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AQIS is looking for quarantine risks - fruit/veg/flora/fauna/wood/dirt/herbs etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No,  Australian Customs and AQIS do not need a warrant to search - open - and or destroy anything sent into Australia.

    Was published as the closing paragraph in a report from one of the Aussie based newspapers from a few weeks back I think. The entire time I read the article I was thinking about what the quarantine and border control statistics might really be and there it was, closing paragraph - I literally loled -then did a database search on the postal claim and it seems to be legit. I've heard the figure for air cargo repeated around that low mark from a few different places too and sea cargo logistically it would be just impossible to check all.

    I've heard that a very small percentage of sea cargo gets checked at all. From my reading of various news reports it seems that most who get busted for importing large quantities of drugs were already under observation/investigation and that's why they got caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also had a look at a report on 2011 mail drug seizures for Australia, and there was something in the region of 100 for the entire year (MDMA) and almost all were sea freight.

    Good idea. You can not be too paranoid about stuff like this, although I'd say it's unlikely they'd have found anything if they didn't confiscate/do a controlled delivery. Unless it was 80kg of H in tomato cans... ;)
