    Ｉcould probably get high quality heroin from burma and ship it direct， the reason i didnt before is because I didnt know anyone who would want it， but now with SR it would be something I potentially look at。 any idea of what prices I could sell at on SR within Australia？

    100% success here with 30 purchases (only about 5 of them have been heroin), my success rate seems like it's about to go down now though, an item has been lost in transit :(

    I think it was mostly incoming from abroad but apparently they had been monitoring things coming into the country.

    Was the article you were speaking about where 20m of drugs were seized about a month ago? If so there was a thread dedicated to it. The follow up article from customs said they check only a very small % of incoming mail with most of it being from high risk countries ie Netherlands
