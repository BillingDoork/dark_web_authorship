    Assuming for the moment there has not been any red flags (no shipments inexplicably missing, no customs letters, etc)...I assume it's probably a good idea to change PO boxes or receiving addresses every so often just in case someone does have their eye on your shipments, to throw them off, or make it harder to build a case over time.  This would work esp good if you have a box with a business address and you're using a local mom and pop mailbox store (as has been suggested before).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm trying to get an idea of which buyers do change addresses periodically, how often they do it, etc.  Especially if you're not using a fake ID.  I'm thinking about doing it myself (after X months at my current address) and want to figure out what works for others and whether if I'm jumping the gun or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've also heard of people having multiple addresses at the same time which they rotate around.  But with the reading I've done it seems this is just something large bulk shipment buyers/resellers do, as opposed to those buying for your own use.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And before you tell me I'm worrying too much: I only buy for my own use BUT I do regularly buy a couple weeks worth of stuff at a time which, while well under the amounts I've seen for distribution, its still enough to make me worry that some of my shipments don't quite fit into that "personal use" category.  So I am trying to be a little more careful than average for a buyer.

    They can't open your mail, and if you receive mail often, chances are your mailman isn't really caring. I can honestly see this multiple address thing giving you more of an issue than just using one.

    Railgun has a valid and simple point there. Your asking a very subjective question. Im sure lots of users have their own system or preferred method of ordering, that does not entail using the same drop constantly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally dont give it much thought, i have 2 drops. One for orders from new vendors and for samples, and the other for my 'ace in the hole' buys. The mail man for my home leaves mail in my box for tenants that havnt lived here for years. In almost every case, the mail men just want to finish their route and get home.

    Your worrying WAY to much my friend! There is absolutely ZERO reason to have to change the address you use unless something gets seized, and even then domestic things still come just fine and personally I know tons of people that have had international seizures and continued to order to the same address with no issues (not saying this is smart)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a vendor, I have quite a few big bulk buyer that live across the border. Since these guys order such big amount so often, I recognize they are always using the same address as there is absolutely no point in changing drops unless something goes wrong. People receive all sorts of mail from all over the place every day man....It doesn't matter if your getting 10 packages from overseas a week. The mailman could care less about where your mail is coming from or how much your getting. All he wants to do is finish his route and go home. Fuck, the probably don't even look at the return address, they just want to put it in the receivers mailbox and GTHH (get the hell home) and with SO much online shopping going on these days, there are tons of people that receive a shit load of mail from different countries every day of the week. Do you honestly think the mailman wonders in his head "wow I wonder why this person gets so much mail from so many different places" Because they don't think like that. You do not ever need to switch drops unless there is a problem, especially as just a personal user! :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that helps! :)

    To clarify, I am NOT talking about the reg mailman or the workers at the mailbox store fucking with my mail.  I'm talking about a shipment being opened, measured, sent on to me without a controlled delivery, and thus beginning an investigation where they keep track of how many drug shipments I get until they have enough to get a warrant/bust me for a larger amount of drugs than any one shipment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THEY DO DO THIS.  I had it happen to a friend.  Not every discovered shipment is going to result in either confiscation or a CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I am trying to do by switching boxes is to avoid this scenario.  I have no way of knowing if they've found something and are thus investigating, so perhaps better to switch mailboxes (ie addresses and business names) every so often to disappear from the radar for that box.

    Um, I know you say you had that situation happen to a friend of yours but I have a really hard time believing that...If they find drugs in the mail I am pretty much 100% posititive by law they cannot allow you to keep receiving them until  they have enough to build a case on you. Especially if you are not even signing for the drugs, they are not at all proving the person is intentionally ordering drugs to his house no matter how many times it happens....What if they allowed the drugs to be delivered and a child ingested them and died or something? I am sorry but I have been in the mail order game a VERY long time and have talked to TONS of people who have gotten a shit load of seizure letters for personal amount drugs and yet they still continue to order to the same address and usually everything gets through fine and if it doesn't, all they get is a seizure letter...

    I rotate between two addresses, and make sure never to have 2 orders on the way simultaneously to the same one.  Nothing would be worse than having one seized and another on the way IMO.  I've been lucky all of my 30+ packages are accounted for.  If one went missing I would definitely consider burning that address.  I deal all-domestic so I expect and have gotten 100% delivery.  International buyers probably have different criteria.

    Well I cant make you believe anything you dont want to, but there are also threads on this forum about people who have had the same thing happen to them.  One of them was titled "Busted.Charged" and it was from a western EU country (probably the UK also the poster didnt say because litigation was still pending at the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about it.  They do this kind of thing with IRL dealers all the time or receiving stolen goods/RICO crimes: make numerous controlled buys and document (even participate in) reups, allowing the dealer to remain in business while enough evidence for a big conviction is accumulated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They absolutely (at least in the US) can catalog, measure, and examine your drugs and then let them go on to your destination...repeating this procedure while either waiting to see if a large shipment to come through and/or waiting until you accumulate enough weight to make a non-CD search warrant happen, and the charges stick.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do some forum searching and you'll find out info that backs me up.

    if the drop address was clean this could probably be easily beaten.. for example how could they prove that a neighbor did not order the drugs to their address and then take them from their mailbox before the other person notices.. i know plenty of people that do not check their mail on a daily basis..

    Burning drop addresses and acquiring new ones are routine for the extra cautious.  For example, a well known vendor on another forum I associated with had a huge MDMA operation, this vendor shipped using 3 return addresses and rotated between them.  Later along the way the vendor was put under investigation and anything being sent out with those three return addys were flagged, many arrests happened, some customers were probably put under investigation, but those who forsure were not put under investigation were those who frequently used new drop locations.  Remember, if something would to arise, they can pull up every piece of mail that has been delivered to that location and mountains of evidence can pile up.  But for the average joe, no, you do not have to be cautious to this level.
