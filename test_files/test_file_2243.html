    Hi, I'm a newbie to the SR forums, been browsing and wishing I could order legal SR products but I do not have an address to ship them to. I've been thinking about a million different ways to get them and I came up with a crazy idea that may sound ridiculous but I thought might just work. I like to call it Anonymous P2P Dropshipping or AP2PDS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The most important part of this plan is that the package, supplier and recipient all remain anonymous.
    <br/>
    Rules to make this possible:
    <br/>
    A) The contents of the package are anonymous to the dropshipper and also must be legal, obviously.
    <br/>
    B) You don't know who the supplier/recipient is, it is assumed that everybody is a dropshipper, but only the middle man will receive compensation by escrow.
    <br/>
    C) The website does not know where you do your business
    <br/>
    D) You set up user profile (Private/Public) and create your own network of peers that you trust your products with, whether delivered by person locally/globally or by mail.
    <br/>
    E) Make a review system of users so they know who they can trust.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know this sounds sketchy but, it is not illegal to give your friend a package. I truly believe this could be the way of the future for shipping and although some of you may be may be scared to dropship considering people may ship illegal product but you can at least deny you knew anything which is the truth. Another upside is using bitcoins shows no evidence of ever selling anything.

    Its definitely illegal to give your friend a package if its contents are illegal. if someone hands you $100 and says "Hey, deliver this package to this sketchy guy's house, don't worry about what is inside" and you get caught you might as well be the drug dealer.

    Heck my friend got charged for constructive possession in georgia because some girl had a couple grams of herb with her in the car, in her own purse. He ended up serving more than 6 months probabation for that.

    You really have no idea what you are saying.

    The point of the whole thing is you are assuming it is legal. And I'm sure people could get busted but I figured at the least you could have the chance to deny it. Idk it's more of a dream but I feel like there's gotta be a way to get creative and make some better distribution for SR.

    It doesn't work like that. If someone gives you a package to deliver you would still get in trouble for what is in it. Thats like being the driver for a hooker and pretending you don't know what she does in strangers houses.

    I'll volunteer to be your first middleman drop shipper.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if the packages get to you empty, I'm just saying the original vendor must've been a scammer! The bastard!!!
