    Im pretty new here and im just using the silk road to get a few pills and maybe a bit of powder
    <br/>
    but I have a good mate who loves his green!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im just wonder how risky is it shipping weed to ireland, anyone had any luck doing it?
    <br/>
    If so can what vendor are you using?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I see most of the weed vendors won't ship international, There is one I have found who does and has got really good prices. Swazibudbud888 anyone use him?

    Never had a problem :) I don't think it's any riskier than any other country. Nobodys ever had a problem :D Swazibudbud888 is a nice guy but he's really busy. His weed is good i hear but i would stick to domestic if you can for your first few orders. I could sort you a nice deal out if you're looking to buy regularly?

    Well unfortunately I can't stick to domestic as there are no vendors here in the republic.
    <br/>
    So your in the UK, I would be feel safer buying from someone not to far away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ill talk to my mate, I say at first he would just get a few grams of the lemon haze to test out but if all goes well yeah I say you would have a new regular customer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will let him know, Get some coin together and talk to you on your vendor page.Â  ;D
