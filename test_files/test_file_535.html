    How safe is it to receive large quantities of ecstasy pills? Say 100 pills, 200 pills, and 500 pills?
    <br/>
    Buying from a reputable vendor of course, and international, not domestic.
    <br/>
    And would these be enough for LE to pay you a visit? (Not small quantities anymore? or still considered small?)

    LE would pay you a visit for sure with that amount of pills...even 10 pills they would give you a visit, a letter, or a controlled delivery, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you wanted that many, then you would have enough cash to fly over to europe, then pack and send them yourself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its very possible, but would you trust a vendor to ship 100-500rds from NL? Unless you have a fake named box, i wouldnt do it, but even then...

    Those kind of deals happen here daily. Just follow the buyers guide to stay safe. There is never a guarantee that you wont get a visit.

    Okay, obviously if you order 200 you're asking for a CD if the package is found. Are you in high demand for these pills as a dealer, or do you just want to stock up? My best advice would be to order the pills from many trusted vendors in small quantities (1-5 pills), and see which vendor has the best product and best stealth. I would then buy around 30 of them from the same vendor you choose, and sample them with your market to make sure that everyone likes the product. From there I would move to 200, and that would still be a crazy amount for one order.

    100+ amount being shipped would never be considered "safe".  Mailing drugs in general is never really "safe".  There's no 100% fool proof way to package any type of drug once it is opened and inspected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, like mentioned people import hundreds and thousands of pills, bricks, pounds, kilos Etc everyday. You just have to be smart about it.  In this game, there is never a guarantee.

    Consider (although this is in australia) that a recent large music festival the cops made a media release where they boasted of 100 drug related arrests in an otherwise peaceful day. The thing that raised my eyebrow was they proudly singled out in this media release the details of their biggest catch.
    <br/>
    a "dealer". A chap who was taken into custody, immediate bail denied.
    <br/>
    his crime? he was found in possession of 30 ecstasy tablets.

    I would assume he is trying to sell them.  Selling colorful designer pressed pills is much more easier to the general party rave go-ers. I mean there is a reason why they make them colorful and press designs on to them.

    <br/>
    Or OP could just push molly crystals.

    Making caps is cheaper per, and so so so much easier to get through customs. I'd love to not have to fuck around with caps and get presses, but it's just not worth it.
