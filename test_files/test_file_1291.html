    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd like to try some new vendors which are not domestic, and I never ordered anything outside my country before.
    <br/>
    The borders are open thanks to the schengen agreement. I'm very curious how the postal system actually works between EU countries...
    <br/>
    I'd love to know the real risk, some vendors say it's as "safe" as a domestic order... but I'm a bit sceptical :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't ever order anything that is shipped from the netherlands though, for obvious reasons :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd appreciatey any tips and insights.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers!

    You've got the right idea so far, truth is now there are enough people redibbing for overseas vendors that you can get everything here now without taking that risk...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now if your buying bulk it's a different story, the biggest factor now is stealth....

    This is not so obvious though, unless one can categorically state the Netherlands is just as safe as domestic then obviously the risk is greater. The first and main indicator of your security is what country you're in and what kind of procedures they have in place. I live in Sweden myself and our customs is the equivalent to the Australian Customs in terms of efficiency in seizing packages, why this is the case no one is really sure of but it could be they're simply opening a lot of packages on random which other countries customs agencies might not do. It is probably true in general though that EU to EU is less complex in general than having a package with a customs declaration coming from outside EU.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The secondary issue is the packaging itself, anyone who's listed in the thread STEALTH THAT WORKS - DITCH THE PE FOOD GRADE VAC SEAL: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0 will be significantly safer than anyone who isn't.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The third issue would be the drug and quantity, shipping 200 grams of hash in a parcel versus 1 gram of MDMA powder in a very small business envelope is obviously very different in terms of risk of getting caught. If you're ordering LSD from a reputable vendor it might not even matter the letter is from the Netherlands as most of them won't have any way of detecting it without knowing in advance what it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my perspective. :)

    I agree shipping and receiving LSD within the EU is about as safe as it gets. Just make sure you pick a vendor that does use some stealth in case your letter gets randomly opened  ;)

    Thanks for your replies so far guys :)

    @White 0ut: I think I understood what you said, but what does "redibbing" mean? I tried to look that word up with no luck. But what you are saying is that alot of people (in the USA I assume?) are not ordering from overseas anymore because they can get everything domestically? Overseas is a whole different story... I ordered overseas twice in my whole life... and it were actually no drugs! lol Both times I got a letter from customs that I should go pick up my parcel and bring a receipt so I can pay the import taxes... First time I ordered a PS3 game for $40 from Canada, 4 weeks later I got the customs letter. Second time was a small order from China with some tech goodies worth total $60, again I got a customs letter. No way I'm gonna order any drugs at all overseas.
    <br/>
    The PS3 game was in a small bubble envelope, go figure...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I agree with you guys that shipping LSD must the safest thing to ship. I just don't know any people yet that that are into LSD and would like to buy some.

    yes, you nailed it. People are selling overseas product here.  So why take the risk!

    If you do go overseas, go with the best, most popular, chances are that's your best chances!

    I live in EU country, all orders I made were only from EU countries. 100% successful over 1.5 years.
    <br/>
    I ordered a lot of times from Netherlands and Germany. Few times from Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Czech Republic, Sweden, France, UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I found this statement on the official website of post service in the country I currently live in:
