    Ok - I live in another state, a vendor from CA sent me a DCN that produced the below info - That person is telling me that my address was no good and was undeliverable - I know my address is good but they put a fake address on as the return..  So there is no way of knowing where this ended up or why it was marked as an undeliverable address - the way I interpret the below info is that the letter was addressed to a CA address and was addressed wrong and returned to the Napa address. What's your opinion

    You are correct, that is saying that the package was sent to Napa, CA and the PO was unable to deliver it, so if you don't live in Napa then I suggest you point this out to the vendor in a polite way and let him know this can't possibly be your DCN.

    Thanks -  that's what I assumed... but whenever I assume this quote comes to mind “When you assume, you make an ass out of u and me.” Oskar Wilde

    <br/>
    The vendor has been working to make it right by me and very insistent on doing so even offering a refund.... Please note I say refund and not work it out though SR escrow because my own mistake everyone should be aware of.... I always try to give feedback and release from escrow as soon  as I receive my order.  Well the other day I received some good H from my reliable H vendor tomorrowman, and my eyes were not focusing too good and I accidentally clicked the finalize on this order - well I found out that if you do that, there is no going back, there is no are you sure you want to do this button - anyways when I saw the next screen I was with it enough to see that this wasn't right so I didn't do the final step in giving the rating/review..... this had the effect of not transferring the money but taking the order out of escrow.  So I had to release it anyways to work with the vendor on that. Long story but something you guys should be aware of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways I will I will post how it works out - So far his communication and customer service can be considered great if I get what I am supposed to.

    Thanks for your opinions

    Forgive me if I misread you but when you finalize, the BTC IS in fact released. This is regardless if you leave feedback immediately or save it for later.

    ITT the package was sent FROM Napa, CA and the sorting facility in Oakland determined that the address was undeliverable, and returned it to sender. thats why it ended up in Napa, CA.
