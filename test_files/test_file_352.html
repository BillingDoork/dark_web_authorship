    So, I got my first package from SR and what can I say. I'm thrilled, obviously! First that I got it, second that I didn't get a love letter instead, third that there wasn't LE hiding in the bushes, etc, etc.. How ungrateful can I be, really? I am plenty fucking grateful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I need to provide feedback and I am hesitant about providing an unqualified 5/5. No compromising details here regarding shipping. Just the following:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Hand-written addresses. To me this is a nonissue. It's Christmas time. I think handwritten actually seems *more* authentic than printed label, but I include this in case anyone has a view
    <br/>
    2) Street name mis-spelled. This kind of pisses me off. I was going to say in my original order "please cut and paste address so as to avoid error" but I didn't want to sound like a tool (and, hand-written anyway, couldn't be done as it turns out). But this, I understand, is the kind of thing that gives postal carriers/inspectors pause. I'm not happy.
    <br/>
    3) Stealth. Here I'm drawing on conversations I've followed on the forums. On the outside it's fine. Perfect. No complaints. On the inside it's dead obvious. No attempt to hide product whatsoever. Product is all there is. So what version of stealth do I go by when rating this thing? Had the package been torn, I'd be boned. Had the package been opened due to the mis-spelled address or for some other suspicion, I'd be boned. Because neither of those things happened, I was fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do I rate this?
    <br/>
    Also: I'm aware that vendors want "the chance to make things right" prior to providing anything less than a 5/5, and I'm definitely ok with doing that, but what can make this right, exactly? It's not like the package never showed up. That being said, I have ONE address to make work and no alternates. If it gets burnt due to vendor carelessness, my SR days are over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you think?

    Anything less that 5/5 is viewed as negative feedback as it lowers the vendors score. If you're just referring to the score you give in a review then give him whatever you think is fair but if you're talking about the vendors actual feedback I would give them a 5/5 unless you never plan on ordering from them again.
    <br/>
    As a side note, I've received numerous international orders with security like what you describe, and every single one has gotten through (from the Netherlands too) . It has to be pretty suspicious to get sent to secondary, and unless you're ordering over a gram of powder it's unnecessary imho.

    Two ideas:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i) Give the 5/5 but write the vendor, urging a little more caution in future. Nothing at stake for the vendor (but I also can't be thought to be extorting the vendor for perfect feedback) but a friendly heads-up; or
    <br/>
    ii) Give the 5/5 so the stats don't change but actually remark at issues in feedback so it shows on the vendor feedback if people look
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be easy to let the happiness and relief of getting my package erase any desire to complicate things but I would hate to let this go and someone else end up paying the price next week or month because the vendor didn't get the message that they need to be a bit more careful.

    Yes this sounds pretty standard... If it was domestic i wouldnt worry to much...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The hand printed label.......sucks!
    <br/>
    the missed spelled addy.... sucks!!
    <br/>
    not great stealth on the inside....not a huge deal if domestic,but the more stealth the better
    <br/>
    Hope the product was vac sealed (few times depending on product)
    <br/>
    receiving the package.... priceless!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but just send a message to the vendor about your concerns, the more you help them the better the future looks

    Went for option #2, after checking that other people do this, too (provide 5/5 but with constructive criticism). Wanted to choose a course quickly so as to release the escrow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And... that concludes the entire cycle of my first SR purchase!
    <br/>
    Well, minus one step. Time to get high as fuck.

    Cheers, fellows.

    In my experience, that is shitty packaging, but you got real drugs, so not worth anything less than 5/5 on the SR rating system.

    I agree with this:

    I would go with option 1 first since you're new. Somebody with more reputation in the community can more effectively publicly criticize a vendor.

    I am pretty vulnerable as a new buyer and so yeah, I don't do any of this lightly. It makes it super tempting to just leave well enough be, but I'm trying to do right by SR. Hopefully the vendor takes it in the spirit intended.

    Not expecting an answer - but I really hope this is just a domestic vendor and not international.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because that's some extra-retarded shit right there for an international vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm also impressed that as a first-time buyer you didn't have to FE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Congrats on your first successful mission, I'll be following suit very soon.

    Yes, sorry, should have specified. Domestic, which is all I plan to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no plans to do business with a vendor who forces FE. I do have one vendor in mind who I like the look of who will waive the FE when I hit 5 purchases, so I'm simply doing business with other people until then.
