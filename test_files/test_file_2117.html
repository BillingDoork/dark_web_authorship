    ok so all over the forums people say not to open your package straight away and to wait a couple hours until you do or the police will bust you..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    tbh i dont understand how waiting could really make a difference, i mean even if you didnt open it straight away i dont see whats stopping them from coming in unless they are watching you or happen to know when you have opened it? What could waiting even prevent if you wait 2 - 3 hours they ay still come in at the time regardless, you cant say when they will...
    <br/>
    My opinion is to not open the package where you get it delivered to, go to another place and do it and make sure you dont leave the packages at your house or the place of deliverey

    All the information you require regarding this subject can be found by clicking on the "Silk Road wiki" ( found at the bottom of your home page ). Regarding the opening of a package, when you receive it you should write "Return To Sender" on the back and set it aside for a day or so. I realize that this may not be an ideal proposition for a lot of us, who have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of some goodies and just want to tear open the package and hook into it, however, it's taking a step towards minimizing any involvement you may of had in that package arriving at a place where you either live or visit.

    Write return to sender, and leave it inside the house for a few days? This whole idea is quite a scary thought. Can't one argue, "how am I supposed to control what somebody else ships to me?"

    Bit of a grey area?
    <br/>
    Any normal person would not not open a package addressed to them, maybe if it was a fake or old householders name yea but not yr own name.
    <br/>
    How many times in yr life have u recieved something and written return to sender on it just because u don't know what is is or who sent it? I would open anything addressed to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe a better way would be to either leave it in yr letter box for a day or get the package and hide it well.
    <br/>
    Without a substance there can't be a case, what could they do?

    Exactly. I think buyers just need to bite the bullet and determine what is the best method for them personally. Paranoia can be a good thing, but it can also be a bastard of a thing, especially when you're sweating about the drugs in the mail on the way to your address....

    In the UK they don't wait a while before 'busting in'. They just get you to sign then pull the handcuffs out their back pockets and whack them on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's normally blatantly obviously an undercover officer though, they'll turn up in some crappy banged out civilian car and be wearing tatty normal clothing, not a uniform. They won't have ID either and will seem a bit 'nervous' (looking around etc).

    That doesn't sound plausible to me. Just being in possession of drugs is illegal. You open the package, you are in possession of the contents. Sure they'd love to get you on trafficking/importation/whatever else, but possession is 9/10ths of the law.

    Just because the package is open doesn't justify that its now in your possession. I mean the paranoia can take over and simply having that bit of mail un opened could be possession cant it? You can claim to not know the contents but your in possession of it, may have signed for it and its addressed to you??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think if your gonna get done you'll get done... face the facts. Through the bitcoin system and the annon of silk just stick to your story and they cant link it to you. Remember you are innocent until proven guilty... THEY have to prove your guilty you dont have to, thats your right as a citizen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The end of the day if you receive your package open it and it aint narcotics then expect your door to be kicked down and cuffs around ur wrists. They take possession of the item first before sending it to you, wait for you to sign then arrest you for attempted importation, receivership etc

    If it's a traffickable amount (&gt;0.75g of mdma in nsw!), then the onus is on you to prove that you aren't dealing. That's what gets me. How do you prove you are not doing something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Believe what you want to believe. We're all just speculating anyway, with nobody here who is an expert on the law, and nobody chiming in who has been busted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most likely if it comes to your door you are in the clear. But I have heard rumours about missing packages causing problems and coming back to bite people a few months later... Even very small packages.
    <br/>

    Just be careful. Best of luck to everyone.

    In the US, simply signing a package is not enough to convict.  However, signing for a package, and also being found with any other illegal drugs, is a whole different story.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But really, this topic has been beaten to death.  When you get your package, just open it.  it's not like waiting a few hours is gonna make the sting team go "hmm, I guess we were wrong" and leave.  If it's a controlled delivery, you can't stop it from happening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My roommate a few years back IRL got a controlled delivery for having a lb of mj shipped to his home.  He cleaned house before the delivery, and even though he signed for and opened the package before he was caught, he was acquitted of the charge.  His only defense what that he wasn't expecting any packages, and did not know who had sent it.  In the absence of any other damning evidence, they won't convict.  There are dozens of precedents.

    I know you're "supposed" to wait a bit before opening it, just in case of a raid, but to be honest, I don't think I've ever waited longer than an hour to open a package.  I've received multiple letters, boxes, and padded envelopes.  I feel it out.  If there are no suspicious vehicles outside, and the package doesn't seem to have been inspected or tampered with, I write "Return to Sender" on it, take a shower, and if nobody is at my door by the time I'm all clean, I bust out the drugs.  Then I burn the packaging.   ;D  So far, so good!
