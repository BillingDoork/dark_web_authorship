    I am very curious as to what your opinions are on the safety of the various places we can have packages delivered to.  I personally have my stuff going to a personal mail box not ups store but something very similar to that.  I know all the people that work there and if a package requires a signature they sign for me and hold my stuff behind the counter.  The reason I went with personal mailbox was because of the fact that if a controlled delivery was going to happen, LEO would have to stake out the store and wait for me to come.  This could take days etc after the package was initially delivered.  I don't think they would sit around this long to do this.  In my opinion they would probably call me and ask me to come to pick up the package.  I would think a USPS postal inspector would dress in plain clothes like the rest of the employees and try to get me to sign for package when I arrive there.  I know all the employees here and it would be obvious as soon as I walked into the door if it was some guy behind the counter that I have never seen before.  That would be my que to walk out and never come back.  If I am never in possession of the package how could I ever be charged with possession of its contents?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know that some people say they don't like the thought of there packages being at the mercy of the workers at these places.  I completely understand that.  I would say if you watch reviews and the stealth and packaging methods are sufficient you should be confident that your product will not spill out or smell through the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think an ideal set up would be to find a place that accepts packages and allows rentals of mail boxes and use a fake ID and cash to rent the box.  This way your identity is not tied to the box in anyway.  If you get sketched out or something out of the ordinary occurs just take it as a loss and find another place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I fear very much having a package seized in customs and law enforcement attempting a controlled delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think is the safest delivery locations (home, PO Box, or Personal Mail Box)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Enlighten me!

    the home would be ideal because all you got to do is not open the door or decline to accept it if you think something is wrong and just say you werent expecting anything. a po box or private mailbox rental would be alot harder for your lawyer to prove you werent expecting anything.also with the house deliverys i just post up at the store and grab a bite to eat and see if i can see vehicles that dont belong in my neighborhood rolling up when the mailman does.i only buy personal amounts and some i can share with my girl or friends but u can never be too careful,or paranoid!i dont think anyone who has a private mailbox talk about it and just hope their chosen vendor knows how to pack and everything should be alright.

    I have been looking for a better drop myself after a recent incident and hoping a few more would add to this thread. Lots of UPS stores around and some have 24hr access it appears but still leery about this option. Help!

    Here's what I'm going to do- I bought a fake ID here on SR (from Havemeier if you need one they are GREAT for the money) and I purchased a throw away cell with cash. I'm going to a UPS store to rent a box with my fake ID. I'm going to mail myself a bunch of crap at this address using envelopes and boxes similar to those my sellers use. UPS store has a cool feature- they will send you a text msg when you have a package! So I'll use the throw away cell number for that. I will also ignore many of these texts, as they will be caused by things I sent myself, so the staff will not expect me to come racing in whenever I get a text. I will NOT send myself anything near the times I make my orders. If then, when I make an order, if I get an actual person calling me to tell me I have a package, I will NOT go get it. I'll wait for days or weeks or may even fuck off the box if I feel sketchy. I'm really actually OK with using my own house but I live with others and I can't put them at risk. I will RELAX. I will enjoy SR. I will thank my lucky stars for Tor and technology. I will NOT be excessively paranoid, but I will be intelligent. I will get HIGH!

    Thanks for the information and sounds like a decent plan. I guess the value of those places is the unpredictability of when you will be there to pick up so CD would be impossible. Any camera concerns at those stores?

    I myself don't personally worry about cameras, but if you were so inclined, I would wear sunglasses and/or a hat. Even tho your ID is fake, I am assuming they have face matching tech if they got a good enough shot of your face straight on. But they could do that using the pic on the fake DL to match to a real state issued ID in their database. But that would prob be Fed or higher level LE so I would be less worried about that. One could also procure a hat that uses a blast of IR light to obscure the area directly around the face to anyone looking on a camera. The light is invisible to anyone looking at you IRL. Check Youtube for vids about those hats.

    No delivery location is truly safe if youre planning on picking up the product yourself anyway. Its better to do your research on vendors and find one who overall has overwhelming praises about their stealth, that way youre more at ease when making decisions such as this one.
