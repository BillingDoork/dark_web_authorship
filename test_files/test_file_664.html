    From what I've gathered, basically someone who isnt your usual mailman (police officer in disguise) will try to get you to sign for your package. Upon doing so, your house is immediately raided. Is that all?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can your house be raided WITHOUT a controlled delivery occurring first?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To avoid a controlled delivery and get out okay, can you just refuse to sign and tell the "mailman" you don't want the package?

    Just stick to the sr wiki and write rts on the package and leave it in plain sight for a day if you are worried.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This whole thing about signing for a package is crap in my opinion, i order lots of stuff from ebay and have to sign for most of them and most of the time i have no idea what the package is going to look like when i get it nor do i know whats inside because i have many packages on the way at anyone time.... If a package rocked up i would no doubt sign for it, i have asked alot of ppl i know that question and they all say the same thing.... yes i would sign for a package if one rocked up.... Anyone can send you anything.
    <br/>
    That top piece of info is what would save your arse and also having everything tor related on your pc encrypted will do wonders too.
    <br/>
    More research on your part would help you greatly, maybe try the Security section.

     Signature or no signature, they need a warrant to raid your house.  The vast majority of the time customs will only send a letter.  The cases of controlled delivery that I've heard about over the years involve people that have a criminal record or that were on parole at the time of the delivery.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They don't convict people because they signed for a package.  People get into trouble for (1) confessing and (2) having drugs in the house.

    Even though I do agree with most of what you have posted I would just urge caution in that I recently had my perceptions regarding how LE deal with intercepts (even small ones) challenged considerably. You don't read about it much on here with probable good reason but I can tell you they may follow up and attempt a CD even if its to a clean address and addressed to someone with no criminal record. I'm sure it is extremely rare but it is still good to know that it can happen and as such you should take precautions accordingly.

    I don't think criminal records really have anything to do with a CD. Usually, it has to do with someone that placed a large order, as far as I know. Never heard of a CD for a gram of weed or a couple pills (knock on wood).

    There seem to be hundreds of people maybe thousands that think because they have never been in trouble before with the police or tha because they'r house is clean they wont get raided, believe me, You can get raided whenever, they only need "probably cause" which can be anything they fucking want. If they want a warrant, All they say is i heard unusual noises that sounded ";like" (notice the like) screams coming from inside the property.
    <br/>
    Your like Wtf bullshit, But the judge is like, Police officer or someone i dont even fucking know? Hmm.
    <br/>
    There's a million probable cause things they could pull, Smelled ganja heard screams, Saw suspicious activity through the window, if you leave anything unlocked they are allowed to enter it, even if your doors closed but unlocked, They can come in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the police knock your door, Do not answer, because rap and taps, Will get you busted. You can go to the window and say you are not letting them in. Even if they show Id you DO NOT have to let them in just because they are police. You just say Officer i respect your position , But due to "having kids in the house" being safety conscious" Anything you want, Im not letting you in , a citizen of the " -- " It is my right to choose not to allow entry to people into my home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dont let them bully you into letting them in by saying things like, "do you have something to hide" "normal citizens would let police officers in"
    <br/>
    YOU have the right to choose it is your house.
    <br/>
    IF THEY DONT HAVE A WARRANT WHEN THEY COME TO YOUR DOOR, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO GET ONE. DONT ANSWER ANYTHING THEY ASK YOU, DONT ANSWER YOUR DOOR, IF THEY SEE YOU OR YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THEM JUST SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY, DONT SPEND TIME ANSWERING THEIR QUESTIONS. YOU DO NOT NEED TO, YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT, AND AS OFFICERS OF THE LAW, NOT ONLY SHOULD THEY RESPECT ALL LAWS, BUT THEY SHOULD UPHOLD THEM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THEIR JOB IS TO PROTECT YOU AS A CITIZEN, THAT IS THEIR DUTY WHICH THEY HAVE SWORE AN OATH TO DO.
    <br/>
    Remember what you would be saying and how you'd be acting if you hadn't ordered from SR, Outraged and you would be informing the officers that if they didn't stop harrasing a normal citizen like you you will be making a complaint to their superior officer,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My money says that if a police officer actually did try this, and you played it so cool and actually phoned his precinct/ station and asked to speak to the desk sergeant or captain, and started complaining and making official complaints, That you want to make a formal complaint and take it right through the system unless you stop getting harassed immediately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they dont want the state sued, the captain will be like what evidence do you have ?
    <br/>
    hel say nothing and boom the captain will be telling him to haul ass so fast...

    Speaking of Controlled Delivery I believe I should have one today or tomorrow. You see I ordered a KILO of a schedule 1 controlled substance that nobody would want to get caught with EVER or they would be doing at least 5 to 10 with about a gram. I'm talking schedule 1 narcotic in powdered form that could make you rich as fuck if you were to get your hands on it. That's why I took my chances AND because I had done at least 5 orders with this supplier and every single one of them got through without a hitch. Of course they were all schedule 4 narcotics (Benzos).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways I spent about $8,000 on it from Asia (worth at least 1 million on the street or probably more on the road.) Anyways it gets to customs shipped EMS on January 27 at 1:30am. Then I wait. I've never waited more than 3 days for a package shipped EMS and what do you know but TODAY it finally gets through customs st 12:30am. LOL. Like I'm gonna take this fucking bait. Hell I'd be in jail for the rest of my fucking life! Fuck the money. This is an obvious setup.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways if you suspect a controlled delivery then trust your gut! It most likely is! Don't get fucked and end up in hand cuffs and HELL. Hell I even had my lease over with and I took off from that place. For all they know I'm in butt fucking Egypt. (Plus I'm in between jobs.) Also thank God my family lives in another state so they don't know shit about me moving.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways that's my story. Dont' let LE fuck with you. Some people would be all stoked their package finally got through customs after two weeks. FUCK THAT. Next thing they know they'll be in front of a judge charged with importing a fucking KILO of a schedule one narcotic.
    <br/>

    Be smart. Don't be a retard!

    ^ Dude this is a KILO of a schedule 1 narcotic. I would rather eat shit for the rest of my life that pick this package up. I'm not even gonna check out the spot. If it's been in customs this long than God knows it's a setup. Hell maybe if it was some xanax bars or some shit I would be a bit more understanding. But this is 100% pure opiate powder. I'd really rather not be hanging with my cell mate for the rest of my life!

    Also no - there is no way in hell I would send this to my place. Definitely one of my drops.

    Don't believe that stuff about the different mail man or writing RTS on the package. There were two CDs in my area this past fall. One was a guy who lived with his wife and parents. The package was an lb of weed. He signed for it, wrote RTS on it and set it aside, they raided the house and he was arrested and charged. It's still pending as far as I know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other was a guy who ordered some stuff from China (about a kilo I think). It was delivered by the regular mail person. As soon as the mail guy was gone the feds moved in and raided. The feds were tipped off by customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure there is a "standard" for CDs, it probably just depends on who is doing the investigation, etc.

    I still can't for the life of me see how you can found guilty of trafficking or sell and supply or even possession if the prosecutors can't prove that you knew what was in the package, that you ordered it, and paid for it. Especially if it isn't even in your name and has R.T.S written on it and hasn't been opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only evidence they have if you are doing your shit properly is that a package was sent to that address and you signed for it.

    Oh for sure, I was just trying to make the point that writing RTS on the package doesn't mean LE is going to turn around and go home, they are still going to try and make the case.
