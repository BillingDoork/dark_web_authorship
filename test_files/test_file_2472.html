    I received a package after waiting about a month.  The package seemed unopened, but contained only concealment materials (no actual product... I searched very carefully).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've never heard of this happening before.  I'm most afraid that, because the package arrived, I'm not going to get a re-ship from the seller.  The purchase was finalized early.  Like I said, it was taking over a month, so I didn't want an auto-finalize on my purchase stats.  I also don't want any refunds on my purchase stats.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is my best course of action to get the product I ordered?  It was one of SR's biggest sellers, and contacting him can be a nightmare.

    I think it would be a vendor mistake. I've never heard of customs doing this. If they were going to seize the package, they would just seize it. They wouldn't take the contents out, and then send you an empty parcel. Doesn't make much sense.

    Sounds like an issue with the vendor, whether it was an honest mistake or not, no idea. But customs wouldn't do that. I believe they'd either replace it with an inert substance resembling what was in the package and reseal it or just send a customs seizure notice.

    I didn't notice any evidence of tampering before opening the package myself.  It was sealed using a sticker with a return address, and the sticker had not been torn. God knows I tore into the package pretty quickly at the excitement of it arriving, so I could have missed some signs of tampering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree that this doesn't seem like something that customs would do.  I also don't believe it's something a seller would intentionally do.  If a seller was going to scam me, why go through all of the trouble of sending me a package at all.  I just want this to be rectified, without having to call out the seller by name (yet).

    OP for sure is thankful for that hint, LE too. You should not give any hints about packaging openly away like that, please edit your post. A simple PM would help the OP likewise next time.

    My buddy once had some steroids seized.  Customs opened up the pack.  Took each bottle out of the box...put the empty boxes back in, and sealed the package with customs tape.  And then sent it on its way to us.  So yes...they will take certain things out and continue mailing the pack.  Got the love letter a few weeks later in the mail.  But it was apparent that they did it.  Customs tape all over the damn package.

    I'll say this. A friend of mine recently got busted going to pick up a bunch of bud several states away after receiving several empty boxes in the mail rather than his weed. THIS WAS NOT RELATED TO SR IN ANY WAY. I only mention this because it seems to be a tactic that LE uses. Basically, they caught the guy that was sending it, had his phone and my guy was actually communicating with the police. After he sent them a total of around $40,000 and several empty boxes later, they convinced him to come pick it up and were waiting on him.

    This may not be your situation at all, but just wanted to share some info that might be useful.
