    I'm planning on making my first order on sr but I'm worried that by me using my real name and address I am taking too much of a chance...I share the mailbox with my neighbor so he checks the mail just as I do, and I am afraid if I put a different name it will not reach me or if it does my neighbor may take it and throw it away seeing how it doesn't have my name on it. So pretty much I'm asking is it really risky using your real name and address, my first purchase will be 10gs after that I plan on increasing if all goes well......Thanks for any input for a newby at all this

    Never ever use a fake name. Although I have, it increases the risk of not receiving the package. Its better to stay calm and use your own name and address. Dont think to much, its just a piece of mail like all the other mail. No one has X-ray vision, not even your neighbor. Hope this helps.

    There is a lot of discussion on here re the issue you have, in my country the name doesn't matter as it is not linked to an address, I could (and have) used fake names to add to the plausible deniable factor should anything go wrong. Never use a previous occupants name, you have no knowledge re possible redirection instructions that are in place, using your real name though does increase your association to the shipment. My advice would be to invest some time effort and energy into securing a safe drop not associated with you then you thus reducing the risks considerably.

    Don't worry and use your real name. There shouldn't be any proof you ordered the package if you're correctly using TOR, PGP, ect. anyway. Just because a package comes to you, doesn't give proof you ordered it.
