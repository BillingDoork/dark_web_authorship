    Compared to shipping heroin, cocaine, and even cannabis,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    would prescription drugs be more safer? or if any pills are found in a package do they set off alarms?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for example, neurontin, benzos, prescription pain killers, would raise less eyebrows than heroin, cocaine?

    Given the fact that you don't get your pills from the mail, but from the pharmacy, I think these packages would still be seized if found. In my country, it is illegal to have prescription medication that you are not prescribed (that counts especially for drugs that are usually abused)

    generally schedule iv and lower pharms will get you a love letter telling you to knock your shit off if they're intercepted since it's the feds' position that people ordering those are victims of online pharmacy spam. getting roxies intercepted would probably lead to a cd/raid though

    If you haven't got a prescription for the pharms then it's still illegal to obtain them. And yeh, huge pharms issues going on in the States/Canada/Oz regarding addiction, so it won't be taken lightly.
