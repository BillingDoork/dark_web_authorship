    Would love to order some items which aren't available for me domestically, but have not plucked up the courage to do so, as yet. Anyone from the UK had multiple international orders come through with success?

    I’m from the UK and overall shipping international has been successful for me. There is always a customs risk when shipping internationally so never purchase more than you can afford to lose. Purchase from reputable vendors who have experience shipping to the UK and smaller amounts are a lot easier to get through but sometimes it just comes down to luck lol.

    I've ordered roughly 12oz from muskabuzz over the course of about a year and they always arrive.

    Thanks guys!  ;) That sounds pretty promising. Only 2 seized packages out of 27 non-UK orders seems ok. Did you get into any bother with the seized packages?
