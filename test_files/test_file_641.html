    S.W.I.M. has a p.o. box and i am allowed to have my sr orders shipped there. It obviously isn't my own box, since my next order is coming in a box it most likely won't fit in the p.o. box. They hold your package and stick a little slip in your box. Do you think i will need to show i.d. to pick up the box?

    you will need to show ID of person who is receiving the package. if you used fake name they won't give you package without legit ID of that name.

    TOR. The Onion Router. Read about it. It's what you're using right now, unless you're accessing this through onion.to (in which case just.. just go.)
    <br/>
    You should also read about how ridiculous it is to post as "Someone Who Isn't Me" or "M.F.M.Z.P - My Friend's Mother's Zebra's Penis" or other ridiculously inane acronyms.
