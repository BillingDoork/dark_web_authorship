    I recently had a new vendor think it was helpful to refund me after a 3 BTC hash deal never showed after 10 days or so. I told him to wait longer. He said he was in the middle of nowhere. Post was slow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyhow I got a 3% refund stat now not the 0% I had after 30+ packages arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I now find I got a 2 week UK to UK order no here and one from Spain way slow as other UK got there goods off the same vendor a week ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I may have to finalize on two 'no shows' or I will have a 7% refund or something. Only needs a gram of coke not to come and I'd look bad!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So wish buyers could have a stat saying they paid on no shows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plus, I lost BTC of two rip off vendors one who sent rubbish the other at least just sent nothing and vanished.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do not get me wrong - in real life its WAY worse for many.

    Thanks for reading  ;)

    Yep, same kinda thing happened to me too, a very trusted seller (which I also trust) sent me some stuff that wasn't here at the latest auto-finalize time, so I had to finalize early (2 hours early...) just to not get "auto-finalizations 100%" or something on my profile. As a new buyer that would immediately kill my stats (right?)....
    <br/>
    Now I took all the risk because it was an international shipment, but even if I would have gotten a refund, I would have gotten that as a statistic...
    <br/>
    Bit annoying to have these stats but not have them a bit more detailed.

    I have, My stats are squeaky clean I want to keep them that way. Granted I use the same vendors over and over and always FE just because I have built a report with them. But If I ever decide to order a 1000 pills or something I want good stats so I don't have to FE

    You should take no-show's to resolutions.  Don't auto-finalize and hand crooks money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just state your case in your resolution, either if you are willing to give him more time, or that you want a full (or whatever you want) refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you put it into resolution you're by default extending the due date (you're extending it until SR support has finished their investigation) and it shows your legitimacy in the case.

    I would hope nobody does this. I know it sucks to fuck up your buyer stats but as long as you have more than 3 purchases already it really doesn't look so bad to bring one to the resolution center.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My third or fourth order was a no-show, it wasn't difficult to get my stats back where they should be.

    I wouldn't recommend doing this, unless you are sure the vendor is 100% legit and you aren't taking a large loss.  Otherwise, if you are dealing with a scammer, you just perpetuate the problem and set up people down the line to get burned.  If you use resolution, you establish a pattern that SR admin will be able to detect earlier and use to ban scammer accounts.  At the very least write it in your feedback "item never arrived but small order, so auto-finalized to not harm buyer stats"

    Ask for a re-ship, most respectable vendors will do a re-ship. If not take it to resolution. Ask for "extension + re-ship". Honestly one refund isn't going to kill you. Most vendors only pay a lot of attention to refunds if it is international. One refund isn't going to keep a vendor from selling to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The standard refund for no-show is 50%. There was one order I did where the packaging just disappeared (was to australia) and SR admin just did a 50% refund, worked for both of us.

    I just finalised an order that got intercepted by customs. It was a free sample though, so all I had to pay was shipping. Don't mind giving him the 1BTC shipping fee by finalising, as he obviously shipped it!
    <br/>
    Personally, I wouldn't finalise if it was a proper order that didn't show up. As Anarcho said, if it's a scammer you're just helping them out.

    I finalized a domestic order for a few lsd tabs that didn't show up on the understanding that the seller would throw in a gram of his shitty weed (didn't mind that it was shitty as it was just as cheap) with the next order I made, when that time came around he canceled my order and I haven't heard from him since  :o

    From what I've gathered a 5/5 is the ideal rating, and the rest are viewed as "Avoid Seller" ratings? I've seen this a few places, where it's pretty much a binary choice of "Is this seller good" rather than "How good is the seller" . Although the options are given, most users seem to treat it as such.

    I'm a new vendor (well, about to be) and I'm assuming even a 4/5 is something that needs work?

    Buyer rating doesn't matter nearly as much as seller rating.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything below a 5/5 is a "You fucked up"  they are just different degrees of fucking up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would get so angry if someone gave me 4/5 just because they didn't agree with my packaging methods or they didn't like the design on my blotter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is hard as shit to get a 100% rating. I have tried to refund people who have given me a 1/5 but they rated me then stopped going on SR so they won't even reply to my messages offering a refund.

    I don't know why you guys would rather lose money and have no product in exchange for clean stats. If the product doesn't arrive by finalize deadline, extent it by 10 days (through resolution center) or ask for a refund. If the vendor doesn't approve, ask to either re-ship or provide proof of delivery. If that doesn't work, either accept your loss and post bad feedback to seller's page, or get your refund and move on.

    What's the problem with bad buyer stats? Just start up a new buyer account. Yes, you'll have to finalize early a few times, but you'll use the system the way it was meant to be used rather than encouraging bad vendors.
