    So I got a note to go pick up "big letter 1xf (or lxf or 1x1)" can't understand that bullshit handrwriting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously wasn't my name or my adress even. What does this mean, that they opened it and saw what was inside?
    <br/>
    This means I can't send to this adress ever again?

    Does the notice say it requires a signature? If it was seized it doesn't mean your address/po box is flagged, mine wasn't after I got my love letter, but I'd test it out first to be sure.

    It's one of those classic, pre-made post-office small notes that you usually have in the mail when you have a big package that you need to go with your ID card to get.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You may also have to sign, I don't know. Probably not.

    My advice: chill.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't pick the package up, just ignore it, it's a potential write-off. Not worth risking your freedom over one delivery, even if it's high value item.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't worry about the address though, keep using it. Don't buy large amounts, keep using questionable names on the delivery address and the packages will just come in. It worked for me. They're too scared to really do anything about this, it becomes increasingly more obvious as time goes on. The only effective weapon they have left is fear. Don't give in.

    The only thing I am pissed off is that I don't have any MDMA now and no money left. And I was literally looking forward to this since february, when I last rolled.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, I do have MDMA. I had 2 orders to this adress, with the same fake name. One of them came in, juergen's MDMA, which looks like totally crap, covered in what I believe sassafras oil and another unidentified thing, it may be good though, I hope to god it isn't cut with speed or anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm gonna borrow some money and buy some more bitcoins, I was going to buy something like 5 grams. Do you think that's just risking losing the money again? Should I order to a different address?

    Just go pick it up!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you weren't expecting a package full of drugs and you were told you had something at the post office you would go. You should still go. You received that in the mail for you to go pick it up. Based on "your knowledge" you don't know that the package isn't in your name and that it has drugs. If you go to pick up the package and they ask for ID, show them your real ID. If they refuse to give you the package because the package isn't addressed to you (unlikely this will happen), then leave it and go home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Going to pick up a package at the post office because you received the little yellow note means nothing. The package isn't even in your name and therefore you could have a legal defense (or at least a start) that the package was not yours or even marked with your name).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Clean house just as a precaution. But GO GET THAT MDMA!
    <br/>
    :D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll come right back on here and thank me. If you take some first then you'll come back on here and love me!

    You have two choices--forget about it and cut your loss, or go get it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you cut your loss, you're out whatever you paid for the order.  If you go get it, you might get arrested upon signing.  HOWEVER, if you have nothing else on you or your property, and no evidence of Silk Road, then you can simply claim that you didn't know what was in the package, and you weren't expecting anything, etc.  Once you pull that card, and they have nothing else on you, you'll be cleared.  There are dozens of precedents of this exact scenario.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, this is all really unlikely, and more likely you're just being paranoid.  I bet if you go pick up the letter, you'll have absolutely no issues and you'll be happy.

    How can I go get it if it was under a fake name and NOT my adress and they need my ID?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They really do need your ID, at least in my country, to pick up shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And since this was a letter, and not a big package... There's something fishy going on. Usually they don't send notes like these for letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd have to be pretty damn stupid to go get it.. They caught someone I knew at the post office with a package full of shrooms and they arrested him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So basically.... I'm going to go to the post office, with the little note which has the fake name on it. They will ask me for ID. I'll show them my ID. They'll say where's the owner of the letter. I'll say whatever I want, that he's my brother/sister/whatever. They'll either tell me to tell him to come in person.  Because... They're not gonna give a letter to someone that is not the one who's supposed to receive the letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either that, or I'll get arrested. Then they'll ask me who "Mr. Fake Name" is. I can't lie to the police or they'll know. Best I could say is I found that little note in a postbox that ISN'T MINE, and I thought: OH, I could steal that or something but I didn't know it was drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, this fails.
    <br/>
    Best case scenario, I walk away without anything happening and without the letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you realize just how much of a risk I'm taking WTF?

    I received the little notice like that, but it said they checked the box for requiring my signature and the 'sender' of the package (top right corner) was 'Postal Inspector'. Then I got a letter in the mail from the postal inspector saying the package was seized, so be on the lookout for that.

    Well... I'm not from the US, and the little yellow notes are actually little gray notes. And it doesn't say the sender's name or anything.

    It clearly states they need an ID card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People recommended me to go and do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While I don't have the exact adress and name. I have a very similar adress, basically the same apartment building, but just a different apartment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could I just say I'm the guy's neighbour and he will be out of town for a while, and I just wanted to help out so that the letter would not return to sender? (Play the good neighbour card?).
    <br/>
    That's the best explanation I came up with so far. I'm really trying to make a defense for myself in case the police are waiting for me to sign the thing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm 20 years old and got a great life ahead of me, I don't want my future to be ruined because of something as stupid as this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So give me all the advice you can. I'm thinking of first sending a friend to get the letter. So if they were to arrest him, he could just say some guy gave him that note and told him to go get it and there would be some money in for him. He doesn't live in the same apartment building where the letter was supposed to be sent so that would be less suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have read the whole thread on your experience, meister. But I'm interested in knowing if they have anything on me in my current situation.
    <br/>
    It's a bit more complicated than "I didn't know what was in the letter I received" because it would be obvious that I was searching other people's mailboxes, what innocent person would do that? How do I justify picking up a mailbox from another apartment from my building? Why would I do that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But on the other hand, I REALLY want that fucking MDMA.

    First order from juergen arrived at the same adress and under the exact same fake name last thursday.

    Did the post office mention who it was addressed to? If not, then no need to worry. You could turn up and quite plausibly behave surprised when it becomes obvious that it's not addressed to you. If they've already told you it's not addressed to you, then you should have asked who it was addressed to, then refused it as a mistake, being as it is you don't recognize the name.

    If you go through with the previous plan, then yes, that will make it very difficult to suddenly revert to claiming you don't know who  Mr. Fake is. Perhaps if you said: "Hmmm, odd. I have received mail for that name before, but because I didn't recognize the name, I just left it". LE say: "How many letters? When? Where are these letters now?". You say: "Can't remember, a few.  /  Oh, a few months ago. Maybe.  /   I think I threw them a way, I've forgotten to be honest". (i.e. keep it plausibly vague)

    Exactly the same risk you'd be taking with any other drug purchase? What makes this one so different? The punishment will be identical, but only of course if you play right into their hands which is kind of what it sounds like you're after tbh. If not, why be so paranoid?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You don't have to go, the police know nothing, as long as you don't tell them anything. It's that easy. If you do get arrested, you still have a huge amount of power. You can threaten go to the newspapers, or your local parliamentary representative, perhaps a civil liberties organization, and claim that you are being victimized for something that is out of your control. LE may become more conciliatory in the face of such action, as their fear of SR becoming more widely used is driving these episodes more than anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can walk out of a police station without so much as an Official Warning, and this is entirely possible, then you will have taken them on and won. And that's what Silk Road is all about, in my opinion. If all you want is drugs, they're still available from street corners, no Silk Road required.

    Having read your replies since here's my new advice:

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't go. Leave it. Don't send your friends. Leave it. The stop coming on the Silk Road. Period.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can tell by your flighty disposition that you're not built to handle the police. Or the Silk Road. Stop trying for now, perhaps given a bit of time you might realize how much you're overreacting to this situation. Oh, and if you're FUDtrolling ("I am only a little 20 year old with a bright future that shouldn't be ruined over being naughty", lol), then just go home. Cos IF so, you're just as crap as the rest of them. A little more subtle, but crap all the same.

    You obviously can't tell exactly when I'm being sarcastic and when I'm not. Although I'm not actually trying to disguise it.

    <br/>
    If you're for real, then I actually mean it. Don't go. It's highly likely you will end up incriminating yourself if that's how your unrestrained thinking is manifesting itself. This is no doubt insulting to you, but I intend no such thing. I just genuinely believe that you have not got what it takes to have a good chance of walking out of the police station uncharged.

    And I said IF. I even used the capitals when I said it. IF.

    Here's another if: If you were a FUDtroll, you're hardly going to suddenly confess to it when someone calls you, that's one of the first principles of successful trolling dontcha know. So there's not much point in denying it, whether it's true or not.

     Did the post office mention who it was addressed to? If not, then no need to worry. You could turn up and quite plausibly behave surprised when it becomes obvious that it's not addressed to you. If they've already told you it's not addressed to you, then you should have asked who it was addressed to, then refused it as a mistake, being as it is you don't recognize the name.

    Yes. I said it above. On the little gray note I got in the mailbox it says the following things:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mister "fake name"
    <br/>
    Your ......  has arrived. And in the dotted line, someone wrote "big letter 1xf" or something like that.
    <br/>
    You can come to post office number 1 during 7 AM - 8 PM bla bla to retrieve the letter by presenting ID card.

    Cause I'd have to back up my story of housekeeping for my neighbour. But since I don't even know what the guy who owns that apartment looks like, how am I going to back up that story?

    Your original post was much less detailed than what you've just stated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, the note isn't even addressed to you, yet you're saying that *you* received the note? Bad start. You say you found it in "the mailbox", implying a shared mailbox. You're absolutely nuts even considering turning up at the post office to say "Uh.... think you might have my package. Uh, my name? Oh, uh, I meant to say it's my neighbours package... yeah". That plan is hugely flawed, especially if the fake named person doesn't even exist at your building. You run a very high risk of getting arrested behaving like that, assuming this is for real. If you're for real, please don't go. Because like I said, it's obvious to me that you will be an easy nut to crack, as you're seemingly desperate to put yourself at totally unnecessary risk using utterly bizarre stories that will slowly unwind before your eyes, as you yourself have recognized, and all despite having absolutely no need to do so.

    Aight. You're definitely right.

    <br/>
    I was just trying to understand why some people here recommended me to go when I explained that it wasn't my mailbox, and not my name. I was trying to get a plausible story. But as I thought, there isn't any plausible story, and as I have assumed from the start, the package is lost.

    I received a 70% refund, so all is well. I guess this shit happens.

    What I don't know, is, if I can use my neighbour's mailbox for this kind of stuff again. He's never home, he never checks his mail, so his mailbox was perfect for my needs.

    Is it more risky to use my OWN mailbox and my OWN name than a mailbox which isn't mine and a fake name?

    Yes would be my answer. Seeing as the pretense that we all have to maintain is that we are not the senders of "the package", the postbox you send it to is largely irrelevant, as long as you have access of course.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Right now, you are much safer than you are perhaps aware of. For all you know, there could be someone else in your building ordering from the 'Road. Bet you never thought of that? How are LE supposed to be able to tell which of you it was? Perhaps there's someone else using Tor for a totally different purpose. Maybe it's easy for a non-resident ordering from SR to follow tradesmen or residents into your lobby to pick up the package (perhaps not the brightest idea, but the important point is that it's far from completely implausible, you yourself were considering doing something pretty risky just a few hours ago).

    If you can get your story straight, and I mean really, extra resolve-hardened straightness, then there is nothing to stop you using your own mailbox. Even your own name. (perhaps with a minor misspelling or some other ambiguity, just to muddy the evidential waters a little more). If/When LE want to speak to you about what "you've" been up to, say all the right things at the right times, and then go home. It's that easy. It's happened to others on here, and they were neither arrested, nor charged.

    Please listen to me.  DON'T GET THE PACKAGE!  I know how tempting it is to have drugs waiting for you but i promise it is not worth the problems it could cause.  As an neutral third party, I plead with you to not get it.  I dont believe that you have a good enough story/alibi to bail you out of this one.  There has been plenty of people telling you not to do it, but I know your just waiting for that one response that will inspire you enough to get the package.  I'm telling you this outta love brotha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S.- I don't think you are a troll and I don't think you should leave SR.  I think it is just as trolliish to repeatedly tell someone that they might be a troll.

    I am not going to get it. I was pretty sure I wouldn't get it, but then I received some PM's and some people posted in this thread saying that I can get it and avoid getting charged with shit. So I tried to think of ways I could make a good story in case there was LE waiting for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I tried to justify going by thinking that LE wouldn't spend the money and time to do a sting operation on some kid who got a gram of MDMA through the mail. They obviously got bigger fish to fry, so it was probably just the post office that needed a signature. Then, if shit hit the fan, I would have needed a story.... which is a totally different issue because no story I could ever come up with would justify picking up a person's (whom I don't know) mail... So I'm not going. Even though there are quite low chances of anything happening, there is a chance. And it's not worth losing everything because of the little fun I could've had with that MDMA this weekend. There is time for everything I guess.

    If this is an attempt to arrest you, then your local/regional police are taking a gamble on that basis. And the hilarious thing is, if you don't engage with this situation, they will have wasted time and resources on this. This is what we all want.

    Although you appear to think I am somehow going out of my way to insult you, that is not my intention. I am simply taking an assertive approach to forum members that spread fear and disinformation, even if it's inadvertent. You're very unlikely to go to jail for 1 gram of MDMA, especially now you've accepted that attempting to retrieve it is not a sensible plan.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, you are attempting to insult me. You haven't achieved it though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And to be fair, I am somewhat arrogant. Either you like that or you don't, it's not changing any time soon. I will make no apologies for simply being an individual with my own characteristics.

    Yeah, it's that slight superior attitude, i can see it.

    Jail for 1g mdma? Not likely. Criminal record? Yes. And that would keep out of a good job in the future. Which isn't really great.

    I know people with jobs at highly reputable international companies that have very tight security vetting. They disclosed not only "past" drug use (at their employers request during the application process), but also their other previous misdemeanours too (shop lifting in one case, a serious physical assault in another). Passing drugs tests/medical exams is pretty straightforward, drink plenty of water in the run up to the test on a fairly empty stomach, and possibly take creatine supplements the week before (apparently, this levels up the balance of expected natural concentrations of creatine metabolites in urine, drinking loads of water makes those concentrations appear suspiciously low). And it worked for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you end up with a record as long as your arm, then possibly it could affect your prospects. But with criminal charges that happened years and years ago, it's not difficult to rule them out as youthful indiscretion. Everyone's young once, and you do take risks that you wouldn't take when your older.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think you should stop taking drugs, and you should definitely stop buying them from the Silk Road. You're not very well suited to it in a prohibition era, as you're way too self interested. This site is about taking a stand against this prohibition BS. If all you care about is your short term inebriation and your long term job prospects (both views which you have espoused more strongly than any other), then don't be surprised when people like me take a less than sympathetic attitude to you.
    <br/>

    Can this be the last time that I ask you to stop spreading disinformation?

    p.s. it's near enough a direct contradiction to be a respectful narcissist. Do try to avoid saying the equivalent of "true is false, and false is simultaneously true" all in the one sentence.

    If you wondering who negged you, it wasn't me. Do as you would be done by, I say. And I don't really agree with the idea of tarring someone with negativity that cannot ever be removed. I'd prefer to just not give any karma at all to someone who I think is a bit of a tool (I made an exception when I +1'ed you, though)

    And yes, you're quite right, you do seem very insistent on finding out what drugs I enjoy. Go you.

    Dude, first of all..it's only 2 grams of MDMA!! Come on do you think that they're really going to go outta their way to bust you for two grams? If they knew what it was then you would've received a love letter from customs.  Also, the PO is a federal government building, so they wouldn't call the local police.  I'm going to tell you something that someone once told me......just sit down...take a downer, drink a beer, and just CHIIIILLLLLL..

    And the building is not a federal building... My country is not a federation.
    <br/>
    And the drug laws are much harsher here. They will give you a record for possession, maybe even intended trafficking if they catch you with 1g crystal MDMA. Then the cops will beat the shit out of you. If you want to avoid this, and walk out unbeaten and without a record, you will have to rat out your dealer.

    Shipping drugs through the mail is just like shipping anything else. Ifthe vendor is good then you're fine. It is people who do dumbass things that get mail flagged. False names, constantly checking tracking and general suspicious activity aare some of the reasons.

    As long as you liv alone or haven't raised any flags with roommates or the post office before then you will be fine. Order from a top vendor with current positive reviews and you will see that everything is alright.
