    Hi All,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whenever I put in just the PGP encrypted address in the box when I check out, it tells me to put in a valid address.
    <br/>
    What is SR buyer's etiquette regarding this? I put an obviously fake nonexistent address prior to the PGP message. Is this okay?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks,
    <br/>
    <br/>

    I had no issues sending my encrypted address through the checkout. Maybe you are doing something incorrectly.. make sure you have selected a shipping option and updated your cart. Don't see why it wouldn't work for ya.

    Thanks for the reply kolmert. I selected a shipping option and cart was updated. The format that finally worked for me was as follows:

    Shouldn't be too big a deal seeing as it ended up sending through my encrypted address anyway, I just wanna make sure so I can do things right :)

    Did you copy/paste the address (encrypted or not) from Notepad?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If so, make sure the format (in the "save as" menu) is ANSI not UTF-8.  If you save as UTF-8 it inserts a marker (usually invisible) at the beginning of the file. A lot of apps get confused by it.

    That's odd. Maybe it has something to do with the character encoding or the newline character you're using.

    I copy-pasted the non encrypted address into the GPG clipboard, then encrypted it.

    Interesting and useful point, although it is pre set to ANSI and not UTF-8.

    Very strange... I'm assuming your PGP message was ASCII armored, since the output included that "----- BEGIN PGP MESSAGE -----" and "END" enclosure?  Or did you actually add that yourself?

    I didn't add it myself, it was added automatically when I encrypted the address using GPG4win.

    Yeah, that means it was ASCII armored.  I'm stumped, frankly.

    It's conceivable that the message was so short (because the vendor's encryption key is so short) that it didn't pass the basic "more than one or two lines of text" check.  I do recall something somewhere or other about a check for that... but now I can't for the life of me remember where I ran into that information.  Anyway, that's really the only thing I can think of.
