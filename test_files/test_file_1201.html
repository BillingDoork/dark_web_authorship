    sorry to raise this topic maybe again but i want to be nearly sure about how to proceed:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    wanted to seal my goodies in MBB, put inside some metal case and in checked lugagge. now i ve heard from someone working at airport security before that checked luggage is no good idea since airport security will check with x-ray, see everything (recognizing there is something in the metal case which does not belong there) and may open it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    better choice he suggested was to put it below balls.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now my question is: when i seal them in MBB or plain static shield (ESD) bags will the metal detector signal them?

    Dunno, mate, but you could always just mail the item(s) in question on ahead of you to your hotel so it's there when you check in; or wherever else it is you're going to be getting some shut eye whilst on this walkabout of yours.

    Airport metal detectors won't pick up on MBBs because they're not dense enough, that's why the detectors don't hit on small metal belt buckles and small pieces of jewelry etc because they set the sensitivity only low enough to hit on larger/more dense metal objects like weapons and knives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But as SS said, if you don't want the worry, just mail it to your destination.
