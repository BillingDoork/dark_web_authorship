    I recently tried to buy a bong from the US -&gt; New Zealand and it was seized in transit (byebye $500), but i was wondering if i would still be able to use the same address for my silk road purchases? Or would they flag the address?

    Hey Horror,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is definitely an interesting question. Why was the package seized to begin with? Assuming that because of the fact that you purchased it online to be shipped across the world, the senders would send it clean and unused. I am not familiar with the laws in New Zealand but would have a hard time believing that was illegal.

    In regards to answering your question, better safe than sorry is ALWAYS the advice we give here on SR. There are many very easy ways to obtain other places to ship your things, just be creative or buy a PO Box :)

    It's illegal to import any paraphernalia, but ive had glass pipes come in unmolested, guess the bong was too obvious haha.  I guess ill have to go and sort a p.o box out, thanks for the advice.

    I really nice bong will cost that much in the US. There are even better ones with glycerin tubes that you can detach and put into a freezer to cool down smoke that are a 1000 or more.

    Your address is flagged now. I would give it some time, maybe a couple months before trying to order something else. or maybe use a different address next time.

    I'd suspect scam long before I'd believe an unused anything was seized. I'd certainly be all over the seller for a full refund. There's no excuse for sending something legal in a way that attracts so much heat it gets seized. Did they label it a "large marijuana smoking pipe" or something?

    I don't think there's any way to know for certain if your address will be flagged after a Customs seizure of this type.  However, you can be sure that if they wanted to they can flag it... so it seems prudent to drop that one.

    It's from a reputable paraphernalia site, I highly doubt that they would try to scam me. It states on their site they they will not be held accountable for seizures, so im SOL. It also says on the site that they send the bongs in discreet boxes so I don't think that it had any part in the seizure of my bong.

    Oz has the same issues with importing drug paraphernalia might i suggest next time ask them to send it pulled apart... i was looking at importing a bong a while ago with the safest method having the stem and cone sent separately to the bong itself... thats how the shops over here are getting away with still selling them on the shelf

    It's hard to disguise a bong as something else, especially a large one, but if they're a strictly legit company they likely as not declared it honestly on the customs declaration and that's why it was seized. Sending the components separately can help, and for large bongs add a lamp fitting to the box and declare it as a light :)
