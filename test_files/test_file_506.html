    Hi All,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I am new and I am taking a domestic flight in the coming weeks and I am looking at taking around 1g of coke and 5 MDMA pills with me.  My thought was since I am on several prescriptions which include a benzo (Valium) it would be in my best interest to buy some empty capsules to put the coke in, then proceed to just buy MDMA that looks similar to one of the medications I currently take and put it all in one bottle.  I was then going to put everything in a checked bag (I figure less attention might be paid to it.)  Unfortunately shipping will not be an option to my destination.  Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  I have used the search function and have seen a few threads that kind of fizzled out on the topic.

    I should add that I am thinking of a little bit of meth as well using the same method.  I can subtract and will subtract anything that obviously would be riskier than another.  I don't even know if Meth can be sniffed out by dogs..  forgive my newbieness.

    Thanks!

    I think you will be fine with those methods.  Done it that way before.  Checked the baggage though.  Just mix the capsules with other ones that looks similar and put it with your normal things.  Don't try and stash the bottle in some secret pocket, etc.  Make it all look normal.

    No experience with US flights, but I have carried drugs (mainly weed, but also others) regularly on flights for many years (intra-EU and international to countries with notoriously strict customs). My 2 cents on the subject are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Always keep the dope on you - you may be right that checked-in luggage attracts less attention, but unless you know that for a fact dont assume it. With all the time they keep the check-in luggage they could easily open every single bag, check every single item, and re-package it as it was, without you or i ever being the wiser. I always keep it in either carry-on luggage or a jacket that gets put through the x-ray machine (never on me at all times, in case i get searched after a metal-detector test)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Dont go crazy with physical concealment - as long as you are carrying personal use amounts (as in your case and in mine) chances of it appearing on an x-ray machine or pretty much nil, and same with a random check. What you're planning to do with the coke is way more stealthy than anything i've ever done
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - The biggest problem is sniffer dogs, and no concealment will save you from those, though I'm unsure how sensitive they are... i past by some dogs who were hidden round a corner in germany with a small amount of H and they didnt stop me. On another occasion i was stopped even though i hadnt any dope on me, just by catching the smell from smoking weed the night before, so its variable... i suggest though you wear some clean clothes (i.e. not the clothes in which you were smoking dope all night)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Also, because of the dogs, I suggest to keep dope always at-hand, so you can *inconspicuously* throw it in a trash can before passing by them (i.e. without having to unpack half your luggage). this is not always possible (sometimes the dogs are well hidden, as was the case in germany where i frankly got lucky), but as last-ditch resort can be necessary... if you're travelling with someone who is aware of what you're carrying they should go in front and act as a spotter for any dogs, but this is best-case scenario...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    bottom line is that customs are after traffickers, not people who carry their own stash, and they are trained &amp; equipped to confront traffickers, not users, so there is a very high chance you will be fine... good luck and stay safe
    <br/>

    I would advise against keeping your stash on your person while traveling through the airport. Biggest reason here is just not having the ability to deny knowledge of the drugs. As for my suggestion on how to do it, I think investing in a vac sealer and taping it to the inside of your deodorant. Put your deodorant inside a plastic bag to avoid it melting onto your clothes. Just my .02 on the matter. I hope you arrive safely and have a great time.

    for a small amount like that a vac seal and stashing in the checked baggage is def the way to go, even something as simple as sticking in a pants pocket before you pack them. They are looking for bombs, not some dudes party stash.

    Agree.  Vac seal, checked bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also,  dress to blend in.  Don't wear your rasta clothes that day. ;)

    Thanks for the great advice everyone.  I think the MDMA will go in pill bottles since it is 5 pills and everything else will be vac sealed.  I am a guy who has always dressed kind of preppy with a hat on so I don't think I would fit the profile of someone they would think would use any drugs.  I know I will not be carrying anything on my persons because the airport I fly out of has body scanners.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I look forward to a great trip.. thanks again for all the advice!

    I'd suggest vac seal/multiple plastic bags for your shit, and then put that inside a shampoo bottle inside your checked bag. Its worked for me multiple times, but it seems you already have a plan that will work.
