    Hey everyone. I've read a good amount so far and am confident I'd make a great vendor but I've got some questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Is it safe to use the USPS' "Click-N-Ship" to pre pay packages and drop them off at the blue box? https://cns.usps.com/go
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. What are going to be the three best bang for the buck box type to go with for sending 2g, 5g and 10g amounts of bud? I read this postal worker's thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165838.0 and they recommend the Tyvek envelope. Would that be the best for all three, lined with paper?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. From this thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0 which of these three performs the best: moisture barrier bags, mylar bags or heat seal foil bags? If they all perform the same, which have you guys found to be the cheapest?

    1) No. Easily trackable. Unless you can find a way to pay it without having a card that's linked to your name, or your IP address. Far too much work in my opinion since most prepaid cards make you register with your SSN now. Get packages, a mail scale, label printer, stamps, and priority stickers(if you want to send priority). Priority stickers and tracking labels can be obtained on the USPS website and Stamps.com for free. Though when ordering the tracking labels I would advise having them sent to an address that cannot be tracked back to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2 &amp; 3) I do not know what Tyvek Envelopes are, but I would suggest heat-sealing your weed in MBB, and then including some degree of stealth in your package so it is not immediately spotted if the package accidentally comes opened. Or at least made so it doesn't feel like nugs in the MBB. You will need a heat-sealer to close these bags. These bags are extremely effective from my experience. I have seen HPs-LBs of weed come over the Canadian border into the US multiple timse in only one of these bags with no other layers of protection. It was just the weed dumped straight into the MBB and sealed. Of course you're going to want to wipe down your packages with alcohol to clean off finger prints and residue before you send it out. Domestic packages rarely get intercepted/sniffed out so at the very least, if you want to be lazy, you just need to make sure your package doesn't stink(use MBB). Customers will always appreciate the additional stealth.

    How do most people do that? I have a company name and a PO Box at a mom and pop shipping store, however the company name is definitely traceable to me by law enforcement (but not by would-be customers).

    Anyone have any ideas? I'm thinking because it's something as innocuous as tracking labels I may be able to have delivered to a friend. But I assume the tracking label has my return address though so it would be traceable anyway. What do most vendors put as a return address? It seems like there's no way to have a legitimate one without it being able to be traced back to you.

    This my friend is the great debate that is still going on. No one has yet to come up with a fool proof solution. IF scammers were not a threat this wouldn't be a problem. All packages could be sent without a tracking.

    Seems like a catch 22. Trusted buyers don't need  to buy from a new seller, and trusted sellers won't sell to potential scammers and idiots. Unless of course they have the luxury of a PO Box with a fake photo ID's name and they can demand FE because of their rep. Looks like I need to do some work before starting this thing...

    That thread about using somebody's random mailbox is what made me worrisome. If the buyer fucks up and the person whose mailbox it is gets the package and reports it to the cops the vendor could get seriously screwed.

    Well idk about being screwed..I mean if it was like a gram of weed in the package LE prolly be like w/e..however if it was say 5grams of H or MDMA u bet your ass that they'll be watching for packages that ship out of your area and to to triangulate your position. On your vendor page it's best to state all your policies such as the example you just gave...no fake addresses, no fake names, mailbox must belong to you so on and so on whatever your policies are. I think the more defined and clear your policies are then it serves and protects you better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The more I think of it and all the necessary steps I have to take and precautions and backup plans for precautions I'm starting to think getting a regular job would be more easier, lol.. If I put as much thought into my freelance business as I have on making a plan to be a SR vendor I'd be doing ok by now I think. Being a vendor is not a light undertaking and I think a lot of people underestimate the responsiblities to be one. You have both your life and the buyers life on the line and it all comes down to your actions but I'm glad that you're thinking about all these things. I'm not trying to discourage you at all I just think the more prepared you are and the more thorough about every detail the better you are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other things you want to consider are:
    <br/>
    1) How will you launder your money?
    <br/>
    2) If launder them through a shell business will you pay taxes on them?
    <br/>
    3) If things go south do you have a contingency plan(fake documents/passports) to leave the country?
    <br/>
    4)Is your computer clean from viruses and spyware?
    <br/>
    5) Network secure?
    <br/>
    6)Are you a normal person in r/l that you can lead a double life as a seller? Cause people with money and no jobs raise questions
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Those are just a few questions that come to mind. I know some ppl might think that's being overly paranoid but the fuck I care. I'd rather be that then in jail and all my family and friends shamed :P

    Haha well I just see it as more clientele, you need to have all your ends tied up though. Someone in another thread just recommended using random local businesses which may be the answer I'm looking for. The problem is getting established I guess, obviously there are people doing this right and making bank so if they can do it we can. Anyway does anyone actually buy a gram at a time? I'm thinking of doing 2g, 5g, 7g, and 10g listings. I originally was going to do 2g, 3.5g, 7g and 14g but nothing over 13 oz can be put in a blue drop box and I think 2/5/7/10 are displaced pretty good. Maybe 2/4/8/10 would be better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as those questions go I think I've got it covered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1-2) Moneypaks
    <br/>
    3) I'd really like it to not get to that point, scary to consider that shit.
    <br/>
    4) I'll partition my hard drive and install a linux distro and use tails OS within that partition (hope that works, I haven't taken the time to try it out yet)
    <br/>
    5) I plan on getting an offshore VPN with bitcoin, also haven't looked into that. More focused on the shipping logistics right now.
    <br/>
    6) I think so. What type of living situation do you think is ideal for a vendor? Rural or urban? Home/apartment/loft/etc? Is being further away or closer to your drop box(es) ideal? Should you only use ones in the most populated city in your area?

    Wow I'm an idiot. 13 oz not grams... is it apparent that I wash dishes and sell weed for a living. Before you call me out I eyeball my shit, the way my papa taught me lol.

    That seems pretty ok and standard but watch out on that Moneypak those can come back and fuck you in the ass. Every Moneypak has a serial number on it which can be traced and followed which to me just seeks sketchy vendors accepting Moneypaks for Bitcoins. I mean come on seriously if I was LE I'd buy Bitcoins with a Moneypak and followed the trail of that Moneypak. The smarter vendors will send that Moneypak through through different routes but I still don't see how that will hide it. For example if I take the MP &gt; Paypal &gt; Bank Account..no good. MP to my local BestBuy for flat screen ..still no good. MP to another debit card and another then to some other account is a little better. I'm sure some Bitcoin vendors just take the Moneypak and start spending it...great if that buyer was LE he knows what area your in know. Out of the whole vending thing cashing out to me seems to be the most important step where you need a plan and it's getting harder and harder to cash out bitcoins. Sure you can go on local bitcoins and sell them there but idk about you but I sure as hell don't want to meet a stranger to sell my bitcoins not knowing if I'm under investigation and just being set up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All my paranoid bullshit aside though there are some legitimate ways to cash out your bitcoins if you think creatively  :P You know you can buy more than just drugs with bitcoins riiiiiggghhht? 8)

    Interesting I didn't know all of that. Moneypak does sound pretty risky unless you have access to fake accounts and addresses or cards. Luckily most if not all supplies are on the SR so it's easy to funnel profits back into vending at the beginning. I didn't know about local bitcoin, there's no big buyers in my area anyway but that may be nice for some extra cash every now and then. Can you fathom a scenario that would get you arrested if you were to contact someone on local bitcoin? It's not illegal, but I guess exposing your btc address to an LE sting might cause problems? To be completely honest I've never used bitcoin and this is my first day using Tor/SR/SRf so I'm just learning as I go.

    One thing about shipping:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't use a fake return address. If a package can't be delivered and can't be returned it will end up at a Mail Recovery Center. They'll open it - postal workers at Mail Recovery Centers are the only people authorized to open even first class mail without a warrant - to see if they can find any information on the inside that might help get it delivered, which might not be the best thing for you. Ideally you'd get a return address that's not connected with you but which you'd have some amount of access to.

    It's much better to vend from a large city. If you live in a town with 2000 people it's hard to mail things inconspicuously &amp; it's too easy for an investigation to trace things back to you just from looking at the zip code you're shipping from. Living closer to your drops will make things easier &amp; help you keep a lower profile. Otherwise you'll need a story to explain why you're driving 20 miles out of down just to mail your packages each week.

    Before you start vending try buying on the Road first! It will help you comfortable with Bitcoin &amp; you'll be able to see how other vendors deal with shipping &amp; tracking etc. And if you haven't already try selling a few things on eBay just to get used to the whole online sales/mail order thing. There's no need to rush into vending right away. SR will be around for a long time to come. :)

     It's much better to vend from a large city. If you live in a town with 2000 people it's hard to mail things inconspicuously &amp; it's too easy for an investigation to trace things back to you just from looking at the zip code you're shipping from. Living closer to your drops will make things easier &amp; help you keep a lower profile. Otherwise you'll need a story to explain why you're driving 20 miles out of down just to mail your packages each week.

    That's only if you have a connection to the return address I assume. Or in the case you're pulled over and searched I guess.

     Before you start vending try buying on the Road first! It will help you comfortable with Bitcoin &amp; you'll be able to see how other vendors deal with shipping &amp; tracking etc. And if you haven't already try selling a few things on eBay just to get used to the whole online sales/mail order thing. There's no need to rush into vending right away. SR will be around for a long time to come. :)

    I plan on it, I'm mostly curious about what people use for stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have two more questions if anyone is willing to answer them that would be amazing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) How do you get prepaid labels anonymously?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) How do you drop off boxes without getting your fingerprints on them?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, should I have any fear with discussing all this through a pirated copy of Mac OS X / Windows? I'm going to use a linux partition with tails OS and a VPN but I just haven't got around to doing it yet. I'm using Tor of course.

    1) They are not going to track you down and triangulate your packages from your zip code if you're sending out grams of MDMA or another substance. Think about that. Think about how much work that would require. Now consider all of the people who send out POUNDS on a DAILY basis. I know people on the road who have been doing it for months and they go into the post office for every package because they simply can't fit it in the blue box. People get way too paranoid over these very unlikely 'possible' scenarios that would require rediculous manpower and effort to pull off, that no feds are going to do for a few grams, if they're not going to do it for a few LBs. While it is good to be prepared for these scenarios, take basic precautions and you will be fine. If they want to bust somebody for a few grams of molly or h they can just go to the streets for 1/100th of the effort. The effort that is required to bust somebody by triangulating their packages in their zip-code and what not is far too much with not enough guarantee that it will yield any bust at all, in other words, a huge waste of time, money, and manpower.

    Very few people have the money or the resources to do this, it is often a fanciful idea, even for some very rich drug dealers. You get pinched, do the time. Don't break a law you're not willing to do time for. It's better to just not get caught in general. Know the possible ways they might catch you and make it so those things are impossible. For instance: Don't get substances or shipping supplies in an area that they might be able to easily locate or think to look. Store them in a rented house somewhere, or buy a dedicated car/van that you can package out of the back of and store in some parking lot somewhere where it wont get broken into, etc. Don't receive packages at the house where you have vending supplies or other drugs. Never sign for packages unless you absolutely trust your vendors stealth. I've signed for over 40 international 1-2lb cannabis packages because I know my vendors stealth is legit as fuck.

    While this is a slightd concern, unless you are an active person of interest being investigated for something other than vending on SR, then you don't really need to worry. I personally think this is an overhyped concern. Having lots of money/cash is not going to spark an investigation into you, nor is it probable cause for an investigation. It isn't going to make some cop following you around and stalk you. If a cop is seeing you with vast quantities of cash on a regular basis like that then you have bigger issues and need to use more common sense with handling your money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now adays it is VERY easy to come up with business fronts. There are so many online professions where you can work out of your house and make close to a million dollars a year and few people will question you, things such as a Graphic Designer, Private software developer for private companies(contractual silence ;)), Online marketer, website designer, Music Producer, etc. Few people are going to question these things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Me personally, I don't let people get too close to my personal life if I don't want them knowing about my drug stuff..... my policy is that if I have to lie about my income to somebody on a regular basis then they shouldn't be in my life, or they are stepping over their bounds. There is nothing wrong with being a private person. Just don't go running your mouth and develop a backstory. I know a lot of people who have been in the drug game for years and live in very nice upscale all white neighborhoods with very developed fronts for working online/from home. Nobody suspects a thing. Just have your shit together.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Long story short, if you're doing anything illegal for income or a living, then you have to think about it constantly and make sure it is airtight and solid, at least if you want to last.

    @phat69 don't you need two forms of ID to open a bank account? It seems like it would be a lot safer just buying shit with bitcoins but I don't know.

    Exactly the kind of things a potential vendor should be thinking about and I can't argue with any of that advice. True on all fronts. You know you're ready when you can ask any what if question and you have an answer. That's my take on it but I'm what you say the more paranoid type...I'm sure the meth has something to do with it but w..e lol

    If you're in the US you generally need an SSN that matches your (two forms) of ID. Not impossible, but not as easy as an SR purchase.
