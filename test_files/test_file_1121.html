    Hey guys, so my friend just got an MDMA package from a vendor with whom he's done business before.  It arrived in good time, but was only half of the weight that was ordered.  First issue in 10+ orders so just not sure what the best approach to resolving is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would vendors generally prefer a buyer to submit an extension to the resolution center with a "comments" section explaining the situation or a private message on SR?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He was thinking that the vendor may have split it into two equal packages, but wouldn't it be against SR rules (or at least etiquette) to do this without notifying the buyer ahead of time?  Also, if the address used is no longer available, would it be too much to ask this vendor to wait to send the rest until new arrangements are made?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks, and best of luck to everyone!

    Ask if it's sent in two packages, if not ask for 50% refund or reship of the following 5g!

    I just had the exact same complaint from a customer that started of nicely
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "hi os you forgot 2 gram of methylone i don't think you did it on purpose"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But then the tone changed "if you don't give me the 2 grams i will go in resolution, get my money back, give you a bad rating, lose me as a customer"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The F? You can just ask me nicely, vendors don't bite, so no need for threats, it makes you look nicer if you just wait with the threats  ;D

    I would say to send the vendor a private message! It may just be a mistake... especially if all the other orders have been correct! Let them know and they will probably be able to sort it without any need to involve SR resolution!

    As mention above, send the seller a PM. Explain the problem with the order, 99% of the time the seller will work something out to where the buyer is satisfied.
