    Ok this is my first post yet id been an avid reader and user of the road.A couple months after using the road I had an order put in and was waiting on delivery, I had received a love letter saying they had seized 4 grams of K which was not anything I had ordered. A couples days after receiving the letter it made me skeptic if my current order would show up but to my amazement it did.I have continued to order and have not had a problem or gotten any other letters. Has this happen to anyone else? Has anyone else ever receive a love letter for something they didn't even order?

    Unusual. Did the vendor you ordered from offer K for sale?
    <br/>
    There might have been a mix up on his end which resulted in an order being dispatched to the incorrect address.
    <br/>
    If that is the case, it's a pretty poor show.

    Seems a little silly to continue ordering to the same address after you get a letter from customs.

    This is the third thread I've read about receiving a love letter for K. The other two threads were similar because they either a) didn't order any K or b) ordered a smaller amount of K than was listed on the love letter. I'll try to find those other two threads and modify my post.

    Very strange though...

    Edit: Here are the two other threads:

    No the vendor that I ordered from didn't offer K and I had never ordered K before that I was very confused about the whole specially when I had something on the way completely different. I have never had any other problems or letters from anything I've actually ordered either specially because its always personal amounts. I still wonder if the package would have been deliver how happy I would have been haha 4 free g's of K yummm

    That is very strange indeed. But yeah, that definitely would've been awesome to receive four free grams of K!Â  ;)

    P.S. I added those threads to my last post if you want to check them out.
