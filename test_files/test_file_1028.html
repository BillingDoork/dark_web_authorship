    Just a warning letting everyone know that all packages passing through Memphis TN appear to be being delayed and thoroughly checked for the possibility that they might contain Ricin after the attacks on President Obama. Any o/s orders passing through mail sorting facilities in Memphis are at HIGH RISK of being seized ATM, including orders sent both through regular mail and private courier, and this even appears to include orders that are packaged with MBB bags.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay safe guys.

    Missing orders from a trusted vendor with perfect stealth, as well as delayed legitimate items. A call to the courier company my legitimate items were with confirmed that mail had been delayed after the Ricin attacks.

    Great news, sadly I can't say the same for several orders of mine, although they haven't been confirmed seized yet, they are later than they have ever been :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *fingers crossed*

    Remember, my friends was in a simple envelope with no bulk. I'm now concerned about bigger packages. If your order was in customs for more than 3 -7 days, start cleaning house! (7 day mark, NOT GOOD!) Can you check the tracking? Keep me updated, please. We're in the same boat now*** PM me if you want to talk more quietly w/PGP

    I had something come through their sorting facility as well (Just some pills) and it did take 1 xtra day longer than ETA it came through safe and sound nothing was fucked with..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope you other 2 members or anyone else having anything come through there dont loose anything of any big amounts, or hell anything at all, suks to loose drugs period. Im surprised my whole time on SR and all my order all have come through and never had a issue until last week for the first time i was contacted by resolution about a certain vendor, Told them i was just gona xtend the days to 4 because she promised to reship priority and pretty much triple my order, it all worked out...

    <br/>
    Good luck guys
