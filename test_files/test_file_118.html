    So I grow weed and at any given time will have 5-20 plants in my house and I am a small time dealer so anywhere from $1000-$10000 worth of chems I really dont want police busting in my house. I am wondering if I was to order larger amounts to a PO registered to me that would normally be enough for police to get a search warrant to my house would they still get the warrant to my house if I use a PO box?Â  What about if I opened the box with fake info would they not be able to get a warrant strait away since they dont have my info?
    <br/>
    I live in Canada and sorry if I did a bad job explaining.

    If you open a box with fake info and never get caught in a controlled delivery, you should be safe. As far as opening it in your own name... I think you would still need to get caught in a controlled delivery before your home was directly at risk.
