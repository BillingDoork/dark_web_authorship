    This goes out to all the scammers and government dickheads who think they can disrupt us:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Order tracking labels online to your real name and address.
    <br/>
    2. Slap one on an empty envelope addressed to the same town as your real package.
    <br/>
    3. Drop em at the same time.
    <br/>
    4. If some whiny bitch buyer complains about his package show the tracking info to the admins.
    <br/>
    5. Jack off and laugh at the same time, its harder than it looks.
    <br/>
    6. Enjoy fucking over the bullshit system that is online drug running.
    <br/>
    7. Why are you still reading this faggot, do it, do it now.
    <br/>
    8. You are still reading this.
    <br/>
    9. I bet you like chimp dicks.
    <br/>
    3. So what i changed the numbers.
    <br/>
    7. I just pleasured myself to an 8yr camwhoring. She used a sharpie.
    <br/>
    4. I also got a video of this 10yr boy railing this older girl for 20 minutes straight, he came buckets.
    <br/>
    3. Did that make you sick? Thats what you get for not taking my advice.
    <br/>
    9. Did that turn you on? Then hop over to OPVA!
    <br/>
    5. No really, do it now, we need more material, faggots are still uploading shit from the 70's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    edit: also fuck you.

    This isn't a very good idea. Checking tracking from a public wifi is very easy - vendors having their IP identified when they check the tracking is easily circumventable. The thing vendors worry about is that all tracking numbers can most likely be traced back to the batch they came from, and since only so few companies distribute tracking labels, it would not be terribly hard for any LE to find out which individual ordered specific labels. Though we all know, most LE is lazy and it's the past has shown large complix coordinated efforts are not easily performed by them, though it can happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Though this is mostly speculation that has floated around, the thing about tracking labels being traceable. If this idea is true then it wouldn't matter if the tracking is checked or not. Once they package is arrived the LE could look at the label number and make a few phone calls to find out who ordered it.
