    I think handwriting and stamps.com are out of the question for obvious reasons. What do you guys think are the best ways to label the package??

    I'm not a vendor but the ones to me that look the most like 'regular' mail is when it is a computer printed label affixed neatly and squarely to the box. Ditto for the return address. There are some neat return address labels out there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second would be printed on paper and taped to the box, but that doesn't look as good imho as ^^.

    <br/>
    Least liked would be handwritten, especially individual to individual (I believe that's one of the many flags).

    Do not hand write. Just the other day I was hanging out at a friends house and the mailman misread the address and put in our mail box an express package that had 25 pills in it. It was meant to go to the neighbhor but the handwriting was sloppy. Being kind, we put it back in their mailbox.... but still... it's a lesson, do not handwrite your mail, it makes it stand out so much.
