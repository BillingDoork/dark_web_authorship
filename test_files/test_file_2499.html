    I've read up on the forum topics and the buyer's guides, but I have a question I haven't found an answer for. I found another thread but the responses didn't answer the question. I live in an apartment complex that makes residents sign for every package received in a log, along with presenting photo ID to pick up the package from a mailroom. Any packages that don't fit in a small letter sized box (our mailboxes hold envelopes and small packages, like about the size that a box of checks would come in) go to the mailroom to be picked up. If I want to buy small quantities (like 3.5g of weed), am I safe to have them shipped here, or should I get a PO box or find some other kind of solution? I don't know if having my signature on a package log would be enough to make a controlled delivery. Thanks and sorry if the answer is out there and I wasn't able to find it.

    No one probably knows an exact answer. My GUESS, and please keep in mind that this is just my logic on the situation. That log is probably in place so no one's packages are picked up by their cousins ( if ya know what I mean ) I would order some legal stuff from the countries that you could most likely source uranium and the maybe a small domestic package in the mix or something to that effect. Good luck.

    Thanks. I'm sure that's the point of the package log, my concern is just that if a package were intercepted or w/e that the police could use my signature on the log as proof the same way they would in a controlled delivery. Am I right to be concerned?

    <br/>
    Or am I overthinking this to begin with - would most packages fit in a small mailbox anyway?

    I've had the big express flat rates shoved full of shit in one if those vertical vertical mailboxes. It would probably be someone in the office that you did not recognize as an employee land if not they wouldn't be far. If they were to going to to those lengths to go after an eighth would be enough comfort for me in that with situation.
