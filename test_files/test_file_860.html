    Well I finally have that amazing connect in South America for cocaine and I have set up shop here in the U.S. so I'm ready to vend on the road. I have gotten a few samples from this person and he is allowing me to stay in escrow so I'm pretty fuckin happy.  We are both stuck in one problem. With our deal he needs to get me 40kilos. How in the fuck do we smuggle that here? You can't ship something like that can you? Someone help me on shipping this. Any advice will help. Both I and the seller have shipped many parcels before, but non of this weight. Also it really doesn't make sense economically to split it up.

    Dude I only got access from messaging SR vendors for large amount at a cheap price. If you knew how much I was paying for the 40 kilos... Well it's not much.

    I am new at such large amounts.

    Well like fred said, if someone has access to that amount I could imagine they'd have specific ways of importation. The price you pay for 40 kilos depends on how you import it. You realise once it's in USA or whatever destination country the price nearly doubles? Successfully import that much you'd be retiring early.

    I was actually going to write a similar thread, lesser amount, different drug. Was looking at picking a kilo of MDMA up from Germany to UK without using the post. Things like this take planning.

    I understand they take planning, but I am truly at a loss here.  He was telling me about using a boat for transporting and I really think that's a bad idea, but then again I don't really know anything about smuggling large amounts of anything.
    <br/>
    And double, yea right. For the price I am paying I can sell keys for 6 times more than what I paid and it will be the cheapest out there.
    <br/>
    And all I have to do is put a gram listing at 55$ a peice and on SR that shit will fly.
    <br/>
    I have gotten enough samples and this vendor has a high enough rating that I know I am not going to be scammed. Also the fact that I'm staying in escrow.

    It's not like there is only one method.  But a legit mover... the last thing he would want is someone describing his smuggling method here.

    I have a few ideas that are sound... Am I getting cut of the action? If I'm not, think I'll save my ideas for myself to possibly use someday.  You will need to pay for help/things in other aspects as well...

    1. Its controlled by the cartels
    <br/>
    2. The "farmer" would have to be about 1000 farmers ... Have you ever seen the work that goes into making cocaine ? There is videos on Youtube .. its alot of manual labor
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have the capability to create 40kg, you already have a buyer for it.

    If you cannot work out how to import it yourself, and need others peoples advice, DO NOT IMPORT COCAINE!!
    <br/>
    Anyone that imports bulk amount of drugs needs to have a very well laid out plan, which has plans for all possible solutions.
    <br/>
    What do you do if it gets checked? What do you do it the seller never sent it. You, as the buyer need to know exactly what is going on, and the fact that you need help to import 40kg cocaine shows you do not have the intelligence (yet) to do this. Take my advice and stay away from this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SR is not a place where you should be importing kilograms of cocaine. SR is somewhere that you buy drugs for personal consumption, or small-scale dealing. NOT mass importation of drugs.
    <br/>
    People need to understand that high-end drug suppliers have very sophisticated plans. They don't simply just"order" 40kg cocaine and then work out how to get it in the country. if it were this easy, there would be alot more people doing it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have you thought about that it might also be a scam?
    <br/>
    Remaining in escrow doesn't mean scams don't happen..
    <br/>
    lets say you are paying $10,000 / kilo X 40kg. $400,000. The seller never sends it and they offer you a very generous refund of 90%. That's $40,000 they would have stolen from you still.

    <br/>
    Get creative. Think. Nobody is going to feed you this information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Large-scale drug suppliers are very smart - You clearly are not if you have to ask questions like this. You will just get ripped off. And despite how good of a "friend" they may be, that could mean nothing to them. Use, or be used. Do you really want to learn that the hard way?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to be a drug dealer, start off small and work from there. if you try and skip the steps in between, you will end up losing major amounts of money, or in jail.

      Well like fred said, if someone has access to that amount I could imagine they'd have specific ways of importation. The price you pay for 40 kilos depends on how you import it. You realise once it's in USA or whatever destination country the price nearly doubles? Successfully import that much you'd be retiring early.

      I was actually going to write a similar thread, lesser amount, different drug. Was looking at picking a kilo of MDMA up from Germany to UK without using the post. Things like this take planning.

    But don't go with 5 men in your car smelling of weed and giggling like fuck when handing over your passports or they'll call the sniffer dogs out. Go with family on a weekend trip, or look for UK tours of Paris, Berlin etc easy enough to take it on them coaches without much risk to yourself even if it is caught.

    I call troll.... but if you are being serious I'll give you some advice...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Quit while you're ahead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you really believe what you're being told, you're going to end up broke, dead or both.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Besides the near certainty that your "South American Friend" is planning to take advantage of you, you clearly don't have any idea how to take on a job like this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your best bet is to connect with a professional smuggler and expect to give them 20% of your product as payment. Even then, I'm sure within 30 seconds of meeting you he's going to realize that you're an amateur and you'll end up losing 100% of your product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Harsh words, but fair words.

    I hope it all works out for you.

    Hes got you wrapped around your finger and you are most likely to get scammed. You have no idea if he has this amount, or will ship it to you.
    <br/>
    You have come on the forums asking for help and seem to be ignoring everyones advice. If it was so simple to bring 40 keys over everyone would be doing it. No one is going to take you seriously now, so why will he? Honestlyl if your for real just leave it, its not going to end good and you have more money than sense. Most importantly, your life is worth more than 40 keys, your not george jung.

    You do not go through a farmer to buy 40kgs of cocaine, you go through a cartel who would kill you and the farmer if they even got a whiff of your fictitious coke deal that only exists in your head anyway and well now on the forums too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know why I'm even bothering to post this but here goes...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The cartels have all the trafficking routes locked down, you may have noticed a small civil war in Mexico? yes the one were thousands of people are being chopped up, mutilated, decapitated etc, well that's all to do with cocaine trafficking routes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The very thought your mate down in good old South America can flick you 40kgs is so laughable its not funny.

    If everything works out correctly, I will be selling Uncut cocaine on the road cheaper than anyone else. If not then I guess Im fucked so I start over. The benefit might just outweigh the risk if I do it right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also everyone saying im trolling, seriously who gives a fuck? Does it piss you all off that bad? Why am I wrong for just posting a question.
    <br/>
    What the fuck does anyone gain out of calling me a troll? There are two options:
    <br/>
    1. Respond to the thread and try and answer the question, who gives a shit if you believe the circumstance or not.
    <br/>
    2. Say to yourself I am not wasting time on this thread because I don't believe it is true, therefore by posting I am helping no one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean is it really that hard to believe that a small time guy has worked his whole fucking life pushing and has saved enough to buy this. The person offered me the 40 keys at 6,000 a piece. That's only 240,000$.  Is everyone here so broke they don't believe it's possible for someone to have that dollar amount. If your not going to be helpful than please just shut the fuck up. Your only wasting your own time typing.

    If you're prepared to lose all the money you've saved and are happy to take the risk, then go for it, it's your money to spend how you see fit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still believe either you're trolling or that your friend can see how naive you are and is planning on ripping you off and I'll explain why.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If he says you have to buy 40 keys to get 'x' price, then he's going to be going to someone else to buy 40 or more keys for him to get whatever price he's getting it for and nobody is going to drip feed a key per week for 40 weeks and honor the price on a 40 key deal, not now, not ever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly, it would be very wasteful for you to transport 1 key per week from Brazil to the USA, your costs would blow out if you only use one method and if a single key gets detected, the DEA are going to build a case against you that will see you in prison for the next 25 years.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thirdly, nobody that deals in quantity (multiple kgs+ at a time) is going to come on SR and use escrow to help out a first timer, it's hilarious to even suggest it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You say you're a hard gambler? Go down, buy your 40 keys straight up, sail your ass from Brazil all the way up the coast, through the Panama Canal then up the coast of Central America and Mexico, land along the coast of northern Mexico and hand the goods over to your other 'friend' who can get it from Mexico to the USA. Alternatively hook up with some commercial fisherman from San Diego and dead drop your package in the middle of the ocean with a GPS transponder, give them the locater and have them collect it on their next fishing run and bring it back into the US of A amongst all the smelly fish. And make sure you pay everybody, and pay them well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ....or maybe not?

    I'm not offering anything, because it's ridiculous to ask how to import 40kg of cocaine via the an internet forum.
    <br/>
    Anyone who needs to ask this is clearly not up for this...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a fairly solid idea on how to do it, but I wouldn't consider it, unless I knew ALL the details about everything. And I knew the person selling it to me very well, etc.
    <br/>
    But I have a feeling this guy is just gunna lose a shitload of money and then will regret it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it's one of those "too good to be true" situations.

    Quit while you are ahead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is my best advice - There are thousands of drug dealers on this site - All of them telling you to not go through with this.
    <br/>
    If you've done well selling drugs, keep selling drugs - Don't import them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's like working on checkouts at Wal-mart for 10 years. You know what you are doing, but you want to step up and be the manager and get more money.
    <br/>
    To be a successful manager, you need to work with the manager for 1 year and learn how everything is done and gain experience in being the manager. Then you become the manager.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You want to just suddenly step up from being on the checkouts and be a manager straight away. You have no experience in being a manager and you have no idea what you are doing. The store is going to fail and you will lose your job and you end up worse off then before.

    He originally offered a key for 26 which isn't bad. It's just not that life changing purchase. In truth it's starting to sound better for many reasons just to buy a key at a time at his 26 price. I don't know this needs thinking time.

    If you really have access to 40 kilos of coke. I will teach you how to successfully smuggle it back to the states. I have decent experience in this kind of thing and I know people who could write you guides upon guides for doing this shit.

    It's not going to be cheap, though. I either want $10'000, or 2.5 keys.

       Well like fred said, if someone has access to that amount I could imagine they'd have specific ways of importation. The price you pay for 40 kilos depends on how you import it. You realise once it's in USA or whatever destination country the price nearly doubles? Successfully import that much you'd be retiring early.

       I was actually going to write a similar thread, lesser amount, different drug. Was looking at picking a kilo of MDMA up from Germany to UK without using the post. Things like this take planning.

     But don't go with 5 men in your car smelling of weed and giggling like fuck when handing over your passports or they'll call the sniffer dogs out. Go with family on a weekend trip, or look for UK tours of Paris, Berlin etc easy enough to take it on them coaches without much risk to yourself even if it is caught.

    Even if they did get the dogs out, for bulk amounts do wrap, MBB, wash with isopropyl alcohol, 2nd MBB, wash again with isopropyl alcohol (hey, nothing wrong with paranoia).

    Easy enough to conceal 20kg in a car without causing too much suspicion.

    Dunno if yu are a troll or not, I don't find the situation completely impossible. For that amount, you are going to need an established green listed route from a to b and piggy back on it. Dont think you would be the first person to try it, and it aint gonna be easy organizing it.

    First part was for you. KG of MD if you chose to take in in the car, an affordable financial loss. Hard to deny its yours in the car though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second part was for the man with the coke. 40KGs not such an affordable loss. Hence the piggy back on a green listed companies route.

    nonsense you'll get scammed. you're meeting that guy F2F or playing James Bond over internet? my money says he bought good grams sent them to you and is now plotting a scam for "supposed" 40 keys of coke...  How much do you pay for a key ? Not much for you in US is a fortune in South America... If I were him I would send some white powder and claim atleast 25-50% of the money in escrow..

    Just for the love of the almighty flying spaghetti monster, don't put all your money down on it.  If you're really that far along on your drug career, you already know that.  Be careful getting caught up on the big offer too soon, but have a plan and stick to it.

    Man this thread is still going. Long story short everything worked and shit wasn't fake. Can't give the details, but it was simpler than I thought. We are doing it over a period of time and so far the first shipment has come through. Also we are using a stealth listing On the road with escrow for every piece.

    Just what I was thinking! Anyone who needs to ask on a public internet forum about how to import 40kg cocaine clearly has no clue.
    <br/>
    If it were that easy, alot more people would be doing it, and the prices of cocaine in the US would drop.

    Holy crap, lets say it really was real and someone said how to bring it in.  Then the LE spies that troll this and similar sites would be on the lookout for the exact description of what someone said was a 40 kilo load. Plus, anyone that moves 40 bricks has an established method for doing so and they probably don't need any help or advice on how to ply their trade.  Once something reaches domestic territory there are supply routes already established for large orders.  40 kilos, yeah, ok.  What are the dimensions of one brick? Length, width, thickness, how many layers of wrapping are there?  Is there a stamp?  Whats it look like?

    Hey I still don't know how to import 40 kilos. We are doing it in smaller amounts over a period of time. The vendor who's selling to me knows what he's doing clearly as the first shipment came flawlessly.
    <br/>
    This noob right here is ballin.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Oh and as a side note, when looking for a good connection on cocaine I channeled tony76's ghost and he gave me a legit connection. Just don't forget everyone FE means ForEver getting good deals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway this shit is fire and I will be offering it soon on the road with full escrow.  I'm not sure as of yet, but to get some customers I think I will be doing a gram giveaway to 50 different established members with over 1000$ spent on the road.

    Giving out 50g of fire coke for free?  lol.  Unfortunately many people will readily give their name and address to a brand new vendor in hopes of getting something for free.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I actually hope you're full of shit because if you aren't then you're going to eventually get fucked or put into jail for a long time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: I misunderstood that each of 50 members would get a gram of coke.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really hate to see people get too involved and get fucked though, even if they are being reckless.  If you get caught trafficking large quantities of cocaine then kiss your life goodbye.  Not worth it in my opinion.

    I can't believe I just found this thread today, Easter Sunday. Hilarious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just have one thing to add. People will always put in their two cents on other people's business. Well this was sort of what the OP was asking for in the beginning. But any successful businessman knows to never listen to other people's free advice. You're not going to get good advice on the SR forums. The advice you get here, or anywhere else for that matter, is worth what you pay for it, nothing. You want good advice? You want someone to take care of this smuggling operation for you? Hook up with some professionals, and pay them well. This is true whether you are importing dresses, computers, or cane. If you are ballsy or stupid enough to do things as CFP wants to do, then more power to him. All the other details of the matter, you can pay someone to help you. The businessman supplies the balls and the money, and everyone else gets the job done for him for a fee. Stop asking for free advice on the forums. Asking for free business advice is the true sign of an amateur, in the professional world and in the drug world.

    Learning from free advice is one thing. When you are implementing a plan to import cane, you are beyond the learning phase. You need to be a professional at that point. Professionals, in any field, look within their network, find the experts, and pay those experts to help them get the job done.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The one mistake that amateurs make that gets them in trouble, is they feel they don't need help. That they can handle everything themselves. No man is an island. No business get's accomplished without a team. And no one will play on your team unless you pay them.

    You did open yourself up to all these types of posts when you created this thread so suck it up now and glean what you can from the posts taking each with a pinch of salt. Amateurs or not there is helpful advice on the forums, you just need to be careful about what you take seriously and what you disregard. I would concur with iLBC though in that getting advice from professionals on issues of this nature would be the only way to go, anything else is just scrambling about in the dark.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I flamed you pretty hard right back near the beginning of this thread, if you are really serious about this venture then find the right connections and stay out of trouble.

    Depends on the topic. That might be true of smuggling, but as a counter example, all the research on anonymity is conducted by academics and white/gray hat hackers, and openly published. Most of the people selling anonymity "guides" are scammers. You can find all the info for free, and in some cases the paid advice is dangerous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A few months ago, multiple people came on the forum and asked about increasing entry guards to 8. Apparently someone was selling a guide with that information. Yeah, you don't always get what you pay for.

    You are importing 40kilos at $6000 per kilo and you're going to sell it for probably $100 per gram and make about $3.76 mil profit and you're looking for free advice on the SR forums??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An amateur is not classified by his level of experience in this business. It's characterized by someone's level of experience in life in general. Looking for free advice on a $3.76 mil deal is what I call an amateur.

    I don't know why so many people are saying someone with 40 keys in SA would know how to smuggle it... 40 keys in SA isn't that much. Down in columbia you can get a gram of cocaine for a dollar.... a kg for $250-400.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In bulk 40kg the dude probably got them for about $100 a piece, that's $4000 for 40 keys....which is not that much money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are a few options:
    <br/>
    Disguise very cleverely as a legitimate powdered supplement in Mylar bags, with labels and all, including online receipt, and ship 1 key at a time, or so. Use multiple addresses. Most would get here, some seizures/lost packages are inevitable...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If stealth is on point enough, do the above option and use Fedex and you might be able to get them here 10-20 at a time in a week, tops. If you do this I cannot stress the importance of the MBB bags enough...dogs must not smell them. If the box gets opened and they look legit with receipts and all and proper labels, no Fedex guy is going to slash open one of the bags and smell/taste it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you were really smart though you would get a pilot, to fly you down there, or fly yourself with your own pilots license, and personally pick up the bricks, fly back and land in your own private airfield. I am not an expert on air-regulations, but I can assure you this method is possible and is done by a lot of big-time smugglers.

    Just do what most of the big time smugglers do these days. Get four obese people and pay each of them to be a drugs mule, someone weighing in at 30 stone plus can fit 10 kilos up the bum or in the vadge. Basically this is how the Italian and Mexican Mafia's are doing it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I shouldn't really be telling you this but I know it's true as they used to hire me as a feeder. If they didn't have any fat people around they would pay me to find someone and fatten them up. Proper underground stuff this.

    Of course it's possible the guy in SA doesn't know how to smuggle this but be careful he's obviously an amateur himself. I wouldn't mess with it if I were you unless you can convince some poor Mexican guy to smuggle these for you and plan it out carefully you will get caught. There are many ways to bring these things in. But there are also many ways to get busted. There are guys who have been doing this for many years and know how it works. Of course they are not going to share secrets like this with you. If you are really willing to take the risk and the reward is that promising do your research and figure it out. If your capital is limited I highly doubt you can arrange a delivery like this unless you can find investors who trust you well. If someone came to me personally with a plan like this I would first say "how well do you really know the guy in south america" first and foremost. Secondly, these types of transactions cannot be made by the typical SR routes of shipping through courier. I'm not saying it's not possible but 40kg would take forever to get here and you would probably lose at least half of it through Courier.  Your not going to find your answer here buddy. But if you want it bad enough you will have to figure it out. Do you research on mexican imports. That's probably the most feasible route.

     Well like fred said, if someone has access to that amount I could imagine they'd have specific ways of importation. The price you pay for 40 kilos depends on how you import it. You realise once it's in USA or whatever destination country the price nearly doubles?

    Doubles? I don't think you understand how poor they are in Colombia. No one would risk their neck the way they have for the past 50-odd years just for a 100% profit margin. That is nothing in the drug business. You may as well be selling knick-knacks at an antique shop for god's sake.

    EDIT: Sorry Hoff, I did not notice the dates. I was wondering why I was seeing chaosforpeace for the first time in a while, too.

    Speaking of which, where did stexo run off to?
