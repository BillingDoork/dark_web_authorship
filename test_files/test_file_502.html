    I should of added im from Australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was thinking that the more packages i order the higher the chance of 1 getting through but perhaps if 1 package does get detected then they will flag all my mail and i'll get done for all of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So most people here just do 1 package at a time then?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks

    It's hard to answer you correctly due to there being so many variables which could affect delivery times. I have done what you did in my earlier days on SR and it all went smooth (was actually 8 orders at once) but in saying that, I wouldn't do it again and was probably pushing the envelope a little. Different vendors from different countries was a good decision in the scheme of things. You should be fine but as I said, if just one of the variables out of your control goes sour, it could potentially jeopardize your other packages. I'll PM you with some other tips.

    surely if you were new and just started, a person with common sense would tread lightly, and make single small orders just to test the waters.

    Also you can request the Vendor put "Vacations for Less" as the return address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could also have them put the Ebay logo somewhere on the package
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I were a vendor, I'd print up envelopes that say. "Thank you for using Ebay"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was a big Ebayer for the last 10 years, and I've lived at current address for 6 years, they've seen every shape and style package coming and going to and from every continent on the planet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With all the online shopping being done? - The more they make it look like THAT type of commerce the better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I order 6 in one day. What are the chances they're all going to arrive the same day? - Most of the time, out of 4? - 1 is unexpectedly early, 1 is right on time, and 2 are late, one of the two, really fucking late!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LOL!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck from "up above" (if you're down under, that's what I am, right?)

    It's OK as long as shit doesn't go south. If one gets intercepted, then your addy will be watched for sure and that's gonna become a whole different story :-[. And that should go without saying, but order from vendor known for their stealth.

    Thanks for the replies fellas,i think ive found a really good overseas vendor,he says and does all the right things and seems a complete pro.Buying of the right person is the most crucial thing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also i like the idea of tracking,gives u peace of mind that the package has been sent.
