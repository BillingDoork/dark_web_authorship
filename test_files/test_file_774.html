    You could easily place an order for 10,000 bags and not have anyone blink and eye, these are used to package products remember.Â  you can look up canning stores in your area however, might have canning retort bags or something similar, or metalized bags for packing fish, jerky, ect.
    <br/>

    disaster preparedness nuts use these bags for their end of the world food storage bags, if you need a cover story :)

    my local canning store has bags.

    most ALL grocery stores everywhere carry them. all walmart, target, etc sell them. They are also known as "turkey bags" that you use to cook in the oven. Good luck

    a turkey bag is not a moisture barrier bag!
    <br/>
    if you can see through the bag, it isnt.
