    Hi all,
    <br/>
    a short question I am having about orders from the Netherlands, maybe some buyers from the EU and sellers from NL can post some comments... I know shipments leaving NL are probably inspected more closely than in other EU countries. How high though is the actual success rate of shipping drugs, esp. weed, outisde of NL? I see quite a few vendors from NL shipping worldwide selling dozens of grams of weed or even kilos. There reputation is mostly good as well, anyhow, can packaging make up for the closer look of the guys from LE or should one always consider a higher and not estimatable risk when ordering from NL?
    <br/>
    Sorry if this has asked before, didnt find anything in the search....

    Depending on how much you are buying the NL thing is massively overstated. If you are buying say anything up to 10g of whatever and the product is flat or can be flattened (Blow, Mandy crushed, Cid you get the picture) you basically have next to fuck all to worry about. I have never had a buy stopped from NL and I frequently shop with our friendly Dutch neighbors. If you are talking bulk or weight, yes there is more risk but the Dutch tend to make up for this by having extremely creative shipping, much more than people from less high-profile countries. So really NL is more of a risk yes but they balance it out by putting in much more effort when it comes to stealth.

    Hope this answers your questions. :)

    As a buyer from another EU-country I can only say that I have never had any problems with shipments from the NL, and I have ordered rather a lot from there.
