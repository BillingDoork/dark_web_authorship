    I'm brand new. About to make my first bitcoin transfer and buy on SR. What should I not do when the package gets here? If I am asked to sign a package should I?Â  I'm getting my packages shipped to my buddy's house (he is never there, but he owns it) if nobody is at the apartment when thepackage gets there and they want me to sign. Will they keep coming back till somebody is there to sign?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I plan on using fake information from a website that has working fake information. Is that okay to do but put down the right address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Information will be very helpful. Thank you in advance

    Signing isn't normal, most vendors say that they will never require a signature. I would be paranoid about being asked to sign, especially for a larger order. I'd use my normal information, and I think most buyers here would agree with that, judging from responses I've seen from people asking about using fake or real information.

    Use real information, but do not sign for the package if asked to do so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you use fake information, several things can go wrong. First, in some cases deliveries will only be made to an address if the addressee is a registered occupant of the premises and if you use a fake name the package will not be delivered. Secondly, the postman himself may become suspicious and open the package if he knows his route well. Thirdly, if for some reason the postman is unable to deliver the package, you will not be able to collect it from the depot because you have used fake information. Fair enough, not everyone would take the risk of collecting it in person anyway, but if you use fake info that option is completely out the window.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With regards to signing for delivery, most vendors ship via methods that do not require a signature. So if you are asked to do so, it is probably not a good idea. They will not keep coming back for you to sign if you do not answer the door, they usually leave a delivery note that you bring to the collection depot along with some ID to pick up the package. But you should definitely check with your vendor in advance as some vendors do require recorded delivery on some items - usually high cost or high risk products.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, one thing you should absolutely not do when the package arrives is to open it immediately on the spot on the premises where you received the delivery. Once you have the package in your hands, get out of the place and go somewhere else before you tear into it. This is a vital step that is often overlooked.
