    So I have been looking lately and it seems alot of vendors may be charging a good deal, maybe an intro offer or just a generaly good deal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then you look for postage and some are charging .50 around $14 Australian, which is ridiculous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is anyone else get a little annoyed with shipping prices?

    With recent changes to USPS rules, most vendors have been forced to revamp both stealth and tracking methods. Both of which can raise the cost of shipping as it did with us. Also think about gas prices or the cost of help if they do that sort of thing. Everything costs money and if 10 dollars for shipping is too much to have safe drugs sent to you then your not the type of buyer a seller would like to keep. It's much better to over stealth and be pricey then to get your customers caught. Now I'm not advocating 40 dollar shipping on a point of H but weigh what all it takes to get that drug to you SAFE.

    For the prices of quality O/S gear, i would pay double that to ensure safe delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've saved hundreds from buying O/S...delivery costs...meh. :P

    I'm in Australia and mainly use domestic, so when they charge $10 for a baggy inside a baggy between a few pieces of paper isn't stealth and worth the money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can really understand if I was ordering from overseas but the risk is too great for myself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    As with anything, you get what you pay for.  I'm in favor of offering basic shipping @ USPS cost and the faster services at a bit of a markup so that there is an extra incentive to process and ship very fast.
