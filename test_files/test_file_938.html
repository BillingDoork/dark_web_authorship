    long story short.  Priority package hasnt arrived, should have last saturday.  Had a reship expressed yesterday to be here "guaranteed" by 3pm, no show.  Even have the tracking number from express, it just says something like this item cant be tracked via the website, check receipt or something or other.  Is this just a coincidence and the express might take an extra day like it happens sometimes, or are my packages being seized.  The vendor said the first tracking for priority was stuck at leaving sort facility.  I HIGHLY doubt the vendor is fucking me, like VERY sure he is not, i just cant imagine he would do that.  Any ideas?

    thats not what i wanted to hear! people get express stuff all the time.  Besides its a real small order, should look just like the other document shipments.

    I had a package that was sent first class mail in the US and the tracking showed it was at a sort facility for like 3-4 days without being updated, but was finally delivered a few days past the expected delivery date, so it might just be a delay or perhaps the package actually got lost?

    yeah that one i'm not too worried about, i figure it will show up eventually. how often do they actually LOSE a package right?  Its the express one thats sketchin me out.  Either 1 its a coincidence that it was also delayed, 2 my packages are being seized, or 3 vendor boned me or gave me inaccurate tracking number which i doubt, ive been in contact with him and he is fairly reputable.

    Enter a random string and compare it to the message you get when entering the tracking number.  They may be the same message -- I had that problem once and didn't realize until I actually called the post office to ask what it meant that their system was telling me I had a bullshit tracking number (this was a legal thing that had gotten lost somewhere).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure they even can just start seizing all your mail... can they?  I mean I suppose they can do anything a court says they can, but is it really within their power to proactively seize all of your shipments like that?  Seems like they'd have to at least say "this guy gets lots of drugs, let's have a dog sniff every package," or something?

    i actually did that, i changed the last number and it gave me the same message so it seems to either be the wrong number or it hasn't been updated yet which happens a lot i hear, but keep in mind it should have been delivered already so its probably something wrong with the number.  And yeah i agree, i doubt theyre being seized, its just that i feel like this is so rare to happen twice in a row.  Theres a part of me that fears that the vendor gave me a fake tracking number so i could finalize the other order for him.  I really don't want to believe that because hes been in contact with me and everything, i dont see why he would fuck me and risk his good rep.  so yeah thats probably not the case, i just cant proven prove that it isnt.  Thanks for the response.

    The post office has been fucking up royally lately. I have one package with confirmed delivery on 3/29 but the recipient, who also happens to be a vendor, swears he hasn't seen it. That could be a scam but I know that delivery times have been slow and tracking has been funky.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A postal worker today told be that the new tracking #s only get scanned upon delivery, but if you track a package it seems to be accounted for along the way.

    I had something sketchy happen recently too, now that you mention it.  Had a domestic package with tracking that suddenly "left sorting facility", with no timestamp, which is where the tracking ended.  For over 36 hours.  I was all "oh shit, it finally happened, now I gotta get rid of these drugs... God damn it."
    <br/>

    Showed up 2 days late just fine though.

    The USPS handles millions of letters, parcels, and packages a week. They fuck up quite frequently. From the delivery person who puts an item in the wrong box to when the airmail service temporarily loses a $1000.00+ Express package for a couple days. There are also mailperson thieves. One postal delivery worker in Washinton state in 2010 was found guilty of failing to deliver most of his mail every day, drinking beer at a local tavern, and then burning or burying the mail when he got home. I wonder if any illicit packages were ever destroyed by this guy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The USPS has been slow as fuck lately though. And the new tracking still has bugs or something.

    alright guys if anyone was wondering, heres what happened with my last fuck up.  So i head over to the post office to pick up my package (always a fun endeavor) because the fucker still hasn't shown (keep in mind this was guaranteed for friday delivery).  I wait in a half hour line because of the damn taxes.  Then when its finally my turn, I tell him what happened and he goes and finds it in 20 seconds.  I guess the guy that was supposed to deliver it was over there and he told the guy working at the front that he "left a notice" even though there was no notice and the SIG WAS WAIVED.  I just have the worst luck with this type of shit happening.

    You can't blame vendors for post office delays and you definitely can't expect vendors to go to the post office and say, "this express package wasn't delivered on time so can I get a refund?"

    We're shipping or receiving illegal substances through the federal mail system.  Just be happy if it finally arrives safely.

    yeah jack, i would really like a refund myself.  i coulda payed ten dollars less and would have gotten more dope and earlier.  its bullshit, but i just don't want to attract too much attention to the package and what not.  not to mention its just a damn hassle to talk to those fuckers and convince them to give you the refund. i'm sure they make it into a whole ordeal

    Patience is key especially when USPS is starting to ask workers unions to consider what to do when they don't get enough money...  USPS employees were salty and will only get saltier.  And mail will only get slower.  Just my opinion.
