    So I am a newbie and this is my second post so please bare with me. I have been pouring over all the posts around shipping Do's and don'ts, UPS, FBI, USPS inner workings and best practices when it come to shipping. The thread about vacuum sealing and MBB bags was amazing! Many of the posts have been. In my past life I worked as a marketing manager for a large company and of course the wheels started turning. In these discussions there slowly seems to be emerging a set of best practices for vendors in shipping. Let's face it a large part of SR is having a place to go buy your drugs safely. There should be a place for that and now there is. Many buyers don't want to buy drugs from the street and the ratings system on SR has the ability to shine a light on sellers who have bad product or are straight up scamming people. The single biggest worry for any new buyer on here is am I going to get busted. Is this seller I am buying my product from just some unprofessional nitwit concerned about their own next high and put very little thought into shipping which will get you busted, not them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What if SR enhanced the feedback ratings system to allow sellers to be rated on shipping specifically? Add to that that SR establishes a set of minimum guidelines for how product is packaged, shipped and labelled. Sellers who commit to these new shipping standards must clearly say so in their postings and buyers can confirm if sellers are indeed following these standards. Let's say a minimum of 10 confirmed sales at the minimum gives you this special designation as a seller. An elite verification level,of sorts for sellers with a focus on shipping safety.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Depending on where we draw the line on minimum shipping best practices, I really see two levels. Elite Level for example could mean you are vacuum sealing at least, correctly labeling boxes, even weight distribution. All those things that will require extra care but the community sets as you should be at least doing this. The Super Elite level would be the top tier where you are using MBB bags, double bagging, heat sealing, washing the outside very well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I realize the extra work involved may off put some sellers, but as a buyer I would pay an extra bitcoin for a service like this. I should at least have that option as a customer. Thoughts?

    Agree, and as I've mentioned before many would be happy to pay extra for sellers to do professional shipping, including test posts with benign contents to measure speed and success.

    I support this idea... I'm similar to you CherryBuster. I've been lurking now for about a week reading all the discussions on shipping. I live in a developed country with drug laws that are extremely harsh. I'm still working out in my mind how/when to make my first purchase and I would definitely pay the premium to buy from a seller that was providing that extra service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My biggest problem at the moment is while I understand the rules in the US and AUS for example, I can't figure out how the laws here work in terms of denyability etc if something gets intercepted by customs... sucks too because the market where I live is huge. No domestic sellers though. All our local dealers are dry at the moment.
