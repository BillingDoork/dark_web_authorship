    Hey Guys i have a question for anyone who would know or has been in this situation, i ordered 3x 3.5g orders of C from a international vendor who i have dealt with many times before, he sent the 3 packages express with tracking, one made it to my friend all in order today, the second 2 are on their way, i just checked the tracking on the 2nd shipment and it goes like this, ITEM RECEIVED AT INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY, ITEM HAS BEEN SENT TO CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRY....
    <br/>
    now does that mean a load of mail has gone to customs to be screened or my mail has gone by itself to customs because they suspect something? i know this vendors stealth is amazing and my friend commented that he wouldnt have known it was his C if not for the name on the letter and "theres no way a dog could have smelt this" what does everyone think? i want a white christmas :(
    <br/>
    thanks for the input guys

    I couldn't give any more info than you probably can guess/summise on your own but I would recommend that if they are in customs you stop checking the tracking for the item and just go forth with the mindset it has been detected and confiscated.

    what's wrong with the fact package is at customs? Every international package gets through customs. And tracking usually reflect current package location. Did I miss something? Or GetOnIt, did you expect your cocaine somehow avoid scanning? They scan everything but usually find nothing :) hope you get it anyway &amp; have nice xmas.

    What he said... it's probably a normal check but I'd still not track the hell out of it or anything in case that looks suspicious.
