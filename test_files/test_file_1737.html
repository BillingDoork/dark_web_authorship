    I received a delivery of 1 gram mdma this AM in UK. The jiffy bag envelope was torn open on one side about half way down . About a 3" rip. Not enough to take out the DVD container inside in which the mdma was encloseed. It may have been possible to prise open the DVD box and look inside. The entire package was enclosed in a clear envelope with a Post Office apology printed on it.
    <br/>
    Should I worry about this?  Can anyone tell me if this is a known tactic by the authorities and if so what should I expect?
    <br/>

    You shouldn't be revealing how your vendor packaged it nor should you state the quantity!
    <br/>
    From what I can tell there has been no customs interference with this, if it's got a post office sticker then it was just damaged and the PO is courteous enough to make sure it wasn't further wrecked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No harm to make sure any evidence of SR is removed from your desktop/laptop but I highly doubt anything would happen over a gram ;).

    Much obliged to you. BTW was sent within UK so no customs involved  :D Just thought it was a big coincidence, it being my 1st purchase. Agree should not be discussing specific packaging method.  :-X
