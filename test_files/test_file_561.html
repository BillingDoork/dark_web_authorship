    Anyone familiar with the "my bybox" service in the UK? (http://my.bybox.com/)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically they give you a locker in a public place, with a postal address, and you can collect the mail from it - and it is self-service (not over a counter.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would this be suitable for receiving contraband items, and is there any reason it would be more risky than receiving at your home address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What if you paid them with a prepaid credit card?

    As long as its not linked to you or your home i dont see a problem with it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But on the other hand, packages being sent to these boxes may have more scrutiny..? I doubt it but you never know.
    <br/>
    Are people in the UK experiencing postal theft? What brought about these boxes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the sounds of it they are very suitable to receive goods, if payable with pre-paid credit then all the better.

    The only problem I can see is that you can't really claim you weren't expecting the package. If they do intercept the package and for whatever reason decide to camp out and wait for you, you can't just say "someone sent drugs to my address, not my fault" because you paid for the delivery. I feel like while it makes it more anonymous it also gives you less of an excuse for receiving drugs there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I'm really not sure how these services work so take my comment with a grain of salt.

    That's my view on it. Less deniability.
