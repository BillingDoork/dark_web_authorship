    I'm doing some research into the wild, wacky and wonderful world of Silk Road vending.  I can see a number of niches in this market through which an enterprising vendor could make a modest income. (I'd love to figure out a way to get the Wizard's Magic Rice Krispie Treats, Mexican Brownies, and other treats guaranteed to tickle your tastebuds and cannabinoid receptors...  but shipping edibles looks like it would be an enormous pain in the ass.  It's a pity, as the Grand Wizard's culinary skills are legendary).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I figured a good place to start would be vending some 2c-b capsules and seeing how things go from there.  Once I've done a small run I'll be able to ascertain if the efforts adequately repay the potential rewards and take the next step from there. What are best practices for shipping capsules discreetly and securely and ensuring they don't get crushed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All advice greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

    I was aiming at the lazy stoner market - a demographic  I know very well.  ;)  My idea was to provide 22-25mg capsules, which should be more than enough for a healthy 2c-b experience, at a reasonable price.  I am guessing there are a lot of people who want to try 2c-b but who don't want to deal with the hassle of weighing out powders etc.  But I could definitely ship powder on request.

    You can actually get teeny-tiny caps, but I'm not even sure they'd inconspicuously fit in a normal envelope.  Worth a try though I guess but they'd be a bugger to fill.  I struggled with my 2CB just weighing the stuff (Cheap 0.001 scales are still cheap scales), so if you can get a reputation for super accurately weighing out RC's and bunging them in caps, you'd be on to a good thing I reckon.

    I have some teeny-tiny capsules heading my way, in 2 different colors.  Right now it looks like the first offerings in the Grand Wizard's Lair will be
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - 2c-b capsules, 25mg: $10 each, five for $40
    <br/>
    - 2c-t-7 caps, 20mg, $8 each, five for $35
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Later on I'm thinking about offering 10mg tablets of 5-meo-mipt for $7, five for $30.  I may also start offering poppy straw when/if I find a reliable dealer for poppy pods, as well as anything else which might look appealing.  I'm still working on opening day -- I've bought the vendor account (GrandWizardsLair) and am just waiting to get the products and do the Marquis/Mecke/Simons tests on them.  And while I'm presently planning on doing domestic US only I might be persuaded to send international and am looking now into what that would entail. So keep your eyes on the forums and get ready to enter the Grand Wizard's Lair.  (You can stop playing the organ music now, Igor).

    Smarties are harder to make but you make them in bigger batches and they won't break during shipping. I used to make 100s of smarties in a couple minutes. Capsules are just bad because they break so easily even in a bubble envelope and they take up so much room.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And for the love of god never put a rigid object in a letter. It is so incredibly obviously when there is a capsule in a letter.
