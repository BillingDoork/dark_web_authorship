    I have had small shipments of mdma sent to my university with no problem, usually 1g. But I recently decided to make a bulk order of 20gs and I have a couple of questions i've had trouble coming across on the forums so I apologize if this is a little redundant. If customs were to intercept such a large quantity of mdma would they attempt to pursue the buyer or just send them a loveletter? Ive only received the mdma in envelopes not a package so my other question is, how often are packages intercepted as opposed to envelopes? Personal experience, stories will be much appreciated. And for all the people who seem to think that sending it to a university is stupid then read up on plausible deniability, its much easier to deny the package is yours at a school full of willing and able kids, when they dont ID check when you pickup your mail. All help is appreciated!!

    Holy fucking poop LOL
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And not necessarily. I had 55gs of some mdma out of NL get caught up in miami customs. Sender had hidden the drugs inside of a food item. Customs opened the food item's packaging, dug into the food, fished out the 55gs, took out ~5gs of mdma, then they slapped green tape all over the remaining 50gs, then finally they threw it back into the box to the side of the food. They put more green tape all over the box, then proceeded to send it through lol.

    controlled delivery is when they knock on your door, give you your package, wait for you to open it then bust in your door and point guns in your face
    <br/>
    a raid, is when they skip step 1 and just bust down your door and point guns in your face
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you have a dog, they will shoot it.
    <br/>
    if you shoot one of them because you're armed and they didn't announce who they are, you'll serve a lifetime sentence for murdering a law enforcement officer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if either of these happen don't deny, don't talk, do not fight back, get a lawyer immediately.

    It's not even an ounce lol maybe if you're hauling in kilos of something they'll investigate you but anything smaller than 1/2lb isn't really worth their time. I've read cases about people getting investigated for QPs but just a knock on the door with the question "Do you know anything about a suspicious package sent from xxx?" not 12 cops breaking down your door and shooting your poor little doggie.

    No idea about how cops do this, but I would guess Customs doesn't pursue (depending on how bulk of course..) but they hold the evidence and alert the local police. Up to the local police how much they want to pursue. If you live in the suburbs and the police are board, I would bet they pursue a bit.
