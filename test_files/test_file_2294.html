    I have informations that Operation Pangea V will start next week!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you dont know what Operation Pangea is:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Pharmaceutical-crime/Operations/Operation-Pangea
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "
    <br/>
    Operation Pangea is an international week of action tackling the online sale of counterfeit and illicit medicines and highlighting the ﻿ dangers of buying medicines online. Coordinated by INTERPOL, the annual operation brings together customs, health regulators, national police and the private sector from countries around the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Activities target the three principal components used by illegal websites to conduct their trade – the Internet Service Provider (ISP), payment systems and the delivery service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The operation has gained significant momentum since its launch in 2008. The first phase of the operation brought together 10 countries, with the number rising to more than 80 in 2011.
    <br/>
    "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TO ALL BUYERS/VENDORS:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I highly recommend stop ordering/seding from now on and resume after Operation Pangea.

    Or we could just carry on as normal because operation pangea cant touch SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's look at the science here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Information to and from the SR servers is being sent around the world at the speed of light. It's impossible to get the spatial coordinates of where the information came from and where its final destination was. Its impossible to even decrypt the information (well theoretically possible, but it would take a LONNNG time or a heck of a lot of computing power).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And operation pangea runs for the grand total of SEVEN DAYS!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ....all I can do is laugh.

    Awww... isn't that sweet, the faggots are concerned about our safety. That's why they want to raid our houses and terrorize our family members and throw us in prison cells.
