    I need help with ideas to get SR items sent to a place where I can pick up. I don't want anyone at my house snooping around my mail and I cannot get a PO box. Any other options? Maybe a drop house, but how does one find out how  to find one?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help/ideas are greatly appreciated

    I would think it's suspicious to a post worker if no mail ever goes to a house and then suddenly a package turns up to an abandonded house.  If you were to choose that route for some reason, I'd start sending mail there and junk mail to make it look like someone lives there first...still probably not the best idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know people do that but it doesn't seem viable.  Postal workers get to know their routes...the UPS or FedEx guy may not, but those shipping options aren't nearly as safe as USPS.

    I agree with John, but I think it also depends on what kinda area you live in. Anytime I have ever seen an "abandoned house" Its boarded up to high heaven and there is normally a big "CONDEMED" sticker on the sheet of plywood that use to be the front door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...but that may just be me. I heard the country is nice in some places.  :-X

    I think shipping to an abandon house will result in a RTS (return to sender).  I would not do it.
    <br/>
    "Current resident" addressee would work as long as you don't live with someone who doesn't know about your habits (roommate, kids, parents, etc).

    "Curent Resident" is frowned on by most on the board here. There are lots of reasons and I can't say that I agree with all of them, but I will say the only time I could see "Current Resident" not looking suspicious is if you are mailing out a letter. With something small and flat in it.

    Think about it. No one gets a priority box sent to their door for "Current Resident"

    True. If the address is legit, and people live there they will deliver it. But they would also know there is something shady going on for the reason you mentioned. You are just drawing attention to yourself if one does this.

    If you have a friend that's okay with it just have it sent to his house under his name. Make sure his house is clean though, that way if the worst were to happen they'd have nothing on him. (He didn't purchase the bitcoins, he wasn't accessing SR, and he has no drugs in his house to add proof to their suspicion.).

    I haven't ordered anything off SR - yet.  If the packing is done right, and the address is correct the only way it will be intercepted is with bad luck.
    <br/>
    Nobody should be sending anything that requires a signature.  If  something is sent Express Mail sender should waiver the signature-that way the mailman just drops it off and goes on.
    <br/>
    If the package wont fit in a mail box most drop it off at the door and move on. But in some neighborhoods of high crime, or for what ever other reasons dog on porch-Gate locked etc etc, they will leave a notice to pick up the package at the P.O. ,
    <br/>
    and that is when you will get nervous and think it might be a setup. It's just a notice to pick up your package, if it doesn't require a signature and you used a fake name they really shouldn't ask for an ID but might anyway and so things are screwed up now so,
    <br/>
    for that reason you might use your real name along with the fake name...example....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mr Fake Name
    <br/>
    Care/of Mr Real name
    <br/>
    your address
    <br/>
    Your city State Zip
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The bad thing about fake names is....if you are popped you are going to have to make up some fairy tail, about your imaginary friend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do NOT use the name of an old resident. If the mailman knows they moved he will forward the package -if they put in a forward -or he will send it back it they didn't put in a forwarding address, as "Moved Left no Address" If they moved long ago, it will get sent back as, "Forward order expired".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Really the best options are.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Your name and your address and hope you are not a part of the 1% -if you are keep your mouth shut and make them prove in court any charges-it wont be easy.
    <br/>
    2. A friends name and friends address  (hard to find friends like these)
    <br/>

    When someone applies for a PO box they ask for ID and want to know their real address. And then they verify with the mail carrier if they really do live at that address. If I'm ordering shyt in the mail and it wont fit in my PO box it's going to be sitting in the PO until the customer goes to the window with their slip to pick it up -sounds like trouble to me. But there might be PO Boxes sold outside the USPS system that I don't know anything about how they work.

    There are plenty of PO box places other than USPS just go online and look for one around your area. They usually call them mail centers or postal centers. When you get a big box they just keep it in the back and leave a slip in your box, then you take the slip and they'll give you your box. I wouldn't recommend using a fake id either because then you'll automatically get in trouble and they'll investigate you even more, but honestly if you're not ordering large amounts you'll be okay. I mean think about it how many buyers are coming on to the forums saying they got busted?

    @ SomeGuy35There -- THANK YOU! Your creative ideas seem the best route to go. The intention looks clear enough and the blame can be placed on somebody who deserves it, not to mention you can use that with virtually anyone. I've been reading over the forums the last couple days and I'm really surprised at the wealth of information on these boards. Good stuff!
    <br/>

    Not to press you too much, but do you mind if I PM you with some questions? There's really nothing that supplements for inside information.

    If you are who you say you are. (and I have read the rest of this thread, so I think you may just be) You could be a potentially HUGE asset to this board and this community.

    And for that potential alone I thank and welcome you!

    +1 for the sound advice.

    Quasi-Federal-Agency meaning ya'll were going broke so the gov dumped you like a date the morning after prom. Sold you to yourself; allowed you to call yourself a "private business" just so the gov didn't look like shit for you busting your ass for years and still losing what should have been "Federal pension"?

    I pledge to always use USPS for all my postal needs. Consider it the virtual "buying you a beer" mate.

    This is true? After getting a USPS PO Box they call to verify your address?

     When someone applies for a PO box they ask for ID and want to know their real address. And then they verify with the mail carrier if they really do live at that address. If I'm ordering shyt in the mail and it wont fit in my PO box it's going to be sitting in the PO until the customer goes to the window with their slip to pick it up -sounds like trouble to me. But there might be PO Boxes sold outside the USPS system that I don't know anything about how they work.

    Nothing wrong with a PO BOX as far as im concerned as long as you are able to work out the name of the person who had it previously, then send all mail to it using their name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know for a fact this works as i still receive the mail to my PO BOX for the previous owner.. Initials are also fine as it has also worked...
