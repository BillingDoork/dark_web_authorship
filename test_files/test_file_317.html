    Just looking for some info, this is the first package ive had go "missing". Its been sitting in customs for over 3 weeks. Still no LL but the order was for 6-10 oz of Methylone. Obviously i know now not to sign for the package but does anyone think it would be likely for them to follow up on this amount?

    How do you know it's been sitting with customs for three weeks? do people in the US receive notices from customs?

    It is a tracked parcel, I was able to see when it entered customs.

    I would clean house to be safe.  And don't sign for anything.  If it isn't your mailman (when and if the package comes) deny it....signature or not.  That's a pretty good amount, but who knows.   This is a good time to step up your security and fix any flaws.  Paranoia is good to some extent.

    Did it go through ISC?    Did it actually say 'inbound into customs' or just 'sorted through processing center'?  They don't always do an outbound scan.
