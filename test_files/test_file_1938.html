    Been happily ordering small samples of pills on SR for a few months now. Recently just placed my first order for weed, it was only 1 gram, and it arrived today. To my dismay, the smell of weed was easily detectable from the package. There was no vacuum sealing, just a small ziploc. Assuming that it was sent to my real address, but under a different name, how worried should I be? Some things to consider:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * Package was sent priority mail, with a delivery confirmation number. If the package were flagged, isn't there now proof in the system so to speak? Also, the DCN was sent to me unencrypted via SR's messages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * Seller put *my* address as the return address as well as the delivery address (isn't this dumb?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it is virtually impossible that the smell went undetected. I've looked at the delivery confirmation details and there doesn't seem to have been any long delay as it made its way here (it's my understanding that opening a package requires a warrant and that takes time). I retrieved the package several hours ago, have gone out since, so obviously there is no arrest taking place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I am worried about future deliveries. I have several small samples of pills (schedule 2 stuff) on its way to the same name &amp; address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe I'm blowing this out of proportion (it's only a gram), if so let me know. What should I do about the stuff that's on its way?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, what kind of rating should I give this seller? Isn't it possible he's "ruined" my address at this point? Shipping something that can be detected as drugs by a human without even opening the package - isn't that like the worst thing short of being scammed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for any feedback in this matter.

    You have a right to be upset. It doesn't matter how small the order is, or how big it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This vendor needs to be reported to the SR staff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sending a package with your address as the return address is a huge red flag.
    <br/>
    Not vacuum sealing weed multiple times is not excusable.
    <br/>
    DCN's should never be sequential, and they shouldn't be sent to customers. The theory is if they are sequential and one package gets tagged, all of the packages within range of the sequence would also get tagged. How do you get non-sequential DCN tags? There is no immediate answer, over the course of the next year, randomly grab some DCN tags, sit on them, mix them up, use them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think your postman just probably laughed that your package smelled like pot, and shrugged it off. You probably got lucky, either that or they let it through thinking you are a bigger target and you are being watched. Honestly its impossible for you to know the answer to this unless you have a Mole at the DEA and your local authorities.

    You should leave a 1/5 rating and never deal with that vendor again. Piss-poor packaging methods are meant to be exposed and corrected. If not corrected then that vendor simply shouldn't be used, by anyone. You might also want to name the vendor, or at least that's my suggestion. Getting forum-flak will, hopefully, make the vendor more likely to fix their methods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOTE: I'm not a legal expert. The following is conjecture. Don't take my word for it. Always be cautious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That having been said... there might be cause for concern, yes. There is a limited chance that your address has gotten flagged. Though, with a gram of weed the more-likely result would have been that it simply gets seized without even a letter sent to you. Legally speaking, once a warrant has been served and a packaged searched, if it contains weed then they can't deliver it via normal methods. A controlled delivery or pure seizure is the only option at that point, as far as I am aware. In the case of seizure without a letter, your address may be flagged and stronger scrutiny could be placed on your packages. As such, it is important that the receiving address be clean and clear of all illegal substances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is my understanding, however, that outside of major amounts (1+ pound weed, or the equivalent in other drugs.), the worst you are likely to face is an attempted controlled delivery, and the worst that can happen to you there, if you don't sign, is... well, nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOTE: Again, I am NOT a legal expert. There may be more recourse for LE in the case of a controlled delivery not being signed for than I am aware of. Be careful in all cases. Clean house, and KEEP that house clean.

    If they do know that it arrived at your door than what they are doing now is checking your mail so that they can get more evidence for a bigger bust rather than just a gram and a few pills. But it was such a small amount that this most likely is not the case as a gram doesn't indicate a drug enterprise run by you. I would say, for now, your safe.

    Thanks for the feedback guys. The seller's name is "quick buds" and I'll send him a link to this thread in case he wants to say anything. I blame myself too because if I had carefully read his feedback, 3 people complained about the packaging, with 1 saying they could smell it. The thing is, 2 of these people gave him a 5 of 5 and the other a 4 of 5! Only now has someone given him a 1 of 5 for exactly the same problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know in the grand scheme of things that I am probably safe. I read another thread on here where someone got a love letter and then was still able to receive drugs afterwards. But the thing is, whatever risk there was in ordering drugs through SR has gone up, whether that be actual risk or perceived risk. And my level of paranoia has gone up and will probably never be the same again. All for a measly gram of weed. Not sure I'll ever order any schedule 2 stuff again, until I have another address, which won't be until I move, which won't be anytime soon. And just when I was starting to have some fun here on SR :(

    Jesus, just a ziploc bag? That's... sketchy as hell. I'd stay away from that vendor, vacuum sealing isn't hard but clearly your safety isn't worth this vendor's time. Find another vendor!

     The first thing i would like to say is i am a nub. I care about my customers i just dont know the tricks of the trade yet. Instead of hammering me in to the ground how giving me some tips? I welcome suggestions and will do whatever needs to be done in order to be a respected seller.

    Well, for starters, you could show a little more respect, especially if you're new around here. Don't go throwing around snide comments when you're risking his personal safety with your sub-par shipping methods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Learn to vacuum seal your packages. Weed has a strong smell, so I'd recommend at least triple vacuum sealing your products. Regardless, a ziploc bag is completely unacceptable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look at how other vendors ship their methods. Read the reviews of high ranked vendors and see if buyers leave reviews praising the shipping method. Do a lot of people mention that it was stealthy? Good. Consider a purchase from them or sending a message to them to get some tips or ideas as to how to better conceal your package. Don't ship anything until you improve your shipping, because if someone else gets a ziploc bag of weed, they're going to give you another 1/5. You've got a chance to improve your methods and pull your rating back up, so take some time off and learn how to do it right or you won't have any buyers. Best of luck.

    This, and your private message to me that simply read "live and learn", makes the transaction even more regrettable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not given to paranoia, and believe I took a very measured approach. I'm relatively new, so I solicited feedback from other, more experienced, SR users. Notice that not one of them said "it's nothing to worry about".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree that "nobody is coming" for me at the moment. But do you understand that my use of SR goes well beyond the one gram of weed I ordered from you? I have no other address that I can use. Everyone at the post office who came into contact with that package could smell it, I can guarantee that. So that is a known. Whether any of them cared enough to report it, or to scrutinize anything coming to that address in the future, is an unknown.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered stuff through SR because the benefits outweighed the risks. The risk has gone up thanks to your careless packaging. The risks would arguably have gone up simply by you using the same address for the return address. The smell of weed is in a whole different league altogether. Now the risks may outweigh the rewards for certain things I wanted to order on SR. Not everything for sale is as "innocuous" as marijuana.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And that's what I'm pissed about mostly -- how this has affected my safety with future SR transactions. I can't be sure that anything else I order will not receive special scrutiny. You can't be sure either. I had no *specific* reason to be worried about it before. Now I do.

      This, and your private message to me that simply read "live and learn", makes the transaction even more regrettable.

      <br/>
      I'm not given to paranoia, and believe I took a very measured approach. I'm relatively new, so I solicited feedback from other, more experienced, SR users. Notice that not one of them said "it's nothing to worry about".
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I agree that "nobody is coming" for me at the moment. But do you understand that my use of SR goes well beyond the one gram of weed I ordered from you? I have no other address that I can use. Everyone at the post office who came into contact with that package could smell it, I can guarantee that. So that is a known. Whether any of them cared enough to report it, or to scrutinize anything coming to that address in the future, is an unknown.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I ordered stuff through SR because the benefits outweighed the risks. The risk has gone up thanks to your careless packaging. The risks would arguably have gone up simply by you using the same address for the return address. The smell of weed is in a whole different league altogether. Now the risks may outweigh the rewards for certain things I wanted to order on SR. Not everything for sale is as "innocuous" as marijuana.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And that's what I'm pissed about mostly -- how this has affected my safety with future SR transactions. I can't be sure that anything else I order will not receive special scrutiny. You can't be sure either. I had no *specific* reason to be worried about it before. Now I do.

    This guy isn't ruining your reputation, you're doing that yourself.  Calling your customers names shows just how unprofessional you are, and expecting your customers to teach you how to send shit is just fucking ridiculous.  &gt;:(

    These forums exist for a reason.  Everything you need to know to be a good vendor is here, and it is down to YOU to do your homework before you start vending.  You are gambling with other people's freedoms.

    Do you think people will buy from you after they see you acting like this? No, they won't. So stop acting like a child. Right now. That shit won't fly here.

    Learn to pack better. This has been mentioned already. And, almost just as importantly, show some respect. Nobody wants to deal with a jackass when they can deal with a respectable, friendly vendor who already has better prices, product, and shipping methods.

    Good, that's a good thing. You should have researched first before risking other people's safety, but that's in the past. Are you vacuum sealing now? Several times? You should have been using PGP before, but at least you're using it now. Those are two big steps in the right direction.

    Well you have plenty of time to change but you better start treating your customers better. Mostly all new vendors make mistakes and they are certainly understandable. You need to own up to what you did though and try to make things right next time. You aren't going to be very popular if you don't know how to be professional here. I'd start by apologizing to this guy..... ;)

    That's good to hear. There are plenty of people that are willing to help out new vendors if they ask for help. Read as much as you can on the forums, study other vendors shipping methods, and brainstorm ideas from there. Best of luck to you.

    He didn't come here to drag your name through the mud, he came here to ask questions about his safety and spread awareness to protect other buyers. You have every right to message him privately, but we also have a right to know about our vendors and discuss their methods and interactions with buyers publicly. Look over at the rumor mill section, nearly every vendor is discussed, even the new ones. It's a huge and completely necessary part of SR. If you act more respectable towards your buyers and provide good product, good shipping methods, and fair prices, this will benefit you greatly, as people will talk about you on the forums in a good light. The forums are a great way to improve your reputation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look at it this way, you came here, insulted him, acted in an immature fashion, basically telling people to fuck off, and now you seemed to have calmed down and you're acting in a more mature manner and you're trying to improve. Had you not come to the forums, I would have heard you were a bad vendor and avoided you at all costs. But because you and others have all contributed on the forums, I think a lot of people are willing to give you another shot if you can improve your business model.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In short, this thread is a good thing for you as it gives you a second chance, even if you don't see it that way.

    I don't think the purpose of this thread was to badmouth you. OP was concerned about his own safety and, for the safety of others, mentioned you were the vendor so people can hold off on ordering until your shipping methods are improved. I don't blame him, people shouldn't be receiving packages which stink.

    He's not calling you a scammer, he's saying what happened was worse than being scammed. And in my opinion, it is. You risked his safety, he could have faced legal consequences. If you get scammed you just lose some money. What he said was justified, and is his own personal opinion. We know you spent $150, all vendors do, and that's a very small amount of money. You're not being attacked, you're being rated and evaluated fairly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We also don't only care that you didn't vacuum seal. You were acting extremely unprofessional in your first few posts, although that seems to have subsided now, which is good. The fact that you work hard to get your orders out quickly is great. Learn to vacuum seal, learn to ship stealthily, keep shipping out orders like you've been doing, but don't compromise someone's safety just to get an order out quickly. It's great that you give everyone a little extra.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To summarize, nobody is "calling you out" here, the OP was just trying to protect others while asking a question regarding his own personal safety. You made a mistake or two, no big deal, easy fixes. Vacuum seal, act professionally, and you'll be back on track  :)

    Don't forget about the same return address either. Every stereo typical warning I've seen to flag sketchy mail is using the recipients address as the return. Use a random shop address you find on google or something. Don't spoiler our fun and risk our legal situations for a quick buck(no pun intended). Even though I have no intentions to become a vendor, but I can say I as a new buyer. I did  much research, read forums to discover safe vendor and seller practices. Practiced PGP before even placing anything in my cart. Word to the wise, you don't really need to learn anything that's easily referenced. The forums are packed with good advice and solid answers to questions anyone may have. Don't mean to rub it in any further but I that 'paranoid sissy' that take in account of what I'm getting into and the safest way to play it.

    Really? This is what you're going to use the word "snitch" for? I didn't know we had any pre-arranged loyalty with each other that I was supposed to stand by at the risk of other SR buyers like me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Someone recommended I post the seller's name to benefit the community. I did. Someone also recommended I report you to SR. I didn't. I also gave you the link to the forum thread. Since you don't seem to have used the forums for research much, if I didn't give you that link, all of this would be taking place without your knowledge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which probably would have been for the better (for you). I wanted to give you a chance to join the discussion. But all you've done is push buyers away from you with your attitude and immaturity. When you seemed to be "growing up" a bit, I even went and raised my feedback rating from a 1 to a 2. As I said, shipping was fast and the weed was good. Now you've gotten all hot-headed again, and I'd like to make it a 1 again. But I won't.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I didn't say you were a scammer. My phrasing may have been confusing, but I said the only thing worse would be a scammer. The argument made above is that this is worse than being scammed, and now that I think about it, maybe that's true. Your maverick tales of buying and selling weed through the mail are very impressive, but not all your buyers want to be big, strong man like you!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously, you're putting yourself at risk by shipping like this. Who do you think law enforcement cares about more - one buyer among many, or the seller?

    Okay, so when you want to drop the whole acting like a preteen thing, just let us know, because as I said earlier, that shit won't fly here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are not twelve years old. But you are acting like it. Stop. You get upset over the smallest things. Grow up, do what we've suggested, and move the fuck on.

    Your attitude isn't going to help you last long, you're quick to anger, don't think ahead of time, not willing to do proper research before carrying out actions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is Dangerous to the community, all vendors should be able to think for themselves to not only protect themselves but also protect their customers for 2 reasons.  Protecting your customer keeps your customers around and if you have a modicum of humility you don't want your customers getting in trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other is that you dont want your customers to get YOU in trouble, though they do not know who you are, if their package is intercepted, the return address/zip could be investigated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Quick Buds, from one vendor to another, Handle your business professionally otherwise you will not likely see a penny.  The whole reason why the Road exists is to provide people the ability to procure items which our institutions claim to be dangerous or illegal without us making our own deciisouns ourself.  We are supposed to be free people and recieve stuff without majo fear of losing our freedom.  However, We need to trust that our vendors can take the intitiative to protect us to the best of their ability.  You have shown that you did not have the Customer in mind in 2 instances: 1. Your lack of knowledge and ability to even try to protect your customers eg ignoring vaccum sealing, (which if you've read much of the forum anywhere, this should be common sense. 2. You're hostility and childish demeanor when handling a situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Instead of Apologizing to the customer and asking them what you could do to make it better you attacked them.  THEY ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS THEY PAY YOU.  Stop acting like you're all high and mighty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: After rerearding I see that you used the BUYERS address for the Return Address as well.... What kind of scrub are you,  I feel like the people who Message me asking If I take Cash in Mail or paypal could have done a better job.

    Any marijuana vendor that doesn't seal his orders properly is an asshole. Its that simple.

    Just trying to make a quick buck instead of taking the time to do it properly to ensure not only the safety of your customers, but also your own safety.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your customers get busted, that is just gonna bring heat on you. The post mark will tell what Post office it came from, Leo be waiting there for you, and then one day, when they have watched you and took enough photographs and gathered enough evidence, you won't return home from your post office run. Its that simple.

    So many fuck ups on one order. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.

    I'm going to throw my two cents in here because in one of your first couple posts you said you wanted some constructive criticism.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While you are used to selling weed to your friends in real life, this online community is a much different animal. It thrives on and requires professionalism in all aspects of selling and buyers on here are willing to pay a premium for that professionalism. If that seems like too much work for you then you probably won't be a good fit here. There is no room to be sloppy or careless, which is why there is a ratings system and message board with tons of information on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Selling your buddy a 20 sack in real life is not a big deal. The transaction changes hands from one to the next and it's over. On here, you don't know the person on the other side of that transaction. Your product is out there in the open for days exchanging many hands and this increases risk. They could be someone with a family, kids, job and a mortgage to pay. You can't go calling people a sissy because they are upset that you put them at risk. Everyone knows the baseline risk they take from ordering on here but the whole point of good selling practices is to not add on to that risk at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my suggestions to you:
    <br/>
    1.) Fix your attitude - quick.  If you keep acting like a dick you are going to have no one to sell to. Calling people sissies and snitches because your service sucked is totally inappropriate. You are coming across like a mouthy teenager on here - not a good image to have.
    <br/>
    2.) You said you had your vacuum sealer en route - good job. Use it. Seal 2-3x per package.
    <br/>
    3.) SPEND TIME ON THIS FORUM reading about safe selling practices. if you are having trouble finding resources or information about them, let us know and either I or someone else in this thread will be happy to point you in the right direction.
    <br/>
    4.) Use a real return address with a real name in your area. as stated earlier in this thread, one of the top red flags is people using fake names or fake return addresses. It should be in your area, not across the country.
    <br/>
    5.) IMPORTANT - place an order with one or two of the top rated bud sellers and observe their packaging and how they act.
    <br/>
    6.) Make changes, and address those changes in your profile so people know what you have changed. Admit that you had a rough start but outline what you have done to rectify those mistakes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck. Stay open minded and if you need help just ask. We are all a part of this community. The system works well but it is delicate - it doesn't take much for a few tugs at a few threads to unravel the whole thing.

I (not giving away who I am) am one of the more successful sellers on SR, but here is the part no person would ever guess, that I'm so young that I cant even legally get a driver license permit. Im newly 15.  But I am mature enough to conduct business. You seem to be very immature. To put it in nicely, you act like a child and should not be on SR. With the way you stupidly conducted your shipping you probably didn't think about your own safety. You are the perfect target for LE as a seller who doesnt use your brain. I could easily see quick buds logging into SR in the library or packaging the drugs he is sending through the mail at the post office.

    Getting away from this specific instance and talking more generally, has DPR or site developers considered a mandatory waiting period after paying for a vendor's account but before being allowed to list?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, if there was a timed, interactive quiz of some sort based on readily available literature spread around SR and the forums that you had to do at the end of it, to prove you've at least got enough sense about you to pass the test, it could provide buyers with a lot more confidence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If that's at all a desirable thing, I would be happy to help collect all the materials and create the quizzes and if need be, do the code for them in a private sandbox to save some time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And before the "they can cheat by checking the materials at the time they took the test", well that's kind of the point.  It shows you at least KNOW you're supposed to vacuum seal bud, etc. etc.

     I agree with everything you guys said. I think i took this way to personal at first. I wasnt thinking about my buyers safety i was thinking this guy is an asshole for dropping my name in the forum and telling people i suck. But after reading through the forum some more i see how seriously you guys take safety. I'll be honest i wasnt thinking about safety at all i was just thinking about delivering my orders quick.

     Im not a 16 year old girl but i am probably the youngest vendor here. And although it may seem like im an asshole im not. Im just passionate and i dont know how to control my fire sometimes.

    Damn, I am kicking myself now. I was one of the first few people to order from QB. I did complain about the smell but also left a 5. The reason was that I thought that he maybe skipped the vacuum seal on small orders. I had a few coins left after buying a half from another vendor so I got a gram of Blue Dream from QB. It was great weed!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Two weeks go by and I'm needing another half. My regular vendors weren't looking promising so I went back to QB and ordered a half of the BD. I saw that his rating dropped and there were complaints about the packaging. I also saw his reply stating that he bought a sealer. OK, all good then - I placed the order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While doing so, I notice that the item is listed as a "FE Sale". I know not to do FE, I have excellent stats, but I place it anyway because the weed is so good and he is so fast. I messaged him about the whole FE thing but the only reply I got is "your order is ready to go". I figured, fuck it, I'll FE this one time, whatever.... But I cannot! The button is disabled. After some searching, I learn that new vendors cannot get an FE until they have 35 orders or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been messaging him about this but haven't gotten a reply yet. I hope he isn't going to sit on the order until the finalize option is available for me. I'm not 'snitching' you out or anything, QB, if you read this. I just want some communication and think that you shold just ship it instead of making me wait. It is my fault though for going against my better judgement. I've spent a couple thousand dollars on SR so far and haven't had any major problems. I don't want to cause any problems either. However, I do have to add that I still don't see a public key for QB. Sending my addy in the clear was another rule I broke for myself. Blinded by my hunger for drugs... stupid me!

    OK, I just got a reply from saying that I can finalize in 2 days and then he'll ship. This sucks - I busted my ass trying to get my order in early this week so I could be smoking by Thursday or Friday. Now I probably won't get it until Monday. Serves me right for being careless.   :(

    I'm thinking of it but it's already the middle of the week almost so i will not be able to get it any sooner. Also, a cancellation will hurt my stats. I just PMd him again to present a rational argument for shipping it tomorrow. If he chooses not to, it is Ok. I will still give good feedback but I don't think I'd order again. It is a shame though: his stuff is excellent and he is very fast (when not doing FE sales even though he is prohibited from getting an FE due to his ranking).

    I've been trying to find a steady vendor since I joined here. I buy 1 - 2 zips a month. A few started out great but it always goes south at some point.

    He is PROHIBITED from requesting FE, you understand this, yes? He should lose his vendor status for that. If you showed the message with him telling you to FE, or just told customer support about it being mentioned in the listing, he would at least get a warning.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In other words, he either ships it now, cancels your order, or... loses his vendor status. :D At least, I think that's about how it should/will go.

    I can't believe the guys attitude- "Don't be a Sissy" Fuck, I've potentially had my only viable address fucked up by a noob vendor with a g or so of coke sent in a dodgy way. It's no joke plus, I don't know where the guy who got the smelly letter came from, but in some countries, SE Asia , Middle East (and what about the 3 strikes and you're out in USA) it could get you locked up for a long long time, like to see how sissy the vendor is when he's getting his arse hole stretched by a gargantuan deformed 12 inch penis by the cell block bully!!!
