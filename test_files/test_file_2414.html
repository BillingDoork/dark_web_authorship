    Any suggestion on what type of candy pill I could make a copy of an E pill of and repackage for easy shipping to AU? Vacuum seal is not a problem since I will be shipping mostly rcs? I was thinking maybe those candy hearts that have something written on them like I love you.Any suggestions would be great thanks!

    The starbucks mints are a great idea! I always see them at bookstores for like $2 No one really knows their look by memory and a pill with the starbucks logo would easily sell as ecstacy and look normal in this container.

    Depending on the press of the pill Altoids and mini Altoids come to mind. Visit your local sweets shop and look out for mints and sweets sold in small metal tins.  They have a tendency to be reminiscent of more entertaining pills.

    ^^ That guys right! Sending "food" to Australia seems a nightmare.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Number one its organic and would have to be "declared". Also better hope its vacuum sealed and their wrappers cant allow any of the smell of mdma out otherwise dogs would have a field day. Seems like its alerting a lot of attention to yourself and would put the pressure back on the packaging/realism. Just my thoughts.

    While I pause for a second before disagreeing with a drug consuming machine like Ben, 5-htp isn't strictly illegal in AU, it's simply not available for retail locally. Like piracetam and melatonin, you can't legally retail 5-HTP in Australia but there are provisions for importing it for personal use. One restriction is that you may not resell it, nor import it and give it to other people. You are also restricted to importing a 3 months supply in any one instance, although I've not seen an interpretation that says you can't import multiple 3 month supplies of any given allowed compound in a period of less than three months.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5-HTP seems to be opened and inspected perhaps 25% of the time according to the data to which I have access, which is anecdotal rather than definitive: I have no contacts within the relevant government bodies. Supplements in general, when declared as supplements, are inspected perhaps 10% of the time although the country of origin appears to impact the frequency of inspection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I colleague had supplements delivered from Belarus. They were in tablet form, wrapped in a brown paper parcel and tied with jute. Almost like granny sending you a present. They were not inspected. Shipments of nootropics and other similar supplements from the UK are opened and inspected in phases.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unusual tobacco products from Denmark and Sweden are opened perhaps 20% of the time. On X ray these particular products would look very suspicious. Only twice has anyone I have contact with had mints shipped from the UK, and neither shipment was inspected. A colleague was trying to obtain those unusual Victory mint lozenges that were still made with diethyl ether (it's an acquired taste, I'm told, for people who find Fishermen's Friends too ordinary) but apparently they're no longer manufactured.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Somebody else reports importing bacon flavoured mints or some such thing from ThinkGeek, and they were not inspected. This is all anecdotal and is far and away from being a sample size big enough from which to draw any useful conclusions, but you might find it interesting. One might speculate that a retail carton of Altoid tins with the right manufacturer's and retailer's packaging and minty pressed MDMA pills might pass through unscathed. But like Mr Cousins says, as soon as you start looking like actual foodstuffs you're likely to have a success rate lower than shipping ounces of coke.
