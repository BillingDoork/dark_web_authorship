    Yes. If you're really paranoid then order to another address, I've had orders get seized by customs but my ebay, amazon, etc orders were still coming in untouched.

    I don't know... but that doesn't usually stop me answering.

    <br/>
    The best general advice I can give you for when you are unsure about some kind of security/privacy issue is to assume that what you suspect is actually the case, or else very likely, and take appropriate measures from the beginning to ensure that it does not become an issue in the future.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is always better to assume that the authorities have virtually omniscient access to your data. Even though it is often nowhere near the case, and domestic mail does not go through international customs, someone telling you that it is safe will only make you complacent by giving you a greater sense of relative security. By assuming the worst, you will always make sure that you take every precaution you can.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assuming the worst does not mean becoming a paranoid wreck, it just means planning for all eventualities. Murphy's law - if something can go wrong, it will go wrong. Most incorrectly assume that this law means that bad things happen no matter what you do. However the correct interpretation is that if there is even the remotest risk of something going wrong, unless you take measures to mitigate that risk the likelihood of it occurring is quite high given enough time and repetition.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TL:DR: It's never safe to order drugs online, the precise risk is relative and varies hugely. Assume any breech of your security will increase that risk, and any improvements in your opsec will reduce it. Prepare for all potential outcomes, and do not try and forget or trivialize the risk as a coping mechanism against the paranoia it inevitably causes.
