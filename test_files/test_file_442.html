    hey :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just wondering what's the better / safer option to receive a package in germany? Delivery to home address or to Packstation?
    <br/>
    Don't have access to a fake address (any tips about getting one, or how do I get a Packstation under a fake name?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Remember, that the option postlagernd is not available in every post branch.
    <br/>
    I ask myself, how the post is actually working. Do they know who lives at a certain address? If not it would be wise to fake your forename, as someone who send his goods to your address could only know your last name.
    <br/>
    Be creative! Search for free apartments which are unlet, contact the renter to make sure that it's free. Put a fake name on the post box. Maybe send out some letters to that address to see if they get delivered. You should check if you can grab the package without having a key to the house and to the post box. There should live a bunch of people in that building, so you can be more anonymous. OF course that depends on where you live, if it's a (big) city..... perfect!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck

    ps: I got the same problem, pn me if you want some more info

     NEVER EVER your real address and name! Think about this scenario: Do you really want that a criminal dealer has your real ID and address? He can blackmail you, he could even stalk you if you order something domestic. And what will the dealer do, if you get scammed by him and you start writing bad reviews!

    This is what I thought too. If I do Packstation at least the Dealer doesn't know where I live. Well, google my real name and you're almost there.. How about using a fake name with your packstation? Just signed up for a legit one just to test how it works anyway. If I now put a fake name on the order but my real costumer number will they still deliver it regardless? Then I would be fully anonymous to the dealer at least.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, just looking to get some weed for personal use. So even if I get cought it's not the end of my life, so maybe I'm just too paranoid.
    <br/>

    Thanks for the responses so far. Keep them coming :)

    Hi roqii,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am also interested in this.  Currently I receive to fake name/real address as I have a trusted vendor but I would prefer fake name/fake address where I could pickup with minimum risk.  I have an idea that would work in the US but I live in the UK so it would not work here.  Would be interested in sharing idea's on how fake name/fake address would be possible.  I understand apartment with many mailbox would be a good idea but most apartments here have secure entrance or secure mailboxes.

    I'll be driving into Germany from France next year and was going to get a local drop to my hotel, so of course it will be my real name, for the person at the desk would be very suspicious if i didnt. I will be ordering from a very trusted vendor and will have done the order before i leave. Is a hotel drop a good idea? Being from another country, i dont really see any other option...and yeah i wish i had friends over there.. ;)
