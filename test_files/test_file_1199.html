     BREMERTON, Wash. — When Dusty, a 19-month-old black Labrador, walked past a pipe full of marijuana during a recent police search of a house, he was doing exactly what his handler hoped.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The newest drug-sniffing dog on the police force in Bremerton, near Seattle, is one of a few police dogs in Washington state that are not trained to point out pot during searches. Other police departments are considering or in the midst of re-training their dogs to ignore pot as well, part of the new reality in a state where voters last fall legalized marijuana use.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We wanted to train our dog on what was truly illegal substances, that would be heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine,” said Dusty’s handler, Officer Duke Roessel, who added that Dusty nabbed five pounds of meth during that recent search.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Police departments in Bremerton, Bellevue and Seattle, as well as the Washington State Patrol, have either put the dogs through pot desensitization training or plan not to train them for marijuana detection.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The law decriminalized possession of up to an ounce of the drug for individuals over 21 years old. It also barred the distribution and growth of marijuana outside the state-approved system.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Police say that having a K-9 unit that doesn’t alert to pot will lessen challenges to obtaining search warrants because the dog won’t be pointing out possible legal amounts of the drug. Traditionally, dogs are trained to alert on the smell of marijuana, heroin, crack cocaine, methamphetamine and cocaine. They can’t tell which one it is or how much of each there is.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In December, the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys told officers in a guidance memo that dogs that alert on pot face limitations when a search warrant is sought but those are “not fatal to a determination of probable cause.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The group instructed officers to point out that the dog was trained to smell pot and how that is relevant to other information when they seek a warrant, and that a “narcotics-trained canine’s alert will still be relevant to the probable cause equation.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In Pierce County, however, prosecutor Mark Lindquist said authorities are being cautious about the new law because judges might excise the dog sniff from their analysis of probable cause. He’s also not convinced dogs can be re-trained. “We’ll need new dogs to alert on substances that are illegal,” he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In January, the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission removed detecting marijuana from its canine team certification standards. The change doesn’t prohibit trainers from doing so, but it’s not required anymore.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But some police departments aren’t making any changes. And some observers say that a state Supreme Court decision in 2010 in which the justices sided against medical marijuana patients who argued police officers no longer had probable cause to immediately arrest or investigate due to the legalization of medical pot.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Last fall’s legalization law “just made one ounce not a crime for adults. That means that any amount over an ounce is still illegal, growing marijuana is still illegal, selling marijuana is still illegal, passing a joint to somebody is still illegal,” said medical marijuana advocate and attorney Douglas Hiatt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For different reasons, dog trainer Fred Helfers of the Pacific Northwest Detection Dog Association agreed with Hiatt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But having spent 20 years as a narcotics investigator, Helfers said departments who abandoned pot training are having a “knee-jerk” reaction. He said they may miss actual crimes being committed. “What about trafficking? What about people who have more than an ounce?” he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nonetheless, Helfers is helping departments who want to go through the “extinction” training, which he said is a common method to change what substances dogs alert to. It takes about an initial 30 days plus every day reinforcements to modify the dog’s behavior.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Overall, I think there’s still a large amount of agencies on a wait-and-see approach with their dogs,” Helfers said.

     SEATTLE -- The passage of I-502 made things difficult enough for the humans tasked with creating and enforcing the laws for legal marijuana. Now, try explaining the difference between "personal use" and "intent to sell" or the gray area between state and federal law to a dog.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That's why many law-enforcement agencies around the state, including the Seattle Police Department and Washington State Patrol, will no longer be training their drug-sniffing dogs to alert for marijuana.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Moving forward, it makes most sense not to train dogs to alert to marijuana as that would likely lead to unwarranted investigatory detentions of people who are not breaking any law," said Alison Holcomb, author of I-502 and drug policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys sent out a memo advising the state's law-enforcement agencies that narcotics dogs are no longer required to be trained to alert for marijuana in December. And, marijuana was removed from the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission's Canine Performance Standards test in January.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Teaching old drug dogs new tricks
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sgt. Sean Whitcomb said the Seattle Police Department is already taking steps to desensitize its dogs to marijuana through rewards and constant training.
     <br/>
     "Got to keep those sniffers in shape," Whitcomb said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks to some fortuitous timing, the Bellevue Police Department is on the leading edge of removing marijuana from narcotics dogs' vocabularies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In January, the department decided to train its general tracking dog to also detect drugs. During the dog's two months of training, the department specifically taught it not to alert for marijuana, Bellevue Police Lt. Dan Mathieu said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "The ideal is the situation we're in right now," he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Drug-sniffing dogs no longer enough
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, while agencies still have dogs trained to alert for marijuana on patrol, officers will no longer be able to rely solely on dog's alert when determining probable cause for a search warrant, according to the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys memo.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The memo states officers hoping for a search warrant based even in part on a dog's alert will have to inform the judge the dog was trained prior to the legalization of marijuana and present additional evidence, such as a suspect's history of convictions or information from a witness.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Washington State Patrol spokesperson Bob Caulkins said his department will be more specific in its search-warrant affidavits in the future.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the past, a narcotics dog's alert was pretty much all that was needed to get a search warrant, Caulkins said. He said a dog often wasn't even necessary to arrest for investigation of a DUI as long as an officer smelled marijuana in the car.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, Caulkins said officers will have to inform the judge a narcotics dog might be alerting for a legal amount of marijuana, but there are other causes for suspicion, such as the car leaving a known drug house or white powder on the driver's mustache.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Whitcomb said that jibes with standard procedure for the Seattle Police Department's narcotics dogs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “A dog sniff on a car for us has never been a sole reason for getting a search warrant," Whitcomb said. "We’ve always used other factors.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He said the department's process of desensitizing its dogs to marijuana should give anyone transporting the legal amount of marijuana some additional comfort, and they shouldn't fear a search and seizure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, there are still situations where an alert from a narcotics dog would be enough to perform additional searches, for example if the suspect is under 21, according to the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys memo.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And, the requirement of additional evidence shouldn't be seen as too much of burden for officers. According to the memo, probable cause only requires fair probability that evidence of a crime will be found, not certainty. And, search warrants have been upheld in the past even with significant errors from drug-sniffing dogs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     These new requirements also aren't necessarily long-term changes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Caulkins said the Washington State Patrol will be going back to the status quo for search warrants as soon as its current dogs retire and are completely replaced with dogs not trained to alert for marijuana.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The future of pot-sniffing dogs
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But, not all law-enforcement agencies are on board with the changes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Tacoma Police Department spokesperson Loretta Cool said the department will not be changing any of its procedures for training or using narcotics dogs as the possession of marijuana is still illegal under federal law.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That attitude is concerning to the ACLU.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Holcomb said narcotics dogs trained to alert for legal marijuana could extend detention and questioning beyond the scope of reasonable suspicion of a crime. This is especially worrisome because marijuana residue and odor are much more likely to be present on the state's residents than any of the other substances dogs are trained to detect, she said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Pam Loginsky, who wrote the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys memo, said law-enforcement agencies are still free under state law to train their narcotics dogs to alert for whatever substances they desire.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Canines that are trained to alert to marijuana provide valuable information in support of probable cause for a search warrant," Loginsky said.

    Pleasure to read! Nice to see progressive action thanks to state dependence. As a Canadian I have a method of hiding harder substances where a bag of weed in kept in the open, the weed may be found but the well-sealed personal amount of hard shit will be concealed nicely within a dank smelling container, with the expectation  that the dogs reaction to the weed is blown off as residual weed smell.
