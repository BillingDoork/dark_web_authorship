    You know when you get spam in the mail it often says something like "John Smith Or Current Resident".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone thought about doing this or already tried it?  It seems like it would be easy to use a fake name and then if the package was caught you could easily deny it was meant for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm guessing this might not work to well for International mail and probably won't work for packages.  But it seems like it could work for anything fitting in just an envelope.

    Not a bad idea IMO as long as the envelope looks generic, however you need to keep in mind those "or current resident" mailers are bulk mailed through the PO and everyone in the neighborhood gets them, so it *might* look weird if only one house was getting it.

    That's a good point.  It could draw more attention to it if it was the only one like that.

    I would never try that theory out for a delivery name.  You want your mail to 'blend in' with the rest of your mail.  Any different names can raise a red flag.  Try and be a conformist and blend in with the rest of society when sending and receiving mail.

    What exactly would you gain by this? The police/customs aren't going to believe the letter wasn't intended for you just because it doesn't have your name on it, they're not stupid. The ONLY relatively smart idea would be if you recently moved and you put the previous owners name (make sure the previous owner doesn't get his mail redirected or it will be directed to him, you can test this by sending a test letter to yourself with the name). Now you see THIS would be a good idea because the police would assume (as long as you're not a total twat and look like a typical drug user) that the letter was intended for him/her and not you.

    Many times the mailman knows the name of everyone on the route and will not deliver to the "wrong" name. There are many exceptions to this but i would say always test a new name at least twice to see if its delivered before trusting your precious sr shipment to it. I have a fake name i've used many times and they do deliver.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as le goes, they have to prove you ordered it or show by your words or actions that you knew what was in it or expected it. Otherwise someone could send you drugs in an envelope designed to draw attention and get you busted. What i do is let it sit by the door for a few hours. If anyone comes knocking and asking questions about did i get anything i didn't expect, i will say yes and hand it right over. All you lose is the shipment and they do not ask those questions unless they already know the answer. Mark it "return to sender" just for added credibility. If you deny getting it they have probable cause to bust in or at least get a warrant. If the packet has been opened and you have powder under your nose, say hello to bubba.

    Sometimes small businesses or charities don't use bulk pre-sort because:
    <br/>
    1.) They don't know how.
    <br/>
    2.) They don't want to bother doing the paper work and pre-sorting.
    <br/>
    3.) It's cheaper based on the low volume of mail they're sending.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Somebody else said that "Current Resident" mail is usually sent to every house. Often, this is not the case. Think about that publisher clearing house envelope your grandma gets... The 30-somethings across the street don't get that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think "Current Resident" would be O.K. for ENVELOPES.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Current Resident" on a PACKAGE would be very very odd. At that point, you might as well write "Illicit substance contained within" in big block letters as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree with sunny1 that LE have to PROVE that you ordered the package. If this wasn't the case, think of how easy it'd be to frame somebody for a drug rap.

    In Europe, at least in my experience, it is hit or miss.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some postmen abide strongly with the rule of "if the name isnt on the box then I dont put it in".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However in the same country some have been much more lax. Both examples were in apartments, but the one I am in now will deliver anything. There are at least 7 different names delivered to this mailbox. 2 of them I am responsible for.

    Agreed. This concept seemed ok in the beginning, but quickly after this thread was started the short comings of this idea have come to light.

    I've been doing that, I've also used names that don't even exist and they come trough. Had to sign for one the other day which had me freaking a bit. Initially I didn't open the package cause my tweaker mind imagined my door busting in that afternoon, and me, with pipe in mouth, insisting they let me cool the oil properly before i "put my hands up"....then the itch over powered my tweaker mind and I sucked down a big fat one :)
