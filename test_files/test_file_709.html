    Hey guys, I just placed my first "larger than normal" order for 50 PARTYFLOCK pills from Schizofreen, strong MDMA. I've ordered from Schizo twice before so I have total trust in his packaging, service, and product, I just have a question. Schizo is sending the package tracked, just how I want it, and told me to wait a week before tracking. He also said to not use Tor when doing so, because it could potentially raise a red-flag. I plan to wait a week then head to a coffee shop and use their wifi to track my package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question is about the delivery. Since it's tracked, I'll probably have to head to the Post Office to sign and pick it up. I'm not a nervous, sketchy looking person, nor do I get that way in a situation like this, but my friend told me something and I want someone elses opinion. My friend, who introduced me to SR, told me that if the package looks opened or tampered with when I pick it up, I should examine it and claim that I didn't expect this to come. Should I do this? Are there any signs to look for on the package that justify me NOT picking it up? Thanks.

    if you have ordered from him before and nothing happened then you should be fine,however if it is not in your box and they ask you to sign for it since it is a tracked package then you should not even attempt to track it, that way if something goes wrong they cannot prove you attempted to track it,if its late ask the vendor to track it for you.just go ahead and sign for it,dont act suprised just look kinda suprised cuz they will probably read your face. but if its not your usual time to pick up bills/catalogs then y the hell are you at the po box anyways? c what im getting at? but usually when i get intl tracked mail then i never have to sign for it. and if they did intercept it it would be at customs and probably not your post office.
