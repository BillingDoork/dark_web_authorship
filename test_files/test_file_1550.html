    Hello there, i know, this for sure has been discussed a lot here, i know but i cant find good threads.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, i want to smuggle 5kg cocaine or less, but not less than 2kg in airplane, just 1 flight, ive seen some methods like making it liquid, then solidify and thats it, on a really random vid, to give an example, what comes in mind guys? i know that around here must be some Disguise Masters to smuggle, can gimme some ideas?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok, lets take out the plane, just the smuggling, could be on BUS, now what? By ground, in a VAN, a Car, whatever, that give us a lot of other chances to do this.

    The real question is why would you want to? In this Age is it not much safer to post it? Instead of walking aboard a plane with kilos of drugs. Those days are sadly over, It probably still could be done in some way or another, However more people would be willing to help with ways to send it anonymously, Can i be first to say.
    <br/>
    Break it down into smaller amounts dont send kilos in one go, its stupid. Send them to different addresses packaged differently from different places.  use Vacuum sealers and Mbbs. Im no expert but thats all widely availible information

    I say the following because LE is already aware of this technique, it is difficult to find and stop regardless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When in Mexico I learned of a method that Cartels were using, they were fusing tequila with heroin or coke, the tequila would then be sealed and boxed and imported into the US, stateside someone would separate the tequila from the drugs through some kind of distillation method and viola. Probably the most advanced stealth system I've ever encountered but it requires chemistry knowledge and you prob would get looks if you tried going through the airport with multiple bottles of liquor.

    There was one method I saw in a movie, that was genius to be honest..... They dissolved the cocaine and then let the liquid soak up into white t-shirts and dry, and then packaged them into smell-proof, clear bags. They had entire trucks full of these t-shirts soaked in coke. Completely x-ray proof, dog proof(if smell-proof is good enough), and the works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They used this to smuggle 1000+ kilos across the country. When the shirts reached their destination, the shirts were then soaked in liquid and the cocaine was extracted and then the liquid was evaporated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't be surprised if this was practiced in the real world. For those of you wondering, I believe it was in a Steven Segul movie. It's a genius idea really.

    You saw the film exit wounds, back when that film came out I don't think it was possible however chemists are becoming more and more clever. They have managed to somehow to hide coke in rolls of plastic film, not like cling film but something more thicker than that. The dog caught it, but looking at, you never ever in your life suspect that. Guys you need to be watching those nothing to declare or border security programs on TV, it's amazing how much techniques are exposed when sending with mail or through an airport and most of the time, they stumble upon these things by chance, like oh he doesn't look right, or oh why did he come into the country with such little money, etc.

    Yuo would get coke out of south america by post ever, each package is marked red from that destination and will be extra scrutinized when it lands. Best bet is plane or bus. using bees wax condoms and cling film to make up pellets like we do for our hash or  you can use techniques for tricking x-ray if yuo use two times vac seal and 1 MBB wash the package you should be good for the dogs. We´ve smuggled many many kilos of hash and weed. from africa to europe and the middle east. using everything from UAV´s to eating eggs to making packages look like other items under x-ray

    Hahaha, the post of MendoHashMan is great!!
    <br/>
    Exactly what I thought - but you must take some precautions!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can still use the airport, just need a person that travels with enough money to spend a few days in the arriving country (and is not depending on the cash for smuggling)!!
    <br/>
    Also you need a good reason why to go there (not visiting a friend who pays for accommodation!!), reservations for hotel etc should be done a few weeks before, so that it doesn´t look like a rashly action! Look for some sightseeing points, etc... you want to visit - take a travelguide with!
    <br/>
    The best would be if that person is working and earns own money!
    <br/>
    Be careful with clothes, bags, etc..it should never get in contact with any illegal substance!!
    <br/>
    ...and of course it should be a person that stays cool when coming to the customs (maybe get a valium)!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can´t take enough precautions to stay safe!!

    hmmm...this has me thinking. I have heard about the liquid but i think all liquids have to be like 4 oz containers or less. And with that many keys it would be a shit ton of little bottles. You'd definitely raise some flags. Some cartels were sewing it inside of puppies and shit but that is FUCKING SICK and I'd wish you to hell for such a thing. I love puppies. The Tshirts sound cool but you'd probably lose product and run the risk of screwing up entirely. I think really the best thing is to travel via car and have spotters. I wouldn't risk the flight personally.

    Have the mule walk around with a huge butt plug for a week before the run and they will walk normal! DO NOT JUST DROP IT IN YOUR BAG!!! Most people don't just shove it up their ass if they have a lot, they swallow it in a bunch of big capsules too, just be sure it's packed in something that isn't toxic and will withstand the stomach acid, also consider the leingth of the plane trip. A lot of mules OD because a capsule breaks and they suddenly have 14+ grams of pure coke in their stomach! Get 3-5 girls to fill their stomach and holes and hope for the best, put em on different planes, don't tell them there are others, pay well when she delivers, never seen her before if she is busted or dies that's how the pros do it! Cold blooded and dangerous business, but 1 girl should be able to carry 500+ grams of coke according to a friend that used to do this 6 times a year! But I don't recommend, it is a good way to die or go to jail for a really long time!

    I know they dont xray everyone. I was in amsterdam this year, And i didnt have anything on me. However out of 4 lanes at security only one had a body scanner the others were just metal detectors, There were no dogs, I have been there 4 times and there was never any dogs. I found it very easy to avoid the queue for the body scanner, I was put into the body scanner line, and for intrest i decided to swap lanes, and managed it no problem. No problem at all. Keep calm. Act normal. Smile and chat away

    I know for a fact you can put some mdma capsules into a vitamin bottle mixed with the vitamins or something and you will be fine. As for in its pure form im not 100% mate.

    Yeah it's possible. :) Also, I have a friend who got a cruise, got off in a certain country and decided to buy some Pot when presented with th opportunity. He just put it in a MBB and put that in his shirt pocket, Put a sweatshirt on over it and walked aboard the ship, everyone got searched etc, They never told him to take his jumper off, Now that i think about it, Have you ever been asked to take your jumper off at customs even in an airport? Jackets yes, But not the jumper/sweatshirt.
    <br/>
    holy shit, I had that smuggle guide on my links to deepnet services for newbies guide i recognize it straight away, has it been taken down?

    Okay, how about (personal amounts) stuffing your headset with cocaine, mdma or whatever? I always get them straight through without anyone even looking at it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another idea would be to bring a little toothpaste tube, and have it slightly "modified". It can be split in three parts, paste, stuff, paste, and still be fully working. When you're through you can just cut it open with a knife?

    You should buy a really good sealed shower bag and just stuff it inside toothpastes , After you have done 'fixing' them wash them good with alcohol , be sterile as much as possible don't let any of the stuff touch your bag, If you ask me it's all about how much confidence you have when your passing , if you start sweating or look weird they will notice you and search you.

    In a car, your best bet is to vac seal/mbb it w.e and stuff it in your door panels. IDK about borders but I highly doubt they would make anyone open door panels unless they were tipped off and there is SHIT TONS of room in there.

     There was one method I saw in a movie, that was genius to be honest..... They dissolved the cocaine and then let the liquid soak up into white t-shirts and dry, and then packaged them into smell-proof, clear bags. They had entire trucks full of these t-shirts soaked in coke. Completely x-ray proof, dog proof(if smell-proof is good enough), and the works.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They used this to smuggle 1000+ kilos across the country. When the shirts reached their destination, the shirts were then soaked in liquid and the cocaine was extracted and then the liquid was evaporated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I wouldn't be surprised if this was practiced in the real world. For those of you wondering, I believe it was in a Steven Segul movie. It's a genius idea really.

    A lot of guys coming back from Colombia these days.  It is now a huge tourist destination.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.)  Colombian authorities rarely Xray people's stomach leaving the country
    <br/>
    2.)  You will get patted down 1-2 times before getting on the plane
    <br/>
    3.)  Once on the plane it's usually a 3hr flight to Miami
    <br/>
    4.)  Miami customs rarely sends you to secondary inspection
    <br/>
    5.)  Sometimes on the way out of customs they will have a dog right by the exit to see if the K9 picks anything up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Therefore, swallowing would be the safest bet just make sure that it doesn't open up in your stomach!

    1. Take drugs and carefully vacuum seal into a cylinder shape. The rounder the better. This is only for space reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Clean off vacuum seal packaging with a solvent (for cocaine it would be alcohol)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. Insert cleaned vacuum sealed bag into a mylar bag, best without corners and heat seal that. Than, do the same. Clean with alcohol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. I prefer coconut oil, but many will swear on Astroglide. Lube up cylinder shaped mylar bag, and carefully insert into anus. Best position to do this is on knees. Keep shoving it  in your anus until your prairie dogging it. Your anal cavity can take a lot more then you would imagine. I kilo of cocaine is easily done. Think about the profit, not the discomfort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Before full insertion, lube the small area not yet consumed by your anus. The reason for this is so when you remove it, everything comes out easily.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5. Profit.
