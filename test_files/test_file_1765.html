    So I go into the post office to pick up the new Prepaid Priority Flat Rate boxes and of course the bitch there has no clue to what I'm talking about and says I'm wrong and that there's only the free ones in the lobby. I told her that it's listed right there on the USPS website. Does anyone know if they can be bought at a retail location or was this clerk just an idiot?

    The usps site says prepaid flat rate can only be purchased online and that it includes your return address on all the boxes, so this isnt much different than buying labels online. Actually it looks like they just slapped a label on all the boxes you buy, its not like the boxes themselves somehow are worth their weight in gold.

    who uses stamps? like everyone. if you are worried about getting tracking then use click n ship for business and slap stamps on the generated label. just run it in a vm and restore the snapshot often so you can reset the registration info (if that ends up on the label idk). Using prepaid cards and online postage is a bad idea (i admit i was looking to do this a while ago but in the end it just wasnt worth it).

    Can you pm me or something? Do you have to set up click n ship via a proxy? You would have to, right? Running it on a VM wouldn't hide your internet connection when it registers.

    Best thing is just to use public wifi when doing any sort of online shipping stuff. VPN may be traceable back to you and tor is a big no. The VM is just so you can reset the program and reregister as often as you want. You could just reinstall the program but i dont know what sort of traces it leaves.

    Using Click n' Ship for Business is no safer than using Click n' Ship because it is an application that requires you connect to the usps.com server.  You won't be able to mask your IP address via TOR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone who doesn't want to use postage stamps probably shouldn't be mailing out drugs in the mail in the first place.  You do know it's illegal and if caught you'll most likely go to Federal prison..right?
