    I'm thinking about either getting 1GR of MDMA, Ketamine or DMT shipped to my home address in Australia. MDMA prices are off the roof in Australia, so ordering domestically would be pointless when I could get it for the same price offline. But ordering it on SR, would be 1/10-1/8 of Aussie street price.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I order 1GR of MDMA from someone like EazyJet, Chemical Brothers or pills from Aakoven and have it shipped to my normal home address with a real name. Am I posing big risk to myself? From what I've seen people are saying just use a real name and address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seeing it is such a small amount, do you think customs would really find it? Because you would think customs have bigger things to look for the 1GR of MDMA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If customs did pick it up, how much shit could I be in if, I just completely deny it and say I never ordered that and someone must have sent it to me by mistake.

    Holly shit, seriously? Just for 1GR of MDMA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok I am definitely not risking this shit if that's how bad the punishment is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What if it was DMT or Ket? Same punishment? Wouldn't it be nearly impossible to get caught shipping DMT, it would be such a small amount, and I don't think there is any Sniffer Dogs looking for DMT.

    May I know why, is it wrong to assume that Australian customs wouldn't be looking for DMT. I have seen many people with similar queries to mine. I don't see what I have done to show I shouldn't be on this site.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, everyone has to start somewhere. Yes I'm a noob to using SR and have never made a purchase, but I have done a fair amount of research and looking around. And I am just posing this question to any other Aussie users who can say whether they have gotten there shit successfully from international sellers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After doing more looking around after this question, it seems a lot of Aussies haven't had huge problems shipping internationally, and have said if it got picked up, they would just deny everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am just trying to confirm this, and get some real info from Aussies who have bought international, and any tips they have.

    The punishment would depend on what state you are in. In victoria, getting caught with more than 2 grams of MDAM is considered dealing. there are different max quantities for different drugs
    <br/>
    I myself haven't had ordered anything on SR yet, but I've ordered RCs from other sites that got through without a problem.
    <br/>
    But yes take precautions, i hear our customs is the biggest bunch of bitches in the world

    Cheers for that. I wont be ordering more then 1GR, I have gained some more confidence in ordering O/S, from some reading I have been doing in the past hour or so. I think the guy who said it was an 825K Fine to Life imprisonment, is stupid, or thinks I will be ordering a lot more then I will.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And mind sharing any good sites to buy RC's off, that ship to Australia. Would love to try order some MXE if it's still available on RC sites.

    1. Where would I get it shipped too...? I heard that you are better off just using your own Address instead of vacant houses. And a PO Box is too much hassle for me, and they are registered to your name anyway, so I don't see how it makes a difference.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Like I said, I have no where else to ship it too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. I don't have other names, and ID's, I'm not some huge criminal with a collection of various ID's. I'm just an average guy on SR to get some drugs for personal use. I don't even see how ID's come into play here. There is no point in the process of ordering drugs in which my ID would come into play. Also getting in trouble for Identity Fraud is a lot worse then getting in trouble for 1GR of MDMA getting shipped to you. And I have now read many times, to just use your real name when ordering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And seriously man, learn how to spell.

    I always advise that no one can prove you ordered. Anyone can send anything to anyone else without permission. How can you get convicted on that? If so I would send crack to all my enemies and tip off the cops.

    Use your home address and you'll be fine. If the order is not tracked and  just uses standard  Int. mail, use a fake name as names are not linked to addresses in Aust unlike countries such as the USA. Truthfully speaking, 1 gram is a small, personal quantity that shouldn't raise an eyebrow if vac. sealed and stealthily packed. Choose a vendor very carefully and based on my own experience, I would order from somewhere other than The Netherlands. That is solely based on my personal experiences here on SR but it will be entirely a decision for you to make and be comfortable with. I have full confidence in that if you research a vendor carefully and review their most recent feedback scores and comments and like what you see, pull the trigger so to speak and you'll never look back! Good luck with it all. :)

    You don't need to put your name on the item.
    <br/>
    Other countries where your name is linked to your address, will be a red flag for customs if a package under someone else's name gets posted there.
    <br/>
    But in Aus there is no link to who lives where. Use a fake name imo.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another thing is most vendors ask you to Finalize Early, and once that happens you need to trust that they will post the item.
    <br/>
    Sometimes they don't post it and say they did, take your money and blame customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Too easy and you can't prove anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pretty much every seller wants you to FE if you're new and you're in Aus.
    <br/>
    The only thing I can recommend is buy from a trusted seller, and buy from UK.
    <br/>
    Ivory mdma may not be as cheap as some NL sellers but UK and Aus share a common language, and have a lot of family and friend ties.
    <br/>
    UK is not flagged as a drug import country like NL and Canada.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also I'm pretty sure I got selectively scammed by easyjet, as many people have not received their packages from him, not just myself. But again, hard to tell if he scammed me or customs took my goods.

    I've never ordered from Ivory, but I've read that his packaging isn't 'border-proof', so to speak. If it's opened, 'game over' (whether it's customs or the people you live with). Still, there are heaps of poms in Aus (= plenty of post coming from there &amp; UK mail doesn't come under scrutiny as much), Ivory has a high success rate, he vacuum-seals the product, and supposedly makes it look like a professional business letter (it should blend in, past customs' letter profiling or whatever they do).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, be safe and have fun!  ;)

     Sorry I'm still a bit new to all this. I'm assuming a love letter is a letter from customs saying they got my shit?

    Yeah they rarely send them now cause I guess it's not in their budget but pretty much a love letter is a letter from customs saying something like "Hey, we found illegal shit in a package being sent to you and it was confiscated kbye"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I only got one once and that was a long time ago but now you rarely even see them being sent but I'm in the states so I don't know about Aus.

     I've never ordered from Ivory, but I've read that his packaging isn't 'border-proof', so to speak. If it's opened, 'game over' (whether it's customs or the people you live with). Still, there are heaps of poms in Aus (= plenty of post coming from there &amp; UK mail doesn't come under scrutiny as much), Ivory has a high success rate, he vacuum-seals the product, and supposedly makes it look like a professional business letter (it should blend in, past customs' letter profiling or whatever they do).

    Thanks, after all the reading and research I've done in the past day or two, I'm pretty sure I'm going to use Ivory. It looks like he packages it well, and it will most likely get here. I'm less paranoid about customs finding it now that I've read some more info about it.

    One other question. I have about a $80 budget for this MDMA. And it looks like the value of bit coins is going up by the minute. Just say I woke up tomorrow and bitcoins were worth $2 more then they are now, and wanted to go buy them at the bank. Do the prices on SR automatically adjust to the current BitCoin exchange rate, so they are always the same. Or does stuff get more expensive as BitCoins go up?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wish I had bought mine when they were $8 each, now they are about $12 each. Do they usually fluctuate like this a lot? And whats the lowest-highest they usually get.

    Most vendors use hedging so the prices should stay the same no matter what the value of the coin is whether it's $5 or $16. I think during checkout it will tell you if it is hedged or not.

    Oh, I thought hedging was for when you have purchased something the cost gets saved as dollars in escrow instead of Bitcoin. So if the price dramatically rises or lowers while the order is being shipped, one or the other person doesn't lose money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I'm assuming the word hedging applies to the seller keeping there prices on par while the Bitcoins exchange rate fluctuate?

    Yeah it's good protection for both the seller and the buyer so it's rare for a vendor to do unhedged orders but some take the risk  ;)

    As far as I know from doing quite a bit of reading. For MDMA, order from Ivory, his MDMA crystal costs $126 for 2 grams, and hes from the UK, so customs wont be as suspicious, unlike a package from the Netherlands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For LSD I would go with EnterTheMatrix, he is an Aussie seller, and is known to have the best LSD on SR. The fact that hes Aussie and it's only tabs, the odds of it being seized are almost impossible.

    I haven't bought off these two yet, but they are definitely the best options for what you are looking for. I'm sure about Coke and Speed, as I don't really have any interest in these drugs. Do some more reading around on the forums till you find someone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's only 2 Grams of anything, they will most likely just send you a love letter or do nothing. But you said you have been caught in possession of MDMA, so I'm not sure.

    Thanks for the vendor listings! I was looking at Ivory for the MDMA and I haven't even looked up the LSD yet. I'm not too worried about it anyway because of the size and the lack of smell.
    <br/>
    I don't use speed / coke very often because of the outrageous cost of it here. Buying 2gm of the stuff online will last me months.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buying drugs online still just seems out of this world, and risky...

     I'm looking at getting 2gm MDMA, 2 gm Coke, 2gm speed and some LSD, all from seperate sellers.
     <br/>
     Coke &amp; MDMA is 1/4 of the price the dealers I know sell for, and speed is about 10 times cheaper. Plus I'm sick of paying $20 for the shitty pills going around now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Does anyone from Australia have any good sellers that have good success rates with Australia shipping?
     <br/>
     Also, any info on anyone who has been caught?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I will most likely send to another name at my address. That way I can deny everything if it gets seized.
     <br/>
     But surely they wouldn't execute a search warrant on my house if they found 2gm of something?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I CANNOT risk my house getting searched. I have 1/2 pound weed and also have previously been caught in possession with MDMA.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     How should I go about this?

    Nice one, giving the coppers info on your current stash, and who you plan on ordering from, and your previous arrest record.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are either a cop or just a nervous first-time buyer. If the former, fuck yourself with a chainsaw; if the latter, READ THE FORUMS, and make a decision. It's drugs via mail, mate. Not a t-shirt off eBay. Take the plunge. If you have half a pound of cheeba, you have the capable brain matter to think for yourself. Or, you're a copper.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are so many Aus drug threads it makes me sick. Fucking hell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And here comes the neg karma......

    Point taken... I am nervous because this is new to me &amp; there is a significant risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not too worried about posting on here, as it's anon. I can't see a problem with posting seller details here either...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think I'll wait a bit and get it sent to a neighbours house under a fake name, and check their mail every day while they are at work :-D

    I'm on 6 weeks holiday, so this could work for me.

    So, now we also know that you're on a 6-week holiday... either long service leave or gardening leave from a finance-type/real estate job. And your record. And your stash. Kinda narrows it down, no? Australia may be a big place, but there is fuck all people here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, Tor is anonymous, but it's not the be-all and end-all of anonymity. Bitcoin blockchains, postal addresses, arrest records, declaring stashes, work holiday times, not using USB bootable OS's, etc all add up to one big jigsaw puzzle picture.. of you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I said in an earlier post, the cops use pieces of info, like a jigsaw puzzle, to put together a case. Bit by fucking bit. And the fuckers have all the time in the world on their side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless you're a descendant of the Packer, Murdoch or Rinehart clans, you better have enough clean, free dosh to keep fighting the charges with Barristers and QC's on your side to keep you outta lockup, if your little import experiment fucks up somehow (I cannot imagine WHY!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not being a dickhead, and I can appreciate you're nervous, if you're not a cop. Take my posts however you want; i'm trying to keep this golden thing called Silk Road available to Aussies for as long as possible.

    Just trying to help, ya know? Like Aussies usually do with each other? You just admitted that you're a newbie that CANNOT risk having their house searched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I just think you're a copper, since you'll be using 'appropriate encryption methods'... why ask so many questions if you're so sure you won't get busted?
    <br/>

    Whatever, so much for trying to be helpful.

    And believe me or not, I'm not a cop. I'm just very cautious about using SR to minimise the chance of getting caught (probably unnecessarily cautious). I will use encryption because I have read on other forums that it is recommended. I don't even know if I'll end up using SR, at least not for a while. I'll think about it for a while, but so far I haven't done anything illegal on here.

    U new aussies want some great advice? here goes....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First it would help all of the aussie community if u stop making stupid threads drawing more attention to aus... from the feds and the selective scammers who can smell your money a mile away, fresh aussie meat...
    <br/>
    Discontinue using this thread and get in the current aus shipping thread like you should have done in the first place...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second READ READ READ... once you think you have read enough think again.... READ MORE!! KNOWLEDGE IS KEY TO YR SUCCESS HERE SO DO YR HOMEWORK.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Third dont ask what vendors u should use in public.... do yr research as everyone else does and take a risk... as everyone else does..
    <br/>
    and if you arnt prepared to lose money due to scams or lost packages u should have a good think and ask yrself is this place right for me? if the answer is no then you should save yrself any hassle and delete tor straight away....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fourth again if you are scared of being busted for a federal crime ie importing drugs then ask yrself again is this place right for me? if you answer no then delete tor straight away.
    <br/>
    Yes there have been ppl busted so think smart do yr research and stay safe...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you answered yes to the third and fourth question "is this place right for me" then welcome aboard..... maybe it should have one and two but owell...
    <br/>
    If you follow the real simple advice i have just given, you should do just fine....

       And believe me or not, I'm not a cop. I'm just very cautious about using SR to minimise the chance of getting caught (probably unnecessarily cautious). I will use encryption because I have read on other forums that it is recommended. I don't even know if I'll end up using SR, at least not for a while. I'll think about it for a while, but so far I haven't done anything illegal on here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thanks again for your help though. I do appreciate it!

      Matrix,
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Sorry for the super slow reply. I just saw this post.
      <br/>
      I will give it a try soon. I still haven't bought LSD off SR. I've never tried it, and to be honest I'm a little scared.
      <br/>
      I will make a purchase soon :-)
      <br/>

      Glad to help.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Always good to err on the side of caution, though.

     +1 Paddy, great advice!

     I must say, you beat us to reply to this one. To all the newbies, please be really careful how much you accidentally reveal about yourself on a public forum.
     <br/>

     As Paddy said, they can simple piece together bits of the jig saw.

    Haven't you seen Boarder Security recently? they have thousands of sniffer dogs patrolling the Sydney postal delivery center now, combine that with the new federal government off shore processing for anyone caught using SR and you will be fucked mate believe, best not risk it I say, those sniffer dogs are bang onto the DMT too, they love that shit and you will get caught.

        What if it was DMT or Ket? Same punishment? Wouldn't it be nearly impossible to get caught shipping DMT, it would be such a small amount, and I don't think there is any Sniffer Dogs looking for DMT.

    Sarcasm is hard to identify through non-verbal communication.
    <br/>
    Although the :-P face helps though. Haha

    And yes, customs seems to fail in what they are trying to do, which I think is fantastic!
    <br/>
    Programs like AFP &amp; Border Security, etc are obviously set up for no other reason than to frighten people.

    I dunno if anyone else here has ordered speed / MDMA from O/S, but there is a new vendor called Powerade, who I suspect is MrFireUK with a new vendor account.
    <br/>
    MrFire was good to me, so I'll be trying Powerade out!

      I'm looking at getting 2gm MDMA, 2 gm Coke, 2gm speed and some LSD, all from seperate sellers.

      Coke &amp; MDMA is 1/4 of the price the dealers I know sell for, and speed is about 10 times cheaper. Plus I'm sick of paying $20 for the shitty pills going around now.
      <br/>

      Does anyone from Australia have any good sellers that have good success rates with Australia shipping?

      Also, any info on anyone who has been caught?

      I will most likely send to another name at my address. That way I can deny everything if it gets seized.

      But surely they wouldn't execute a search warrant on my house if they found 2gm of something?

      I CANNOT risk my house getting searched. I have 1/2 pound weed and also have previously been caught in possession with MDMA.

     Nice one, giving the coppers info on your current stash, and who you plan on ordering from, and your previous arrest record.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You are either a cop or just a nervous first-time buyer. If the former, fuck yourself with a chainsaw; if the latter, READ THE FORUMS, and make a decision. It's drugs via mail, mate. Not a t-shirt off eBay. Take the plunge. If you have half a pound of cheeba, you have the capable brain matter to think for yourself. Or, you're a copper.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There are so many Aus drug threads it makes me sick. Fucking hell.

    No offence mate, but with a question like that you are asking to be trolled. If you kick a concrete wall hard with bare feet, will it hurt?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay safe, always. When dealing with illegal substances 'you can never be too paranoid' is my motto, regardless of amount. Here are some simple steps I adhere to...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Always use Tor, for everything
    <br/>
    2. Learn how to use PGP, its your best friend
    <br/>
    3. When dealing with vendors, always encrypt your messages
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For shipping
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Never use your home address or your real name
    <br/>
    2. If you do repeat orders, change up the destination (frequency is up to you)
    <br/>
    3. Wait a few days to a week if you can, before collecting/opening package
    <br/>
    4. If the tracking says 'held by customs for release' or any other such message, count your loses and move on
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australian customs is not the big bad machine people make it out too be. They are far too concerned about large amounts coming into the country, especially from China, and with the way most vendors on SR package their merchandise and their shipping origin, I'm sure you'll have little to worry about. I know of friends that have received numerous packages coming into Australia over the last 3 years and have never had any problems. One good thing to know once you've decided to go ahead with any transaction, is the legal amounts of any substance (i.e possession, supply etc).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck, stay safe
