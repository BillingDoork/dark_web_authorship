    okay so today i got the dcn of a package that should have arrived yesterday. when i track the package it says it was in the post office in my town yesterday morning and out for delivery then it says its undeliverable as addressed. can i call the post office and have them hold it for me or is there anything at all i can do to prevent having it returned to the sending address?

    I wouldn't do that if I were you, there is no telling why it is suddenly undeliverable.

    You could have had some idiot substitute mail carrier (carriers do get days off believe it or not) that didn't know what they were doing.  I would recommend giving it a couple of days, they should try again.  If you still don't receive it you may just need to let this one go.

    Oh and if you used a fake name you are probably never going to see it.

    I've been shipping legal products (not through silk road) for quite some time now and can offer you a bit of insight.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Usually when it says undeliverable, it means that you misplaced a few digits on the zip code your address is registered with at the postal office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Meaning: the post office that has it is not the one that delivers it, so they have to re-ship it to the right one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had this happen to me one time, package was supposed to come Friday, ended up being "undeliverable", I called, and they explained that it would show up Monday-Tuesday, it did.

    I had something similar happen.  A number was transposed on my zip code (either my fault or vendors..anyway) and the post office kicked it around a number of times and eventually someone looked at it closely and it was delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It should come eventually.  I did take a leap and called. The order was for something unlikely to be detected.  They were not helpful, could never locate the package for me.  It just happened to be delivered after some time.
