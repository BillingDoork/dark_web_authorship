    I just transferred to a new public state university (in the US) and don't have a trusted person whose house I can get any orders mailed to and was wondering where I should get my first order shipped to. The only real options I have are getting it shipped to the university or making a P.O. box and getting it shipped there. The nearest ups store is a town away and I'd have to take a bus to access it and I'm not really keen on doing that for receiving orders unless I have to. My question is which of those first two options is safest and is there anything that I should know about making my first order? I'd be ordering pills, lsd, hash and maybe weed or mdma. Thank you all so much for any advice and help that you can give, I really appreciate it. :)

    Bigger cities usually have places that will let you ship your mail to them and you pick it up for a flat fee.  Some are advertised and some are word of mouth. There was a few gas stations and wireless phone stores in the not so good part of town where you could do it. You should be able to find a place that actually does it as a business or side business and is advertised.  A lot of Indian people who own small shops will do this. At least in my experience that is who I have seen.
