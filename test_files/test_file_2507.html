    I didnt fully read the buyer's guide like i should have before purchasing and used a fake name for shipping... I made an order well over a month+ ago and have had no product come in yet, it was pointed out to me this is almost certainly because i used a fake name thinking that would secure my identity but didnt think about the red flags it may raise within the shipping process... Has anybody else made this error? I've tried contacting the vendor to inform him of what i did and to see if there is any way we can fix this but i have not had a response, i'm probably just going to have to purchase another shipment, aren't I?

    Don't feel bad we all make stupid mistakes, just make sure to not make it again.  ::) Hopefully you've spent some time reading up on security, safety methods, etc. in that 1 month. I think it'd be best for you to get a new drop, but if it's only personal amounts you should be fine ordering to the same place again. GL with your next order  ;D.

    ya, biggest mistake was it being my first time with the process and just going through such info via a friend's opinion rather than actually researching it myself... something i usually wouldn't do but i THOUGHT they knew what they were talking about... (lesson learned!!) I do have a new drop but my main concern is if the vendor will be understanding enough to cater to my mistake or if i should just accept my losses and re-order :/

    If you're lucky then the vendor might be a really nice guy and maybe reship or give you a small 25% refund or something.

    Hey man, welcome to the forums. Sorry to hear about your first order. As many have said, using a fake name "Errl Kushman" for example, is not sugggested practice for shipping. Not only does it look goofy but, you lose some of your "plausable deniability" fallback when ordering to a fake name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its okay though, we all make mistakes at some point. Hope you can minimize them and make this the biggest one :-). Really though, as a buyer, if your pad is clean (e,g, you're not keeping kidnapped women locked in your basement), its "safe" to order. Instead of your real name. I would suggest you mis-spell your name slightly as well. Instead of "john q. public" send it to "Jon Q Public". Use your imagination.

    I want to ask if you are in the US I am from Canada and an alias wont stop a package unless there is a hicup with shipping then they would want to verify your identity....assuming it is a small order.   You say you tried to contact the vendor and got no response This would raise a flag.... I assume you FE'ed for this transaction. more details might let people help you more but be very selective just how much details you provide on an open forum...   BUT more than likely it is not a lose but an expensive way to learn...its only a lose if you didnt learn from it.

    hahaha, i like your style  :D  an expensive "loss" perhaps but not a loss at all!!! and yes, i am in the US, and im not worried about the vendor, from what ive seen from him in his # of sales, feedback, and trackin his convos in the forum and all ive seen coming out of him is reassuring. thanks again everyone for the tips, guidance, and good vibes altogether &lt;3
