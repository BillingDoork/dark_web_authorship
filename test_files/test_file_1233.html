    Okay, so, about a week ago I ordered .5 of coke from a good vendor. He's been around for only two months but the feedback on his page is pretty solid. Well, I ordered it around the first of June and it says it was shipped on the 2nd. But he tells me that it was going out on the 3rd. Well, now its friday the 7th and it's not here. I don't know if I should just message my vendor today for some info or just stick it out and see if it comes tomorrow. What is the missus to do? :-\

    did he actually message you saying it had been sent or that he just marked on your order 'in transit
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some vendors mark in transit once they have received the order on their end, and then prepare your order and ship it then :)

    What type of postage? If it was express, then yes send a message asking for tracking or some help.  If priority, wait through mail tomorrow and then if nothing send a message for help.  If regular mail, well your fucked. :o  JK  But nothing you can do with the latter.  :)

    It was marked in transit on sunday and I believe that same night he told me he was shipping it out the next day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not exactly sure on the postage, on his vendor page it says that all orders should arrive within 3-5 business days of being shipped.

    Well, you SHOULD know the postage. So shame on you right there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You really can't find out? Have you tried going to the listing and clicking on postage?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even better, you can "add to cart" the item, and "select postage",  then "Update Cart" and see tell us what it says there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To get the item back out of your cart, go to quantity, and delete the 1. Then click "Update Cart"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This comes in handy when you want to estimate your order, and you want to see if you have enough BTC's
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise, it's pretty hard to help you at this point, except to stick with the majority here, wait it out. Till Monday. If it's regular mail (1st class) it could take a week. Not normally, but it can.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If Priority, they say 2-3 days, but there's no guarantee. So that could easily push it out to Monday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As another indicator of possible trouble. What's the latest feedback say? Any others saying "Mail could've been faster" etc?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wish I could help more, but without the postage details, it's kind of "up in the air" at this point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When and if it comes, please tell us here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise, Good Luck!

    Well, there was only one postage option (0.03 btc) when it came to shipping options for what I bought, so there's that...
    <br/>
    The feedback was full of fast shipping, so maybe I'm just going crazy considering its my first order.

    There's nothing I can do except wait it out, and it pains me to accept it but its the truth.

    Yeah, that's the hardest part, as Tom Petty said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We all know what it's like, especially with the weekend approaching.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Having over 100 orders completed, I've learned to say at this point, "Ah it's probably not coming till Monday"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then be pleasantly surprised if it shows on Saturday. I always feel that they don't try as hard on Saturday. ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hmm... .03 BTC? last Sunday? What was it like $121 - $122 USD? - So about $4 s+h? - Probably 1st class. It will come ;)

    Last month I ordered from a reputable vendor who also gets rave reviews concerning his shipping speed. I paid for Priority which is supposed to take 2-3 days to arrive. Maybe 3-5 if things are a bit slow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My shit didn't arrive for three and a half WEEKS. Other people on here have also had issues with the USPS being slow as shit too.

    That's totally fucked up! Though you're right, a lot of people have been saying that. This is not counting the vendors that don't put it in the mail for 2 or 3 days.  &gt;:( A PET PEEVE OF MINE &gt;:(  - Especially on Priority. If it's not in the mail withing 24hrs, shipping should be free. IMHO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Though there have been a lot of orders that were put in the mail within a reasonable time frame, and damn it, if it didn't take a week or more! That's priority???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think not. - Then there's conspiracy threorists who claim that vendors printing their own postage with a machine, may print it on that day, but drop it in the mail at a later date, and there's no other 'postmark' per se. No 'cancellation' date on the stamp portion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Who knows, I just hope that was a passing phase. - I had a few that took 4-5 days, but that was Memorial Day, still though I ordered on Wed prior, and didn't get till the Wed after. - Something wrong there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's hope "TheMissus" gets hers today! 8)

    Sometimes the post can be slow. It depends on where you are and where he/she is too. Always give it a week before sending a message (unless express - give 3 days if express).
