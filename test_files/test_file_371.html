    My first two orders are in transit now (excited, yay), and I had some shit I had to buy from amazon and other places.  I was wondering if ordering them at the same time would be good so that it wasn't the only package arriving in roughly the same time frame, or if it might draw more attention... any thoughts/input?  I'm in the US so its our wonderful USPS we're talking.

    Thanks guys.  8)

    Why exactly would it matter? There's nothing odd about getting packages in the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm constantly shopping online and getting shit from all over the world nearly every day. Its cheaper and you don't pay tax.

    It's only sketch if YOU make it sketch.

    Exactly. It doesn't matter either way. If the do detect the drugs then they catch the drugs at the sorting office next to the airport, so those people won't know you're getting lots of packages or not anyway.

    I do this all the time, it almost makes me believe that it confuses the postman. Currently I have one illegal package and two legal ones on the way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It also would let me know if my address is flagged for inspection or some shit if my legal package doesn't show up in a timely manner.

    Addresses don't get flagged, someone proved it already on the forums. I honestly don't think it matters whether you order legal stuff or not, you could order strictly illegal things and no one would be the wiser so long as you don't get caught. The mailman doesn't know whether he's delivering drugs or your new hello kitty wallet, it's just another package to him and he sees hundreds if not thousands everyday.

    lol that's true. Speaking of legal/illegal packagaes, I got your package and harry potter merchandise! my poor postman, he knows that I'm a potter fanatic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and it might also help that I don't generally run around my house screaming "OMG I GOT MY DRUGS!!!!!" right after the post comes by.

    Iunno, working at a courier company we handle over 6k peices of freight a day and we're not even that big of a depo, and no one cares what the package is or who it's going to or how much your getting, we're just doing our job and have no current proto-calls for giving a rats ass about anything that isn't a dangerous good.. The last time i saw a cop (which wasn't very often to begin with) he was already looking for a particular package without the help of a dog.
