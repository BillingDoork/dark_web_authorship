    Hi SR users!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since 3-4 weeks I made the experience, that post-pieces need double time (and more) to reach their destination.
    <br/>
    Before that, it used to need about 3-5 days inside EU (mostly 3days) to reach the goal. Now I got a letter from NL that arrived after 15 days!! to middle EU!? Also every single piece came through until this change - now I miss already 3 orders!
    <br/>
    I fear, that the posties and/or customs got now more aware of these pages (SR, BMR,...) and will search more intensive to catch some of these items. (1 week ago report on euronews,... about SR)
    <br/>
    I think, now they collect a big amount of post-pieces in distributor-centers (Verteilerzentrum etc.), so that maybe some smell get through, and then the dog will do his work.
    <br/>
    Maybe "they" found several pieces and were surprised, how much is coming on the postal way?
    <br/>
    And so they will intense their work to find as much as they can!
    <br/>
    I read a thread of a swedish guy who made the same experience in sweden (since easter)!
    <br/>
    I feel very uncomfortable to order again until this delay is cleared.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did anybody made similar experience?
    <br/>
    Everybody who feels same should answer to this thread, so maybe we find out a system behind...   I still hope it´s just a paranoia, but the delay (and 3 missing orders) is a fact!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks to all!!

    Hello, I also think this, orders from EU used to take maximum 3 days to get to me, be from SR or any other place, now they're taking like 5-6 days. But they don't smell it inside the EU man, just in customs. In my country for example I think it is because of the austerity, I know a few mail men personally and they're saying they're cutting on lots of things, they're even going to put some of them in bicycles instead of mopeds and shit.

    From a Vendor perspective we can agree..since about 3 weeks we have "a few" more letters missing inside EU and most are taking longer, but arrive eventually...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The above stated reasons are valid also summer is getting very hot now and Germany and a few other counties had record flooding...

    We counter with using more frequent new layouts and keeping tabs on internal statistics...
