    Since we have some orders in transit ourselves, we would like to build a little overview about how long postage/packages take to ship from one location to another.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So any buyers/vendors with some information on this subject (based on own experiences) can leave a reply and we'll try to populate/update the list of information.

    I started keeping a calendar for that very reason.  I was concerned about the "2 day priority" packages taking so long, but I understand that is how it goes.  Here are my last 5 orders:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4 of them were priority "2day"  from Southern Cali to the southeast (TN):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2 of them took 3 days, not counting the day it was mailed.  For instance mailed on Monday morning and showed up Thursday.  2 was 4 days, not counting the day it was mailed.  For example, mailed Monday morning, arrived Friday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, not counting the day they were shipped, 3.5 days was the four order average from So Cal to TN.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My last order was a letter from N Cali to TN, which was mailed first class.  It took three days, not counting the mail date.  Hope that helps.

    In my experience..and a lot of it is just ebay and amazon and the like.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically priority is arriving 2nd day after mailing so long as you and sender are within 100 miles of an airport. And First class arrives 3rd day..the big thing is that living within 100 miles of an airport.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is a new map on USPS that shows you which areas are 2 day priority arrival, its a thread here somewhere that is probably a page or so back.

    my experience: NL to UK
    <br/>
    Normally takes 2 business days, including the day of putting into transit (e. put into transit monday, got it delivered wednesday morning). Sometimes takes 3.
    <br/>
    Have experience with 2 NL vendors, both use priority stamps on their packages/ letters.

    This exactly! Though I add a day for SR packages, because in my 3 orders with 2 vendors both marked in transit the day before it actually shipped.

    Yep, it is common to see a package is dropped in a blue box on say Monday but may not hit the system and be on its way til Tuesday..which if its priority and you are not in one of the 3 day zones(those more then 100 miles from an airport of some size) you will have it Thursday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The people who end up getting express (overnight) 2 days after shipping are in those areas as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is the map(clearnet) where you can see how long it takes for priority to get from zip code to zip code.

    Wow... I just went on the USPS website and noticed that First Class mail supposedly takes 3 days on average. Bullshit. It's been 8 days since marked in transit, 9 days since my order and still my First Class order hasn't shown up. It also says on the website that First Class and Priority mail usually should arrive about the same time during normal times of the year (i.e. not holidays/busy times).

    I am in a rural area, that could have something to do with it...

    Also **protip** I just noticed, some vendors actually require this anyway: make sure you include the last four digits of your zip code. The USPS website says it helps to expedite your mail. I started doing it all the time because my first vendor required it, seems to be good practice although it certainly didn't help that first order get here faster.
