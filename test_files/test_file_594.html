    Another safe delivery, more thanks to careful vendors and whatever gods I am rightfully sacrificing brain cells to. But today as I leave more 5/5 feedback and words of praise, it occurs to me: we never, ever speak of the particulars of stealth here or on SR proper, yet how easy would it be for LE to find out exactly what a vendor's methods are? Want to know how vendor X is shipping product Y? Place an order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm past thinking I'm giving ideas to LE - they're not stupid (by and large). So maybe I'm missing something. What's to prevent them from learning the latest and greatest shipping methods of our best vendors this way? Should we be keeping feedback to a simple numerical score and none of this high praise? Seems like the worst favour I could do for a vendor (and their customers, including me) is bust out with OH SNAP NO ONE WOULD EVER THINK OF THIS kind of stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I wrong?

    Hmmm, dunno?  I think fundamentally the less that is posted 'publicly' then quite simply, the harder LE will have to work to profile Vendors and Buyers.  Will it mean they get less info if we post less?... or will they jsut get the same info via different means?  IMO they will likely find out what they are motivated (or resourced) to find out wither way... so why the fuck hand it to em on a plate?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I totally understand your point oldtoby, but:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.  I personally think there is plenty of info on these forums if you are a buyer wanting to do some research:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2.  If you want to give a Vendor some super kudos for great service, packaging etc, then PM the dude... it doesn't have to be in a public forum to carry weight.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know this is all very subjective and we all have our own opinions, but really, why would the mantra of "less is more"' be anything less than TOTALLY relevant for this marketplace??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my two cents guys,but  I reckon 'stealth' is best kept very fucking 'stealth'!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have a good weekend, cheers!

    Why post that type of info and let LE be lazy. If they want that type of info they should have to go through the trouble of getting bitcoins and using some of there resources to find out how we send packs through mail. The more of there time we can take up by doing these little things the more safer we really are.

    Knowingly transacting in a drug deal is a criminal offence. If any vendor was to be taken down by this sort of technique then it would be most likely thrown out of court.

    Still shouldn't really be mentioned in detail, I mean at least in the case of them ordering off a vendor, the vendor gets money from LE lol. And they probably aim for the bigger fish vendors than the small fry which would probably make it harder for some of them at least to get funding for purchases if it's not even worth their time. So it definately makes it easier for them just posting it... but meh, each to their own, should respect the vendors wishes though if they specifically request that stealth not be mentioned.

    I can completely understand how what I said might be taken as "So let's go ahead and post about the details of stealth, why not?" but that's absolutely not what I intended. Rather, that was my way of emphasizing: "Hey, look, see this thing we're all obviously concerned about (enough to have a forum rule about it)? Yeah, it's easily defeated and we never even really acknowledge that." I don't know where that takes us, but there it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As to how to behave publicly about these things, I'm a little torn, because on the one hand, I rely on my fellow posters to tell me whose stealth is excellent and whose is dangerous and should be stayed well away from. In return, I think I should probably provide that level of feedback. But as a matter of personal discretion, having now considered this, I think I will simply acknowledge good stealth and do all the "OMG SO CREATIVE" to PMs with vendors, because I don't want to draw LE attention to them (obviously, since I love them) and, it seems to me, such methods of stealth are easily investigated. To the comment above about that being illegal/prohibited, I don't think so. Drug buys are age old; it's the ne plus ultra of stings.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The analogy that has just leapt to mind, actually, is that of a certain bitcoin vendor, who is my personal saviour as far as these things are concerned, and every time I see them talked up on SR I simultanously nod (yeah! they deserve recognition!) and cringe (no! may as well paint a target on them!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, thanks for the feedback. These things are always better talked out than rattling around in the old noggin endlessly. Cheers.

    Nicely summarised oldtoby, and good to see a topic result in some clarity for the OP in a short time with minimal postings.  I think your decision to PM the 'super kudos' to your favorite Vendor/s is a great decision!

    Yes... maybe... probably.  But how long do you think they would 'stay in business' for unless they were actually getting orders through to buyers successfully?  I am not sure that a legitimate sting operation would involve LE distributing relatively small quantities (ie personal use rule) of decent quality, class A drugs to large number everyday citizens?  I don't think they would achieve much buy catching a bunch of small time, retail shoppers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, I think I will stick with Vendors who have minimum 6 months of successful dealings on the Road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Interesting question that you pose though and does warrant some thinking through, cheers.

    If LE is going to find out about shipping methods anyway, we might as well make it cost them and allow some drug dealers to make money.

    I would totally be up for contributing my remaining bitcoins from each transaction into a slush fund dedicated to sending out the sketchiest packages possible with nothing in them just to fuck with the agents.
    <br/>
    Imagine, a perfect, pristine package that looks totally innocent. And is in fact devoid of narcotics, having been smeared with smelly drugs all over the outside to get those doges excited. Perhaps even suspicious looking shapes can
    <br/>
    be included for those bored x-ray technicians. It would have to be quite demoralizing to deal with that everyday. Employing all methods available and coming up with nothing but a stinky empty package to nowhere.

     Are you serious? Kops do 'controlled buys' every fucking day. Also, Kops do not always operate within the law.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just my own opinion, but I believe a shitload of LE from Australia have come onto the road over the last year posing as first time buyers, and simply not paying/causing grief.
     <br/>
     It got so bad that many vendors simply refused to ship to Aus. Not only that, but other unscrupulous vendors caught onto this and started demanding FE and select scamming. Both vendors AND
     <br/>
     customers got screwed. The shitstorm worked perfectly for those cunts, also because they gained an invaluable insight into shipping methods and developing counter-stealth, for lack of a better term.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This uncertainty, I believe, is their only current option. They cannot crack TOR, they cannot trace Bitcoins(if you're smart). They have no fucking clue WHO sent the seized package. Neither
     <br/>
     does the innocent and clueless recipient who was never even in possession of it. They know this. Even if they seize a large amount and charge someone there's no-one further up the chain to take down.
     <br/>
     They can never go after the 'big' cases like with 'street' cases. Half the reason the drug war is fought today is for big cases and big payoffs for local authorities who seize the wealth.
     <br/>
     Stick to small amounts, nothing stupid. You will not go to jail.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     PS for all you Aussies on here. Who remembers Ryan West from the 7:30 report? You know that dickhead that went on TV and broke the first rule of Silk Road? The one who 'wanted' to get caught? I know from people close
     <br/>
     to me that he was not caught due to a seized package, he was caught because the neighbors got sick of people coming round to his parents house at all hours to buy drugs. They put him in it. He did have seized packages, but nothing happened or could happen until the Kops were called by his goddam neighbors. Furthermore that guy was selling shitloads of pills, you don't stay out of jail without singing like a bitch, if not your supplier, than your best customers. Kops have a quota after all...

    Even though I agree with most of what is written in the post above there is something I should add, seized packages, even small ones can result in follow up by LE, I would strongly advise anyone reading this to not get complacent regarding their drop arrangements and make the mistake of just assuming nothing will happen because you haven't read about it on here. If you have the ability to sever all ties to your drop then do it! using your home or people you knows address for o/s orders is not advisable.

    I agree, this is a good practice.  In addition, anything you think that could be improved on could be mentioned as well.  Obviously the vendor will do as they will but I've gotten some envelopes where the baggies could be easily felt through the envelope.  I won't use that vendor again, one bad delivery can screw your delivery address.

    This is a good topic. IMO the competent LE learn the rules of stealth the same way new vendors do, by reading, researching, and yes, maybe even making a few purchases. It's really much too late in the game to hide the info, and as an old school (stone age 20th century) dealer, I can tell you that the rules of stealth haven't changed much. The only things that have really changed are the materials involved. Any old timers on here remember wrapping weed in saran wrap and vaseline before mailing???? Those were the fucking days, lol

    Keep a low profile and a don't make noise. Drawing attention, even more than already exists, by rubbing your nuts in the facts of LE and saying "HEY GUYZ WE'RE SHIPPIN' DRUGS IN THE MAIL LOL" just raises attention to the exact place you don't want it.

    Yep agreed... and I do hope most Vendors understand the high value of a 'safe' mailing address for a buyer.  Personally, I really only have one address that I can use without implicating anyone else if a delivery goes wrong.  Therefore, by my own standards, once I have had two no-shows to this address i'm done!  That will be it for me.  I will  no longer be able to use SR.  So if a Vendor gets sloppy, there is very little chance he will get any heat... it will be the address the goods are going to that will get the heat.  So c'mon Vendors, take your stealth up a notch and help keep us all in the game!

     to me that he was not caught due to a seized package, he was caught because the neighbors got sick of people coming round to his parents house at all hours to buy drugs. They put him in it.

    LE knows everything there is to know because WE know it, how did we find out? The same way they have. Rubbing our nuts in their face can only INCREASE our chances of success at this point; All their manpower wasted without a political reason to increase it! Until the wrong kid ultimately drops dead...

    LE does not want any more exposure to this embarrassment anytime soon. No-one's gonna know we're rubbing our nuts in their face. Only them, and us. And...basically, we already are  ;D let's give em the salad it's need tossing, right?

    There is nothing new under the sun and we are kidding ourselves to think that not mentioning stealth is in fact, beating the system.
    <br/>
    If it makes you or your customers feel better then make the effort and use stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sending it internationally with stealth is kinda dumb imo. I speak only for my country but I am sure others will agree.
    <br/>
    You are just lucky. You are lucky it didnt get pulled for a random search....there goes you stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And then there is the drug using/dealing members of customs officials and postal workers.
    <br/>
    Last time I checked robots are not delivering or handling your mail.
    <br/>
    Somewhere down the line from the vendor to your box, it gets man handled.
    <br/>
    Wow somebody sent this guy a cap/hat all the way from the UK.... mine
    <br/>
    Tshirt....mine
    <br/>
    Book...mine
    <br/>
    Vitamins....lol....mine
    <br/>
    DVD... lol...mine
    <br/>
    The list goes on.
    <br/>
    Stupid stuff I can buy at home or download and vendors and others shipping contraband call this stealth...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What about the packaging? domestic... not a problem. OS mail with drugs in it are showing signs of blatant patterns.
    <br/>
    Signs that can easily be picked up by postal workers.
    <br/>
    I am extremely tempted to start profiling OS SR mail sent to friends and myself.
    <br/>
    Is this uncool and should I just forget about it??
    <br/>
    Not to expose anyone...just want to make a point that most are not getting.

    Making OTHER people's mail read false positive could work well too - take old, shitty weed, grind it up, and dump it into a mail-receiving box. Every legit package that passes through that will get a dog's attention. Make it so 99% of packages that get flagged are even good business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ways this could backfire: Weedy smelling mail could cause a reaction from the public, or LE could spin it into "This has become a huge problem, we need more money and resources" - this is why I tend to agree with the "lay low and don't draw attention" techniques. Engaging in active disruption techniques could have more of a "kick bees nest WHILE stealing their honey" effect, instead of just quietly getting away with as much honey as possible. If my metaphor holds.

     There is nothing new under the sun and we are kidding ourselves to think that not mentioning stealth is in fact, beating the system.
     <br/>
     If it makes you or your customers feel better then make the effort and use stealth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sending it internationally with stealth is kinda dumb imo. I speak only for my country but I am sure others will agree.
     <br/>
     You are just lucky. You are lucky it didnt get pulled for a random search....there goes you stealth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And then there is the drug using/dealing members of customs officials and postal workers.
     <br/>
     Last time I checked robots are not delivering or handling your mail.
     <br/>
     Somewhere down the line from the vendor to your box, it gets man handled.
     <br/>
     Wow somebody sent this guy a cap/hat all the way from the UK.... mine

     Book...mine
     <br/>
     Vitamins....lol....mine
     <br/>
     DVD... lol...mine
     <br/>
     The list goes on.
     <br/>
     Stupid stuff I can buy at home or download and vendors and others shipping contraband call this stealth...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What about the packaging? domestic... not a problem. OS mail with drugs in it are showing signs of blatant patterns.
     <br/>
     Signs that can easily be picked up by postal workers.
     <br/>
     I am extremely tempted to start profiling OS SR mail sent to friends and myself.
     <br/>
     Is this uncool and should I just forget about it??

     Not to expose anyone...just want to make a point that most are not getting.

    Your idea of stealth is obviously different to mine going by that list of items :)
    <br/>
    Hiding something in a dvd case isn't stealth, it's stupid :)
    <br/>
    If it was all down to luck then my packages must be truly blessed because I've never lost a stealth package to customs yet, I've had them open my packages and send them on :)
    <br/>
    Stealth works, it's not just bad luck that some vendors lose more packages than others, it's because some vendors think a vac seal is the ultimate in stealth :)

    The two biggest obstacles to LE success in discovering and interdicting drug shipments from SR vendors are postal regulations and technology limitations.  They know this, and until they can do a damned thing on either front, we keep winning.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, success is fleeting and all good things must come to an end.  These maxims are timeless.  Smoke 'em while you got 'em.

      Are you serious? Kops do 'controlled buys' every fucking day. Also, Kops do not always operate within the law.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Just my own opinion, but I believe a shitload of LE from Australia have come onto the road over the last year posing as first time buyers, and simply not paying/causing grief.
      <br/>
      It got so bad that many vendors simply refused to ship to Aus. Not only that, but other unscrupulous vendors caught onto this and started demanding FE and select scamming. Both vendors AND
      <br/>
      customers got screwed. The shitstorm worked perfectly for those cunts, also because they gained an invaluable insight into shipping methods and developing counter-stealth, for lack of a better term.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This uncertainty, I believe, is their only current option. They cannot crack TOR, they cannot trace Bitcoins(if you're smart). They have no fucking clue WHO sent the seized package. Neither
      <br/>
      does the innocent and clueless recipient who was never even in possession of it. They know this. Even if they seize a large amount and charge someone there's no-one further up the chain to take down.
      <br/>
      They can never go after the 'big' cases like with 'street' cases. Half the reason the drug war is fought today is for big cases and big payoffs for local authorities who seize the wealth.
      <br/>
      Stick to small amounts, nothing stupid. You will not go to jail.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      PS for all you Aussies on here. Who remembers Ryan West from the 7:30 report? You know that dickhead that went on TV and broke the first rule of Silk Road? The one who 'wanted' to get caught? I know from people close
      <br/>
      to me that he was not caught due to a seized package, he was caught because the neighbors got sick of people coming round to his parents house at all hours to buy drugs. They put him in it. He did have seized packages, but nothing happened or could happen until the Kops were called by his goddam neighbors. Furthermore that guy was selling shitloads of pills, you don't stay out of jail without singing like a bitch, if not your supplier, than your best customers. Kops have a quota after all...

     Even though I agree with most of what is written in the post above there is something I should add, seized packages, even small ones can result in follow up by LE, I would strongly advise anyone reading this to not get complacent regarding their drop arrangements and make the mistake of just assuming nothing will happen because you haven't read about it on here. If you have the ability to sever all ties to your drop then do it! using your home or people you knows address for o/s orders is not advisable.

    What he said. whether right or wrong , during war (drug war...) you maintain radio silence. encrypted or not (remember what happened with the Enigma....? ) you shut the fuck up or resort to private communication channels if desperate. The pigs are not dumb, I agree. But they are not resourced to fight each and every of our factions at every turn . Just like business, they have to hit numbers and unless you are the DEA, you cannot hustle on SR all day to profile vendors and their methods as you don't have the budget for it. Money talks folks. In any industry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know that most big vendors arent shit at stealth because they cant do it as well as COUGH some AWESOME NL vendors... but because they dont have the time and still get 98% of the shit through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is like buying stock in a company on SR (ok...so I am on the share theme today... fuck off).. you commit what you can afford to lose. Not only the vendor in this case...but the customer alike. Expect them to be gambling with your product's stealth like you are gambling to buy an illicit substance and have it mailed across the world at a fraction of local market prices free of gang affiliates...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advice: learn from your own mistakes and shut the fuck up. this forum should be abut drug quality and shit talking....mainly shit talking.

    I'm having trouble parsing this. Are you saying bigger/mainstream vendors may know their stuff but have so many customers they can take risks with your package's stealth cause they have buyers to burn? If so, I follow the logic, but it hasn't been my experience so far - the more mainstream I've gone, the better. To the point where now I'd actually consider international from some major vendors less risky than domestic from others.

    I'd agree that some OS orders to Aus have absolutely blown my mind considering the 'infrastructure' required to achieve such stealth. I picture in my mind teams of people coming together brainstorming, experimenting, prototyping and ultimately delivering.
    <br/>
    Still amazes me ANY time something rocks up tho. It's like christmas for adults, every fucking week  ;D
    <br/>
    Customs must be scratching their heads wondering why anyone would go to such great lengths for such little shipments. And they haven't even found the good ones yet  :P

    Are you in the US? Have you received any international shipments to judge the difference? This is intriguing to me, mostly for the price of international. One big shipment that will last me years seems safer than ordering domestically every 4 or 6 months.
