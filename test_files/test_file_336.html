    Last Saturday I placed an order first class usps it says it was shipped out sunday but i know they only process on Sundays but do not ship domestically.  I know the vendor is legit because he constantly getting rave reviews everyday on how great his boy is.  It's been five days for me and still nothing via first class. :(   Packages from across the country first class takes 3-4 days...it always puzzled me how neighboring states sometimes takes even longer. hrmmm Any help is appreciated

    how do you expect us to help you with so little info? My advice, I guess, would be to pop a valium. See if it arrives tomorrow or even Monday. If not, contact the vendor for advice

    First just relax. Did he give you a DCN? Keep tracking and if it doesn't come go to the post office and ask where it is and whats going on with it, i have had this happen with a lot of my customers. One thing i notice is a lot of buyers assume everyone in the world knows they have an illegal package, I look them in the face sending and receiving the most dangerous things, these people at the post office have no idea or care.
