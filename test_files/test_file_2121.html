    Hey all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the past, my best friend and I have ordered bongs off of online headshops (mainly bongoutlet.ca), used his name and my address and the package was received. I just wanted to make sure that if I use either his name, or a fake one that my SR package would get delivered.
    <br/>

    Sorry if this has been covered before, I didn't know what to search for on the forums. &lt;_&gt;

    Depends on your postman. They are not required by law to deliver a package with a name that does not match the address. However I've even had packages delivered with no name and only an address. Go figure.

    Hi bekthatsu,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The idea is to make your orders from here blend in with regular mail. Why would you intentionally make them stick out? Using your friend's name and your address affords you no protection, nor does using a fake name - I can't understand how you could possibly think that it makes it safer in some way?  ???
    <br/>
    Use your real name and real address and you'll have no problems with receiving your product.

    I thought the if I used my friend's (or a fake) name and my address, that it would be a lot harder (or impossible) to put me in a bad situation with the law. Am I completely wrong in this assumption?

    This seems to be a common misconception. You're aiming for plausible deniability. Now it's possible, of course, that your friend decided he wanted to receive his mail at your house. Great. Except for one thing. This is the only piece of mail that's not being delivered to his own address. Wouldn't that strike you as odd if you were investigating narcotics in the mail?
    <br/>
    In the incredibly unlikely event that the cops decide to raid your residence over personal use quantities of drugs, you need to be able to say "I have no idea what that is, or why it's addressed to me, and I demand to speak to my lawyer before I answer any more of your questions."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I said in my earlier post, you want it to blend in with regular mail. It could appear odd to your mailman that a different name is residing at the address each time, and he may bring it up with his supervisor. On top of that, it makes no difference whose name is on the package in terms of you'll still be the one holding it at the end of the day. You want plausible deniability, so your explanation for why there's a package of drugs being sent to your house needs to be PLAUSIBLE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get from your postings that you're still in your teens, would I be correct in my assumption? You need to read the security forum thoroughly before you make any purchases on here. You need to understand everything you read, and if you don't understand it, you need to read it until you do. The chances of you being 'busted' for receiving personal amounts of drugs in the mail are slim to none - it will most likely just be seized and you may or may not get a letter informing you of this. Your address will also likely be flagged for future random inspections. However, there will be no 'trouble from the law' as long as you're not ordering large amounts, and as long as you retain PLAUSIBLE deniability.

    Okay, yeah. That makes sense. Thanks for your help graham.

    And to answer your question, yes, I'm 18. It doesn't help that I get overly paranoid over anything dealing with drugs.

    No problem at all, if I can be of any help in the future, don't hesitate to fire me a PM. Everyone gets paranoid to some degree when they're dealing with drugs - don't worry about it!  ;) I just guessed that you were around that age because it sounds like you're still living in your parent's house, which would make you even more paranoid should something happen as they'd then know about it.
    <br/>
    Keep your orders small and infrequent until you move out / secure an unrelated address (maybe a friend who has their own place who's cool with getting orders shipped to them for a freebie here and there), and you'll be just fine!  :)
