    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've read lots and lots regarding this on the forum but I am considering making an order for 28g of bud, the seller in question will ask for FE either way but will give you the option of recorded delivery or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My questions are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1: 28g seems like a lot of volume (I'm buying it once so I don't have to constantly buy and fuck around with BTC) so is this going to be able to fit through a letterbox, therefore no face to face interaction?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2: Everything I've read here says to never do recorded delivery/sign for package, but how risky is UK domestic and is there anything I can do to identify an controlled delivery?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3: I had one package not arrive, that was 25 days ago, I never considered my address to be "burned" (never even thought about it, you live you learn!) so I ordered more, from a new seller (the one I'm considering ordering from now) and product arrived next day, is it safe to assume that my address is still safe/not burned/medium rare?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4: I'm interested in hearing anything anyone might have to say on UK domestic orders of cannabis at this weight, any tips/tricks/whatever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many thanks in advance.

    You're not going to get a controlled delivery for just an ounce here. This isn't the states.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As this is UK to UK, there's no customs involved so unless the vendor is stupid with packaging, bar a dodgy postie, it's pretty much bound to come. Recorded or not.

    Recorded is no different than first class, other than requiring a signature. So it won't matter as long as the seller's stealth is good.

    not sure about the UK but in USA domestic mail is extremely safe. The domestic postal inspectors seize a few thousand packages a year and most of them are multi-kilo packages of marijuana, meth, coke or heroin. If your vendor does a half decent job of packaging something domestic, the odds of the package being intercepted are probably something like 1:1000, although I did just pull that number out of my ass.

    Absolutely right. Domestic with proper vac + foil sealing and packaging is basically foolproof, for now anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    yo but Aang, ditch the FE. Too many people have been burned by that. Unless you have no buyer stats, in which case I guess you'll have to.

    Thanks for the input, I'm really interested to know if recorded delivery is stupid or not, it seems to me that's shipping is the weakest link in the system and if going by RD there's no real way to know if it's a controlled delivery.

    In the UK you'll get an HMRC letter if your package gets intercepted, or a controlled delivery, although the very worst that'll happen for an ounce of bud is that they'll ask you to come down to the police station for questioning. Any UK seller worth their salt should give you a full refund in the event of a seizure if you show them that letter.

    I've used recorded delivery options on a few occasions, mostly during Christmas time and when there are temp workers doing the rounds.  I've never had an issue but I don't use it often because generally there's no need to.  One time I wasn't in when the weed showed up and I had to go collect it from the local RM depot with ID, but it was fine they didn't know what was inside so I went and got it.  I don't think I would use special delivery for class A's though just in case but for weed I think it's fine if you want to ensure next day delivery or you don't trust a temp postie with it.

    The other way I look at it is this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Item sent first class:
    <br/>
    -If you get asked to sign for it it's a BIG red flag, since you shouldn't ever have to sign for first class.
    <br/>
    -If it doesn't arrive, then 99% of the time either the seller or the buyer is being dishonest - HMRC will send you a letter if it gets seized, although it may be weeks down the line.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Item sent recorded:
    <br/>
    -You'll never know if you're being asked to sign because of recorded or because you're busted.
    <br/>
    -Seller's location/time of posting is available for all the world to see, could make it much easier to track them down based on intercepted packages.

    MDUK: Thanks very much, this reflects my feelings on the situation, it seems by going recorded delivery you are essentially giving up your only sure-fire way to protect yourself and avoid being busted. As far as I know there's no way to tell if it's just an RD or a CD, as shipping is the weakest link in the chain of SR it seems to me to be pretty stupid to give that up,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like you say 99% of the time it would be the seller/buyer being dishonest. I can't see posties nicking stuff, in my whole life I've never had a parcel not arrive because a postie stole it. I'm sure it does happen sometimes, but it must be an infinitesimally small percentage of deliveries. And if RoyalM didn't pick up that it was contraband before giving it to the postie, I don't see how a postie would figure it out, especially if the stealth is good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Rowsdowner: Can't you just ask them to redeliver? Almost every time I've not been around to open the door I just pop on the RM website and schedule it to be redelivered the following day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well unless anyone has anything to add it seem RD is not worth it, thanks very much for the advice.

    You seem to have already addressed your own concerns. Buy from a decent seller and you have very little to worry about. Even if by some miracle the package is opened and reported in transit, if you have a shred of common sense (mouth shut/clean house prior to delivery), it'll be fine.

    Flakesmith: Fair enough, thanks man. The thing is as I'm new to this whole game my paranoia level is high, which is exactly why I came to the forums to get some advice, I have no knowledge of CD's in the UK, whether RD is risky or not so I'm relying on the community for advice and to help me align my paranoia meter. It would have been really helpful for me if you had said something along the lines of:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Paranoia is good man, but you're going a little overboard here; RD is fine for an ounce of pot, if it was caught you'd get an HMRC letter and that would be about as far as it would be likely to go, CD is unlikely as in the UK LE aren't as hot on weed as they might be in the US, my recommendation is to clear your house of anything incriminating for a few days and go RD. When it arrives don't open it right away and write "Return to sender" on the box. If anything goes wrong just keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know for some long time SR users it's probably hard to remember the perspective of a newbie but that's the kind of advice that is golden.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does my fantasy answer essentially sum up your feelings on the matter Flakesmith? And thanks again for taking the time to help out a scaredy-cat.

    Special delivery is the most secure way to go in the UK,they are more determined to get it delivered next day by designated time than searching.Also,if you ask for a money special delivery or a special delivery pouch they will give you a seal poly post bag to put over your item if you are extra paranoid about revealing the contents/smell:D
    <br/>
    Back in the day of my sniffing everything I could I used to use SD for BIG amount of stuff!!:D

    That's not 100% true.

    Drugs dogs (although not many) are sometimes employed at sorting depots and packages that need to be flown across the country (such as SD items) get x-rayed.

    We have great turn around rates with domestic post, and to believe all, if any, SD items get xrayed would be foolish. Royal Mail has to return the full £6+ if the item isn't delivered the next day. Only in Mount Pleasant, uk's biggest sorting office is there X-ray machines, where large packages internationally get screened. No mail centres in Scotland have X-ray.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Domestic post has always been safe IMO, and it is on VERY rare occasions sniffer dogs operate in mail sorting centres, only when there's a case, never at random. Mainly because its a waste of police time for a few small parcels. But there was a link I read before kilos of coke and heroin were making it from London/Liverpool into Scotland using Royal Mail AND SD, and you think ounces of weed are problem?

    Although links 10 year old I believe all this to be exact same to date, due to fact I've had 2 mates work for RM...

     We have great turn around rates with domestic post, and to believe all, if any, SD items get xrayed would be foolish. Royal Mail has to return the full £6+ if the item isn't delivered the next day. Only in Mount Pleasant, uk's biggest sorting office is there X-ray machines, where large packages internationally get screened. No mail centres in Scotland have X-ray.

     Domestic post has always been safe IMO, and it is on VERY rare occasions sniffer dogs operate in mail sorting centres, only when there's a case, never at random. Mainly because its a waste of police time for a few small parcels. But there was a link I read before kilos of coke and heroin were making it from London/Liverpool into Scotland using Royal Mail AND SD, and you think ounces of weed are problem?

    I never said it was high risk.
    <br/>
    What I objected to was when you said "Uk&gt;uk mail doesn't get screened" and "there's literally no risk".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd rather we avoided complacency - yes it's not difficult to send drugs in the mail within the UK, but it's not 100% risk-free, so packaging standards even domestically need to reflect that.

    I'll rephrase it to avoid complacency then.

    <br/>
    There's a small risk sending UK&gt;UK but I wouldn't worry too much should the vendors packaging be inconspicuous and safe.
