    Brief rundown...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bought VitaCat's 250ug tabs in a sample size of two tabs.
    <br/>
    I live in the US.
    <br/>
    It's been thirteen days.
    <br/>
    I haven't finalized.
    <br/>
    VitaCat has not responded to my messages (I sent my first three days ago).
    <br/>
    What should I do?

    Given that it sounds like you didn't spend very much money (sample size of 2 pills), I would leave negative feedback but still finalize before it auto-finalizes.  That is sort of the whole point of buying samples; to ensure the vendor actually delivers, the product is legit,  and the transaction is smooth.

    Disregard the above.  I checked out his vendor page and he is out of town until June 23rd.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Given his reputation, I'm guessing he will make it right.  Plus, I too have a package (shipped domestically) that is on day 11.  I'm still hopeful it will arrive - I know it was shipped.

    Monkeybahop, since you haven't finalized the order yet,  click Resolve and submit a proposed resolution in the Resolution Center, which you think is fair (you have the choice of extending the due date out past the 17 days in case of a delay in the mail or you can request a full or partial refund). If you and the vendor can't agree on a solution, SR admin will step in and make a decision for you which is fair and just for both parties. :)
