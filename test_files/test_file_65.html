    Hi all..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a good stand with S/R having over 15 transactions and only 1 refund. My problem transcends from a hurricane that hit the east coast really badly (hurricane Sandy). Since then, I havent had internet or power.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a package auto F/E on me during that time. I have yet to receive the package (I don't know if that's because of the hurricane or package seizure.) It has been about 3 week since the shipment (from the Netherlands)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do I do and who do I bring this up to? I tried to contact the vendor but I have had access to SR for a total of 1 day before it went down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help would be very appreciated!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks
    <br/>

    You are out of luck
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its going to be up to the vendor and what he decides to do, he already has your money. SR isn't going to help you

    bart called it,
    <br/>
    i mean if it was due to SR being down you may have a shot with admins but since it was your net and power. Your in the vendors hands now and he is going to tell you on international shipments wait 30days before. anything. I mean he or she already got paid. So hope its a reputable and decent vendor. Also, i take it no tracking? is there a DCN? i mean if you can get that or proof you did not get it and he does not do whatever refund policy on page you can call him out on thread. but your best bet is to try and remain calm hope it shows. I mean you got to wait for SR to even be up and running before anything. Then you got to let him know nicely and respectfully the situation. Try and work it out and hope hes a honest vendor. IF not you are pretty much fucked. i mean ya 15 transactions but 1 post. so the only way if he dont do what he should is to bring it here and the community here is going to look at the vendor and im sure with much more than 1 post and your newbie status. So all i can say is wait for SR and try and work it out and
    <br/>
    Goodluck

    DPR said anyone who has issues due to auto finalize or whatever during this downtime they will do their best to fix.  once the site is up i'd try that.

    odd,
    <br/>
    i mean i am not sure but i think he said it was during sandy when people were without power so he didnt have internet which SR was up and running, because he said got power back and he wrote vendor about the Fe and then  SR went down
    <br/>
    i mean they can tell by dates. if i am wrong top dawg let me know but i think thats how i took it
