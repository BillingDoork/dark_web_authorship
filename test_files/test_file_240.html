    nl to us, 2 oz's of mdma, is this a bad idea? not trying to get arrested or lose my package, vendor im looking at has tons of positive feedback so he must have good stealth to be receiving them?
    <br/>
    im guessing if 2 oz's is seized it wont just be a customs letter? and should a real name be used or not? i always hear use real name to make sure it arrives but a fake name would be safer in this case.

    I woudn't order that much from the NL.  There are other good mdma vendors that ship from safer places.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would also expect more than just a seizure from such a large amount.

    I've just recently ordered from there, but a very small amount.
    <br/>
    The vendor has very good stealth packaging...as long as its all vacuum sealed x3, etc then the dogs wont get it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've used a fake name for overseas orders. Real name for domestic.

    Germany and the UK are much safer to order from than NL, but I think you're taking a big risk at least financially by ordering such a large amount from overseas to the US.  If it gets seized, which isn't that unlikely with an amount like that, you will definitely be looking at either a controlled delivery, raid or police visit to your home on top of losing money.  I would at least recommend ordering smaller amounts to test the vendors first.
