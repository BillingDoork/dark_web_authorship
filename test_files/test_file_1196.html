    For the TLDR:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the requirements towards obtaining a post office box, when using my own real information and drivers license (out of state)... If I change the date on some of my documents associated to the address on my license, how far will the post office go to verify it for one, and two, what implications arise from this type of change? The change would be simple, I would modify the month &amp; year on a couple of bills is all. The time is within 2 years, but thats obviously not within 60 days. I'm quick to say to myself "I'm not technically lying, I did live there, I'm just fudging the details a bit." Obviously though, that is in part stemming from my own desire to WANT this to work, which is why I came here. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't mind reading the details:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, the location that I am presently staying is not my home nor my home town, and not the address on my license, which is an out of state license. The address on the license was an address I did live at for an extended time (~1 1/2 years), and I have financial &amp; valid information pertaining to that, though its old (&gt;60 days).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The location that I am at is an owned property belonging to a family member, and I presently don't receive mail here. I've received a few pieces of junk mail, here or there at varoius times since it seems those places can always find you (which is kind of scary now that I think about it lol). The primary reason I don't want to receive mail here, is that while it is a family member, I do value my privacy and having the ability to filter my mail (legitimate or otherwise) is of value to me. I intend on forwarding/receiving my mail that originates from my past address(es) to where I am at now, so I will (eventually) receive all mail at the location.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The post office (I intend on using a real USPS office) will request two forms of ID - 1 photo and 1 non photo. I have multiple photo IDs, aside from my license. However, all of the addresses point to my old place. I've every intent to use my name and everything, since I intend on using this as a legitimate mailbox (in addition to SR). I understand all of the concerns, this isn't a decision I've made without researching here and elsewhere, but the one thing I couldn't find is the above information. I see all kinds of information about falsifying the IDENTIFYING information, which I fully understand, but I do not see anything about ADDRESSES - or, rather, to be more specific, the information relating me to the address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for why I don't have information tying me here, I don't live here permanently - I'm on vacation for an extended period every so often, which is possible with my employment. I don't ever stay here long enough to have reason to get a local ID, or to pay rent, but I do stay long enough to want my mail forwarded. Since I am neither technically a resident, and I also wouldn't have any valid proof (taxes or utilities) to prove that I require a valid DL or strictly an ID... I can't get one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm never comfortable with someone else seeing my mail, and bills and things tend to lead to questions that I don't feel others have a right to know or question. In addition, this residence is a high rise, packages that don't fit in the (small) boxes get signed and received by the addending guard at the desk, and my name not being on the box would also risk having some mail undelivered (and/or draws attention to the non-resident AND the resident). Having a post office box, that I've no mind paying for continuously, would be beneficial, but all of the new rules make getting one a little fishy when maintaining a permenant residence hasn't been a habit in the recent past.

    Vendor side aint an issue for me. It's more a question of the obtaining of the post office box.

    I've gotten 15 year old kids PO boxes.  I've gotten many PO boxes with required ID (vehicle registration or property lease) that was 5 to 6 years old.  I have also gotten people PO boxes with expired voter registration cards.  If you they don't let you get it at one, then go to another.  You can also go back another day and try your luck with someone else.  I've had more than 80 PO boxes in the last decade.  I currently have eleven or twelve.

    Yea, thats the way I saw it, I just occasionally get caught up in a little bit of.. "Well, I want it to be true, so why the hell not!" and like a good reality check every so often. Thanks!

    For shits and giggles and since I assume the post office here is going to be entertaining I think I'll mention my experience when I go tomorrow.
