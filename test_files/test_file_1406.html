    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to ship 1-2oz of bud to friends in Greece &amp; Sweden. I got moisture barrier bags &amp; vacuum bags. What would be the best way to package this I noticed people mention that they compress bud for international. How flat should it be? I'm from Canada so wondering if this should stick to some specific shipping method for safety reasons?

    I have seen some vendors from Canada package bud uncompressed in MBB, concealed within a legitimate product that was then rewraped with an industrial plastic wrap machine to appear as if it came directly from the factory. A plastic wrapping machine may be quite expensive.... but there are many other ways you might could do it. With bud, if they x-ray it, they will most likely find it, though they also might not. If you disguise it legitimately enough as a real product and make it look untampered, then it should get through just fine.

    I personally don't believe all mail is x-rayed, unless it's a very strict country like Germany. I also have never shipped to Greece or Sweden so I don't know how good their customs are. Just do the best you can to disguise it within/as a legitimate product as possible. I personally do not believe bud ever has to be compressed if packaged correctly... besides nobody likes compressed weed.... so ugly.
