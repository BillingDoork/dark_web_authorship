    hey.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is prolly nbd, but i've successfully had plenty of shipments of various things, and i finally had my first "lost in the mail" scare. fortunately it's only two pills worth of viagra (i had a couple of bitcoins that needed spending in my account), and the seller is being totally cool about resending (i wouldn't have complained and screwed up my rating anyway so big ups to angelina), but now i'm worried.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there's so much more that i want to buy but i'm scared my address has been flagged. any advice? consolation? thoughts?

    if you are freaking out over 2 viagra pills going missing SR is probably not the place for you. Having SR on your computer is riskier then being caught with a few viagra

    Hey all!
    <br/>
    I had a few similar shipments disappear right around the same time I switched to a new envelope style. The thickness is right on the edge between mail classes and I believe the post office returned a few for incorrect postage, even though it was correct. However, the return address is a place where I know they will be destroyed upon receipt, so there is zero risk of a discovery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes I wish we could use UPS or FedEx in this business, but unfortunately USPS is the best we can do securely  :o

    It's the least I can do!!! So frustrating for everyone involved though when there's a shipping issue  :-\
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've sent so many of these successfully that I have no concern that the USPS cares in the slightest, fortunately. Also this particular item doesn't even rank in terms of something a postal inspector or DEA would be interested in.
