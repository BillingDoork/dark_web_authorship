    Ok so I've placed about 6 orders on the silk road with no problem mostly rc's and mdma. I've been kinda skeptical of ordering stuff that is able to be smelled by a drug dog like coke and cannabis. I'm only planning on ordering like a gram of cocaine. Should I be worried about ordering this or am I just overthinking it?

    Most drug sniffing K9s are trained to smell MDMA and they are quite good at it.  You already got MDMA so why not get some expensive blow?  Just order from a reputable vendor with good stealth.

    I didn't know they could detect mdma. Thanks for the information ill defnatly look into getting some though. I'm not very experienced with stimulants only tried coke a handful of times. The more and more I talk to people about the euphoria you get with the clear headspace I want to get my hands on some.

    Stealth seems to work pretty well, I've never had hard or soft not show up. If you can find a good vendor, it should make it.

    US-&gt;US make it through 99.9% of the time, as long as the vendors stealth isn't garbage. As far as I am aware, domestic USA packages never even go through drug dogs. I have seen some pretty shitty package that has made it through US-&gt;US where you could smell the substance if you sniffed hard enough on the edge of the box...Just go with a good vendor and if you are concerned ask them about their stealth.
