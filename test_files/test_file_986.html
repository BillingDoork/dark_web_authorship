    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if the new body scanners would detect stuff that's "up your bum"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A friend is planning a trip EU-&gt;US and was wondering if he'd be safe just bringing a bit of hash and few pills up his crack?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He's done this lots of times, but not sure bout scanners and US customs. Regular guy, regular flight from mainland EU.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers

    If it's a full body X-ray scanner like they have at some of the new airports, then yes. They will see everything in and on your body.
    <br/>
    Good thing is most airports randomly select people to go in the full body one instead of the metal detector, but that's a risk I don't recommend taking.

    The X-ray scanners yes obviously.  They are the ones that you stand in between two rectangular boxes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The millimeter wave scanner, the tube like machine you stand in and the scanner arms go up and down on only highlight external objects on your body.  It can't see what is inside your ass or stomach only what is around your skin.  I snuck a couple grams of coke in a baggie by putting it under my foot but obviously with the sock on.  I was scared damn.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look it up on google.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The X-ray machine is called backscatter.

    You do realize that the body scanners are optional? All you have to do is ask to be manually searched. I have had the search completed while I had cannabis on my person. Know your rights and stand up for the Constitution.

    That would be a better idea if you stuck the stuff up your ass or ate it.  I obviously had it easily accessible in my sock so yeah..

    As ruby123 said, you can opt out of the scan and request a pat down.  I last did this at Denver International Airport and want to add this additional bit of info: the pat down is done with the officer wearing rubber gloves.  At the completion of the pat down the gloves are removed and tested for trace chemicals.  I have no idea what chemicals are being analyzed.  It may only be chemicals associated with explosives, or it may include other illegal substances.  I would advise being freshly showered and wearing freshly laundered clothing.

    I agree, the risk really outweighs the reward, but I don't think it's a money issue, but a convenience one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As it has been stated OP, you CAN opt out of the scanner and it doesn't raise red flags. Many legit passengers with nothing to hide refuse because it is incredibly invasive, and other people are wigged out by the potential radiation/cancer, etc. So, if your friend is going to have hash shoved up his ass (and you then want to use it, too LOL) then opt out of the scanner and get wanded/patted down. I would just be sure that it is smell proofed, because if for any reason there is suspicion then they could order a body examination I believe (at least in the USA).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But man, 7 hour flight with ass hash... you sure you or your friend want that after he lands??  :o lol

    If your friend is from the EU, he shouldn't worry about finding drugs in the states.I personally wouldn't fuck with US customs as a non citizen.You probably will get away with it, especially personal amounts, but the hassle to me is enough of a deterrence.Just order off of the SR to your hotel? Being a non citizen will magnify any potential problems.I have brought back Cuban cigars and Absinthe a few times before the alcohol was legalized, through US customs, but those items wouldn't be too serious of a deal if they were to be discovered....One thing to remember to anyone who brings personal amounts of drugs on planes, is that you will be charged by state laws (not Federal) of the airport in question. For me traveling with a personal amounts of cannabis isn't a big deal, even if being caught. I never really gave a shit and if you were in Colorado flying through Denver you have nothing to worry about &lt; 1oz..I can't wait until cannabis is legalized, so we can stop all of the bullshit.

    Make sure you coat the package in a thick layer of bees wax (melted on), by thick, I mean about 3 mm, bees wax stops any nasty smells permeating through the wrapping, I have found that even if you put a lot of layers of cling film, your weed will still absorb a shitty smell, use bees wax and it will be as fresh as when you first got it! Also bees wax is great for an added protection if you decide to swallow the weed instead.
