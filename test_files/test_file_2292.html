    How did your vendor ship it? was it with delivery conformation? Maybe he forgot to wave the signature?

    My own personal policy is NEVER to sign anything. No one on here should be sending you anything you need to sign for, and, it's sign number one of a controlled delivery. If you have to sign on your next package, my advice ...refuse it. Talk to your sender before hand and make sure they didn't do ship it to request a sig.

    well im assuming he forgot to waive the signature. i just think if i had something they knew was drugs they wouldnt just give it to me with no issue because i can get rid of the evidence before anything could be proved. i just over think it but sometimes thats a good thing

    Fucking christ, I'm glad I saw this thread.

    Blunts, you're lucky in that it was not a controlled delivery. Or it doesn't appear to have been, at least. In a controlled delivery, an under cover postal inspector(mail-cop) will ask you to sign for the package, demand to see your ID before letting you sign(may be phrased as a gentle request), accept your signature which counts as proof that you have now received illegal drugs, then they will sit back for an amount of time, which may be quite variable, to give you enough time to open your package. After this variable amount of time, they will serve up a search warrant for your location, as they are now certain you are knowingly holding illegal drugs on the premises. This is, as far as I've read, typically done within an hour to negate any chance of the drugs being disposed of or secretly passed off to someone else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what you should do is contact the vendor immediately and get him to tell you EVERYTHING about why he had to sign for it. If the vendor sent it without a signature required, you need to flush your everything illegal/suspicious down the drain as soon as you can.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason a controlled delivery can occur is a package may have gotten flagged as suspicious, which results in it being set aside to get some attention from a drug dog. Should the dog get too friendly with the package, LE gets a warrant to inspect the package on the inside, which they document in exacting detail, to find if there are any drugs. In the event of discovering drugs, they may or may not remove a portion(depending on drug-value and amount) then continue with the delivery via the above controlled delivery method. Special warning; IF SOMETHING SMELLS LIKE DRUGS, LE WILL JUST GET A WARRANT TO SEARCH THE DESTINATION-ADDRESS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Additional Warning: The step-by-step exact detail is just my conjecture on how a CD will go, in the event that one occurs.

    Being cautious is never a bad thing, but still you should be careful, and in the future what i would do to maintain safety is sat it down next to the door after you sign for it, and write on it in big black marker "return to sender" and take plenty of pictures of it, and let it sit for a while so if they do kick in your door, you can just say, "i been meaning to take that package back to the post office cause its not for me", and make sure no other drugs are in the house period... or still write on it return to sender put it in the car and head towards the post office, and if your stopped for a traffic violation "cause more than likely they been watching you" just say you were headed to the post office cause this package isnt for you, but if your not stopped and no1 follows you, you'll at least have a semi clean conscious about it

    I will say, that XPRESS Post from Canada usually requires a signature.  Any vendor worth their salt will have this somewhere on their page on the main site.  I had to sign for something from lexq earlier this week, and the postman knocked mad loud.  Scared the shit out of me.  I totally forgot that lexq was sending it express (thanks again to them, btw).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Luckily, other folks in the house were receiving packages that day too (non-SR) so I hope it didn't stand out too much.

    It can be like this...
    <br/>
    LE opens your package containing illegal stuffs then they re-package and send you the shit then they wait so you sign and take the package then they come and your busted  ;D
