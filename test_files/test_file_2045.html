    Does anyone know if it's ok to stick it on the envelope inside, or do you place it on the back of the envelope. Surely you're not supposed to stick it to the plastic part of the envelope?  Any advice will be greatly appreciated.. I've searched the world over for the answer to my question, yet, it eludes me.

    The DCN sticker can be on the inside or outside but ALL postage must be put on the outside. I usually put the DCN vertical on the right side of the envelope. Any postage that is on the actual envelope WILL NOT be counted.

    +1 That was my assumption, but I searched the world over and couldn't find a clear answer. Thanks so much.

    I would do it the same way Foxymeow does it. I place it in the same way on flat rate envelopes.

    That's where I always have. Brilliant minds think alike ;-) I just didn't want something to bite me in the ass as I've tweaked a few things in my shipping methods. Anywho, thanks so much again, guys.

    You are probably better off putting it horizontally. However, the most important thing is to put the postage on the outside.
