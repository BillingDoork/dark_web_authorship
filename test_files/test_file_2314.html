    So, after weeks of waiting on a particular order from the UK I receive this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=122436fca0c1d61846583df18257c5db.jpg
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is a scanned image of the letter I received. It states that the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) has my package but is requesting my permission to open it because it is under 30 grams in weight. They have given me 30 days to do this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously I'm not giving them permission do to shit, because fuck those cunts, but I found it odd that they would even give me a chance to do so. I've never received a letter for my orders before, in fact, just last week I received two separate orders originating from the Netherlands, a much higher profile country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I ordered: 10x 25i/25c-NBOMe combo gel caps (400/200 micrograms of substance contained respectively in each cap)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Questions I have:
    <br/>
    a) Once this request expires after 30 days, and it gets sent to Canada Post to "be dealt with in accordance with the regulations", will Canada Post proceed to open it anyway?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    b) Could I expect a visit from any LE in a months time for such a small amount?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    c) Does anyone even know the scheduled status of NBOMe's in Canada? Shit is so fuzzy and difficult to find.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    d) Will my current name/address be forever scrutinized on international mail? Future home addresses too?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you for any answers or other related advice you can give me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regards,
    <br/>
    A Canadian friend.

    That is fucked!!! I would not call..I would not write...I would pretend I never got the letter in the first place...
    <br/>
    I doubt that they will come arrest you for 10 caps but anything is possible although it was never in your possession so i don't know what they can charge you with.. Maybe attempting to import an illicit narcotic but I doubt it highly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your address is a whole new ballgame.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assume you can never send anything to your name at any address from outside of our great country... Your name will for sure be on a watch list.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for what they will do with the package.. My guess is they will open it and test the goods.. once they find it to be drugs I assume they will ship it back to its country of origin so LE there can look into it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not to much they can do with it on this side.. thats for sure! maybe pop it and get ripped! lol

    You will be alright.  Just clean house and don't order to the same address again.

    I doubt they will have your "name" on the watchlist.  Some names are too common for them to use this tactic.

    This is tough one. On one hand if your fully cooperative, sign the document and let them open it, it may appear as though you are totally unaware of what has been sent to you (Oh My Goodness! Drugs in the mail!! - Who sent this and why was it addressed to me Constable friendly?!?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other hand if you act like you never received the notice and they open it themselves they will probably be "in touch" with you sooner or later. I doubt they would prosecute you since: A)  You were never in possession of anything illegal, and B) How much effort is it worth to get some guy who may or may not be aware of what was coming and isn't dealing it anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the very least your address is compromised, possibly your name is added to some red flag database. Be careful ordering in the future. Personally, I always order domestically and never use international mailings.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck and keep us updated on what happens brother.

    This is CBSA protocol. They have a lot of packages coming in that are illegal to import, especially pharmaceuticals ordered by elderly people, and of course people of all ages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ignore the message and the lettermail will be destroyed, don't respond as others have said (I'm sure 20 other people who got the same letter that day also ignored it hehe). I've had a friend's address receive 2 CBSA seizure letters, and many parcels still fly right thru without being touched. The CBSA isn't too hardcore, but if you're talking about false documents and things like that then that's quite a bit more serious than controlled substances (which come in many times per day).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't worry, but also since this is a request I'm unfamiliar with, I would consider your address flagged for now. Maybe make a few international, legal purchases and see if they get held up by customs, or checked at all.

    I know it's not technically illegal to send money in the mail but wouldn't it be very easy for them to detect cash in the mail using RFID scanners? I could be wrong but I've heard many times that certain denominations of US currency contain RFID tags.

    The city I live in is approaching ~1million people, so pretty big for Canada. The drugs aren't vials either, just -00- size gelatin capsules and they weigh very minimally (only 600 ug of active drugs in each). The last order I received from that vendor it was just a small padded mailer, no bigger than a birthday card envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the info Regicide, I'm thinking I'm just unlucky like that. The vendor already re-sent another envelope so if it doesn't arrive in 2 weeks I'm going to assume this address is fucked. I'll clean my computer anyway, deny everything if asked about anything, and lay low for a few months if that's the case. I'll update the situation when it's resolved. :)

    Welp, the vendor reship from the UK arrived, in just about only ~5 business days too. Granted, I received tabs this time instead of gel caps so it was a flat envelope instead of a padded mailer, but I guess that means I'm not on too close of a watch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully they just destroy my previous order and leave me alone. ;D I am moving in a month though, so I'll just play it safe and lay low until I get my new address anyway. Thank you all, I'll let you know if I get busted in the future lol.

    'no clue' is fuckin right. RC's aren't illegal everywhere now just cuz ppl know about them or some magic happened... Certain ones get banned, most stay legal. The rate of new RCs being marketed to the rate being banned per year is like 5:1. And that's just the US/UK. Most other places, like Canada, don't usually ban new chems until way way after the US and UK have taken the lead on that. The NBOMe's aren't illegal in Canada. In fact Im not aware of a single country where a single NBOMe is illegal right now. Surely they'll be banned eventually due to the ODs and deaths that have been happening from 25i-nbome, but it hasn't happened yet anywhere.

     I know it's not technically illegal to send money in the mail but wouldn't it be very easy for them to detect cash in the mail using RFID scanners? I could be wrong but I've heard many times that certain denominations of US currency contain RFID tags.

    There's no RFID chips in US currency. It's a myth.

    Probably Class III. Other similar drugs are.  Simple possession is max 18 months. But I don't know what the normal actions might be.

    Ignore this evidence if it can't e supported. I believe nBOMe is unerstricted in Canada at present.
