    I have a question i was hoping someone could help with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i know Xray's can't scan through lead and i was watching a show the other night that had a painting done by Da Vinci, the painting was painted in normal paint except for one angel in the picture which was painted in lead based paint. when this painting was xrayed everything came up except for the angel painted with lead paint.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my question is, if i was to post something that was obscured by the lead painting, would the xray machine be able to detect my item trying to hide behind the lead painting?

    Interesting question. I don't know the answer, but where would you even find lead based paint anymore? China? :P

    Of course it wouldn't be detected but whats the point? One tries to make the letter/package look as ordinary as possible. Any hidden object is suspicious. put yourself in shoes of a custom officer and try thinking as they do. According to your way of thinking we would live in a very dangerous place. Imagine you could send explosives etc only because they are covered with led shit or similar. Naaaah, thats no good method.

    It was just a thought, it would be interesting to see how it would look through X-ray though, on th show i was watching it said that the picture painted in lead painting became invisable rather than nontransperent.

    Why to complicate. Some people are using black paper like they use in photography to safeguard the film rolls not being exposed to light, they also protect from x-rays but whats the point? Take such a protective bag which doesn't allow x-rays to penetrate the content. Wouldn't you be curious whats inside?

    Use lead foil. 3M and Alcoa both make it. Google it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I agree that it is best to make a package as inconspicuous as possible .
