    are you a carrier or someone who works in a PO or sort facility?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i have some questions on electronic shipping information. when you stick a 400 label on a package it doesnt show up in the tracking system until the first scan. when you print an e-label (with or without postage) the information gets sent to USPS tracking system and will show as "electronic information received" before the first scan.  what exactly is the e-shipping information that is stored? does that e-tracking number have the source/destination embedded into it for query into the database? or is it just the tracking number &amp; scan information saved for query?

    I would be careful, since he's asking for money up front and hasn't shown any insider knowledge of USPS operations. You can find other threads where people have offered seemingly reliable info for free.

    Hey welcome to the forum.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a question and an answer to your question.
    <br/>
    1. I have successfully received normal white commercial envelopes with a business company printed on the letter (you know like the transparent part on the face of the envelope where you can see the address and company on the letter head). I have also successfully received yellow bubble envelopes with a printed label on the outside of the letter.
    <br/>
    Which one do you think looks less suspicious?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. For monetisation you could maybe setup as a vendor here and sell consultation for vendors. This is the only anonymous way of making money imo. In real life you might be able to benefit if you ever decide to become a drug vendor yourself and maybe you can bypass some of the security in the postal system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    no no no, i'm just thinking about ways i could make extra money by being on the inside. i've thought of plenty of ways, but they all would involve disclosing where my route is (i have a regular route) to a third party, and i don't trust anyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i certainly have no problem leaving packages at vacant houses, or simply scanning something as delivered and taking them myself, but using that to facilitate anonymous transport would again involve disclosing the location of my route to the mailer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'm not a thief, though, and i have no interest in stealing other people's stuff. that would be easy as shit... but i am a moral person...

    postal inspectors seem to ask questions about certain customers in our large office maybe once a year, but they don't really say why except in a roundabout way. i've never seen anything big go down. it's usually fraud i think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i've neither seen nor heard of drugs/contraband being found at our office. seriously, nobody gives a shit about domestic mailings. as long as it doesn't bust open and something incriminating comes tumbling or leaking out, nobody cares.

    1. are you talking about domestically mailed stuff? if so, use whatever. nobody gives a shit. as a delivery person, handwritten stuff stands out a little more to the eye, but nothing is going to happen unless it busts open and it looks noticeably illegal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. i don't really think i have enough info to consult... but dealing in bulk would be pretty easy for me actually. i can get large packages into the mailstream anonymously. but i'm not sure i want to go down that road.

    it archives the address info whether or not you actually purchase the postage... the point of the whole thing is to know who you are, actually.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it does record it even if it's under 13 ounces, also. but, with something that size you can just slap stamps on it and chuck it in a blue mailbox and it will be fine.

    this crap is all since 9/11. ostensibly it's for anti-terrorism.

    also, to everyone who receives a lot of packages, do your best to make it look like you're an e-bay addict. there are a LOT of those who receive all kinds of hand-addressed parcels daily. in fact, if i were you i'd order cheap crap off of e-bay very frequently to mix it up and look more legit. a lot of people have hobbies and order tons of things like, say, toy trains or vintage dolls or whatever frequently.

    i can't imagine express mail getting any more scrutiny, perhaps even less... we are frantically trying to get them to where they're supposed to be on time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the impression i'm getting from you guys in this thread is you worry way more than you should about us... we just want to get stuff to its destination as soon as possible. you'd have to be doing something really really weird regularly to raise any eyebrows. customs is the only place that would cause me concern.

    Pretty sure this is a dumb question, but you guys don't handle international shipments at all then, even mail? Does it go through your same 'check' system (which you say is pretty DGAF), or how does that mail differ from domestic? Apologize in advance if this question is too noob :/.

    no, we deal with millions of international parcels, but there is no procedure domestically to scrutinize anything beyond making sure it has the proper postage (well, there is an anthrax sniffer, and i sure as hell hope you aren't doing that... and media mail, which is often checked to make sure it is actually media... but that's it.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    once something clears customs and is given to us, it's treated just like anything else. which is to say, it's not scrutinized as long as it's not leaking something.

    Couldn't you make money by ordering drugs to someone on your route, and just pocket the letter when you are delivering it? Of course you would have to be the only person delivering your route, but if you are I see no downside to this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - The recipient wouldn't know a thing.
    <br/>
    - If it would be CD:d, it would have been intercepted before you and you wouldn't be in trouble at all. Plus, the recipient would be in a good position to deny as they really did not even order.
    <br/>
    - If it slips through, the no one would suspect you.
    <br/>
    - You could order international bulk with very low risk. Int package would be easy to recognize (coming from say Belgium), and if it were intercepted at customs you would not be delivering it without knowing it was caught, you would be CD:ing it with police support (or they'd do it themselves) and you'd be clear.

    Oh one last crazy question. If I pulled 9 random packages/envelopes out of your mail bag and slipped in one SR order. (Using advice on how an order should be sent from these very forums) Do you think you could pick it out of the 10 within 10sec if you had 2 chances.?

    Yeah, I could do those things, really... we (mail carriers) are in a position of trust and are looked at as helpers for investigations and such rather than suspects. I've had packages I've left on porches go missing (or at least reported to have gone missing by the customer) and never once have I been treated as under scrutiny. Anything mailed to my route is at some point going to be privately under my control. But on further reflection, I don't think I have the stomach for any of this... not that I think I would get caught, I just don't have the drive to become a vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah, incoming international once it has entered our mailstream isn't treated any differently from domestic mail.

    How do you feel about narcotics being delivered via post? How do other post carriers feel? Is it something that is widely known and accepted or do most have the opinion it is rare?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does international packages coming to an address suddenly and frequently raise and red flags with a carrier? Would carriers care enough to report such behavior?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In your opinion what is the general consesnsous about drug use amongst carriers, do most of you guys get together and smoke a spliff together or are most really against it?

    Regarding names, this is really the tricky part. Your regular mailman will know your name and will likely be given pause when a new, random name shows up. Not a suspicious pause, but one of, "hmm, i wonder if i should leave this or not?" because wouldn't want to leave something that was incorrectly addressed. Some mailmen might bring it to your door to ask if it's for you... which i'm sure would make you a little uncomfortable. others either don't care or just assume it's for someone you know, and just leave it. A few morons might actually send it back if your name is the only one that's been at that address for a long period of time. Doubtful, but it happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't want to use your name, I would probably get a test letter or package sent first with that name to see what your mailman does with it. Alternatively you could just have it addressed to "Dad" or "Awesome Dude" or something cute on it, which some people do... the mailman would just assume it's yours without any reason to think otherwise.

    Theft happens as it does in any organization but it's not an epidemic or anything. I've never known of any cases personally where someone was suspected of it. And then it's typically Christmas/Birthday money being pulled out of greeting cards. Parcel theft is pretty rare as far as I can tell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your crazy question... I'm not sure how you guys go about mailing it. If you give me a specific type of package/postage/addressing style I can tell you if it would seem odd or not.

     Hey Rambler:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     How do you feel about narcotics being delivered via post? How do other post carriers feel? Is it something that is widely known and accepted or do most have the opinion it is rare?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Does international packages coming to an address suddenly and frequently raise and red flags with a carrier? Would carriers care enough to report such behavior?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In your opinion what is the general consesnsous about drug use amongst carriers, do most of you guys get together and smoke a spliff together or are most really against it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks for taking the time to answer some questions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While you may not make much, setting up an anonymous wallet for bitcoin and posting the address may earn you some tips.

    It doesn't cross my mind or anyone else's mind, really. We know it happens but it's likely an extremely small percentage of packages and not worth even thinking about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Psshht! People order so much shit online these days that we're bombarded with international packages given online shopping and ebay or what not. Nobody notices or cares. Every route has a dozen or so people on it who get all kinds of shit from overseas several times a week. I'm sure most of it is just collectibles and electronics and (legal?) nutritional products and what not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plenty of carriers smoke up, but not while working. I've known some who will do harder stuff sometimes but as long as it's not affecting work performance than it's just whatever.

    Now my question:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Several years ago I had about 3k stolen from one of those mailbox stores like mailboxes etc. USPS recommended I should file a police report before filing a report with them. Since this was legitimate business, I went to make a police report and all they did was essentially accuse me of dealing drugs. That taught me the police are shitbags not worth going to for help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That aside, who was more likely to steal my mail? A carrier or the store personnel? I figured that a carrier has too much to lose if they decide to open their mail. They possibly lose job, criminal charges and certainly don't have the time to open every piece of mail they carry or else it would never get delivered. My thoughts lie with the store cunt as the one who got it.

    To the post above yours, I haven't heard anything about warrants not being needed for express mail. That sounds a bit unlikely to me but that's really a question regarding other law enforcement agencies I think. We're concerned about parcel safety (i.e., no dangerous mailings like explosives) and there's no organizational focus on finding contraband.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm almost 100% sure there isn't a searchable database of any kind. They have to do a lot of digging to find a record of any particular mailing. But if you're under investigation for something, your incoming mail is being recorded by hand.

    Mailboxes Etc. type businesses are in no way associated with us at USPS. We just drop off the mail there and then it's their problem. Personally I think you'd be better off with a genuine PO Box at a post office, where a postal service inspector would get involved with theft if you wanted them to. They take internal theft seriously but usually it's hard to catch someone unless that person gets greedy and is stealing stuff frequently. It's almost always sorters at the plant who do steal stuff, because they deal with massive amounts of mail going all over the place while it is known exactly what route a mailman was on that day, so if a particular mailman has stuff going missing with some frequency, they're going to draw scrutiny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How obvious was it that there was cash in it? Definitely don't send it in anything that would give it away that there might be a lot of cash in there. Temptation might get the best of someone if they could figure it out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I would bet a lot of money that it was the mailboxes etc. type place that stole it. They have privacy to steal and more intimate knowledge of your particular mail. Honestly I would avoid those types of places.

    Yah I know the mailbox stores aren't USPS boxes. Various reasons why I had to use the mailbox store; too many to list here. The business I was in at the time was legal but 'shady' so I couldn't use a genuine PO Box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The mail was coming from several different areas of the US so it's unlikely that a mail sorter got it. I lost several envelopes the same week they should have come into the box. What mail did arrive in the box, some of them were tampered with. One was a money order so they opened the envelope, saw it was a money order and left it alone. It was OBVIOUS the letter had been opened and resealed. A couple of them were like that. Also, I called the store and told them I had been expecting mail that didn't arrive. Suddenly the next day when I checked the box there was another tampered envelope dated 3 days before the other ones were. Someone had been hiding it; maybe to look through later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The store may have been served by a contracting rural carrier; not sure. I'm also not sure how stealthy some of the cash was sent but quite likely one of them was obvious cash which tipped someone off to look at all of the mail. I think it was either the carrier or the store but I've suspected it was the store because I've never had any trouble anywhere else I've done cash in the mail work. My buyers wanted anonymity so no tracking would have been used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3k is a felonious amount of theft and I wanted to see someone burn for it but after being accused of drug dealing I dropped the matter. Police aren't a help ever; that's all I learned out of the deal.

    Do addresses get flagged if a package is intercepted say at customs or domestically? And if so how long is it flagged for? Also if you used a name that isn't tied to the address in anyway, is it the name and/or the address that is flagged.

    it's almost definitely theft by one of these too, but i'd suspect the mailbox store most of all. but i understand why you'd want to avoid the p.o. directly sometimes. but i'd generally distrust non-postal hands touching your mail when possible. that doesn't at all sound like what would happen if you were under investigation. someone was just stealing your stuff.

    your address would only be flagged under the instructions of an outside law enforcement agency... it's a very rare occurrence and i'm sure customs seizure alone would not initiate that given the large amount of stuff seized by customs. you'd have to be under serious monitoring by a three letter agency for that to happen.

    Okay, once and for all...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is the best best format to address something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS website says one thing, vendors sometimes recommend different things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some say use all caps (but this may stand out more)
    <br/>
    some say use country line (even if domestically)
    <br/>
    some say use 9 digit zip while others say this is not necessary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is a fine line between making your address label as professional as possible to ensure no minor hiccups are going to cause something to go wrong; and making your label look *too* good...almost suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one more personal question if you dont mind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Were you on SR before you became a mailman or a mailman before SR?

     <br/>
     <br/>
     What is the best best format to address something?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     USPS website says one thing, vendors sometimes recommend different things.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some say use all caps (but this may stand out more)
     <br/>
     some say use country line (even if domestically)
     <br/>
     some say use 9 digit zip while others say this is not necessary.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There is a fine line between making your address label as professional as possible to ensure no minor hiccups are going to cause something to go wrong; and making your label look *too* good...almost suspicious.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     one more personal question if you dont mind.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Were you on SR before you became a mailman or a mailman before SR?

    Don't put the country if it is being mailed domestically. That just looks weird.
    <br/>
    Don't use a 9 digit zip if it's handwritten, that also looks weird. It's never necessary, by the way.
    <br/>
    I don't think there's any one "right" or "wrong" format for addressing it. We get so many packages in so many different formats that nothing much stands out. People mail a lot of personal items to family that is hand addressed from all over, not to mention stuff from eBay that is amateurishly packed in different ways also. If I was mailing a bubble-envelope of some sort I would probably hand address it in large print with a permanent marker. There's lots of stuff sent like that. Usually stuff is either A) Hand-written or B) Using an official print-out from our website. I'm guessing most of you don't use B), so I wouldn't hesitate at all to hand-write it. Use a large, legible print in a marker that won't run much if wet and make sure it's addressed properly, 5 digit zip code is fine. If you do print your own label (this is fine too, really, there are plenty of them also but "proprietary" labels are less common than USPS website labels or hand-written ones) make sure not to use an exposed inkjet printout. If they get wet, the ink will run profusely and could even obliterate the address!! Use clear packaging tape over the label if you must use inkjet.
    <br/>

    I was a mail carrier before SR existed. I've been an SR customer for a while though.

    Users, be wary of attributing undue expertise when assessing important information. I assure you that some of the points in this thread are being poorly represented. Consider that Express parcels are absolutely more scrutinized. The more expensive it was to mail, the more it will stand out.

    Here's a bit of advice that JanetReno posted maybe a year and a half, almost two years ago:

    **  If a postal inspector asks you if the drugs are yours, just admit to it and they'll go easy on you. **

      To the post above yours, I haven't heard anything about warrants not being needed for express mail. That sounds a bit unlikely to me but that's really a question regarding other law enforcement agencies I think. We're concerned about parcel safety (i.e., no dangerous mailings like explosives) and there's no organizational focus on finding contraband.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I'm almost 100% sure there isn't a searchable database of any kind. They have to do a lot of digging to find a record of any particular mailing. But if you're under investigation for something, your incoming mail is being recorded by hand.

     Every piece of mail sent in this country is photographed via mail cover indexes. In theory, a Postal Inspector or Fed can literally pull up every mail cover sent to your address. It wouldn't be difficult at all, and backtracking mail covers is one of the easiest ways to bust vendors who don't change return addresses often. So I completely disagree with this answer. They have been using this technique to bust people who mail Obama ricin. They flagged every letter sent within that time period and did some analysis and got a suspect. The answer SilkRoadRambler provided is incorrect. Not trying to sound like a dick but you actually haven't posted a single thing that I already don't know about USPS.

    I never said it was impossible, but it would take digging and would be time consuming. I don't believe that there is anywhere where someone can type in an address into a database and up will pop pictures of every incoming piece of mail.  However, I have personally seen all items addressed to an individual address be hand photocopied at my office every morning because they were under an investigation of some sort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, if you know more than I do, there isn't a point in me being here. I've just been passing the time.

    I have a few questions about label 400s. Do they keep track of what batches go to what POs? Why do they come off of the roll in a sequence of +7? Where do the six in between go? The reason I ask is I have gotten two full packages of the booklets of 50 from different( but close proximity) POs and they both had the exact same stickers on them, all the way down  to the contract no. But I have also gotten a full roll, in the box but this had an identical sticker with the exception of the contract no. Is the difference just because one is in packets and one is a roll? Or are each PO supposed to get its own contract no.? So I guess my real question is can they track the label 400s to the specific PO it came from?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also how much attention is paid to where the label 400 came from compared to where the package using that label originates from? Like if the labels can be traced back to the PO it came from(which i think is possible) would it raise a red flag if someone affixes it to a package half way across the country.

    My father retired from USPS after 30 years and for the last 5 years he worked express exclusively. Express does get more attention. He told me many times that postal inspectors would come in his office and ask about packages and even take a few for a short time.
    <br/>
    He said they would very carefully open the packages and repackage them back up to where you would have no idea they were ever opened to begin with. I remember specifically him telling me about a case they were building on a mailer from Texas shipping cocaine. They let packages get through a few times but were documenting and building a strong case the entire time.

    Heres the mailman saying nobody gives a shit,  wheres RXKing he will love this.  I have no clue why vendors on here a) encrypt messages b) think priority mail for some amazingly off reason I still dont understand is safer and express mail is out of the question of course.  Im not sure if its misinformation or people are just paranoid over weird things.  I never even use privnote when i order, unless the vendor happens to be someone i havent ordered from ill just humor them, but its just really ridiculous.

    It does seem like some people are asking a local delivery person about things that happen in sorting facilities and other distant facilities. For instance, I would like to know if USPS tracks the tracking label numbers that they send out so they know what address/account they sent each number to. I would not expect a local delivery person to know that though. As for scrutiny of Express vs. Priority, I also think that kind of scrutiny happens away from the local post offices. So, I think this mailperson would not be likely know about usps scrutiny levels in the places we need to know about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buying the 400 labels on SR is very risky since you have to give out an address to a seller that could easily be LE. Especially if the seller has no reputation. So, I'm not sure it would be easy to make $ from selling them here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would love to have a friend in the USPS. I just don't see a safe way to meet them on SR. You might comment on how you think we could approach individuals at our local USPS offices or mailpersons to develop a friendship? Stalk them? ;-)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for PO boxes, I think getting one at USPS requires high quality ID. I think that may be a primary reason we avoid them. Other PO box places may tighten up their ID requirements over time as well though. If you know details about ID requirements, that might be nice to hear about.

    +1 to OP for sharing info with the community.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I appreciate the effort to contribute, and the fact that someone else may have said something similar in some other thread (now probably buried under a bunch of "MY BITCOINS DIDN"T ARRIVE IN MY SR ACCOUNT AND IT"S BEEN 10 MINUTES!!!!!" posts) is no reason to crap on what's being said here. Important issues *should* be rediscussed and rehashed, not only for the benefit of those who have already been through similar discussions but also for the benefit of newer members who may not have been around for prior iterations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What we have here is a (presumably) front-line postal carrier telling us that USPS worker-bees don't give a fuck about the details of your individual package and don't have time to give a shit whether the box you're getting contains a few grams of weed or a replacement window crank for your 1968 Dodge Dart. That sounds very reasonable to me, and correlates with what I feel I've seen elsewhere on this forum. That doesn't mean that everyone should abandon all forms of operational security, but it does supply some context for a very important piece of the environment in which we operate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything we read on  SR forums should be taken worth a grain of salt, but everything we read here can be integrated into what hopefully becomes a holistic picture of some version of reality.

     Question:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When a mail carrier scans a USPS tracker, does it involve any sort of GPS coding like UPS uses? This would essentially tip off anyone using tracking to the exact drop boxes they use and actually link USPS trackers with physical addresses, so this question has been on my mind for a bit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Question:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Do you, as a USPS employee consider vendors who use USPS Click and Ship to print tracking labels a security risk? The act of using Click and Ship stores customer information in an off-site database run by the US government. Do you know anything extraordinary in regards to Click and Ship posting? The information is retained indefinitely? Sounds like a bad idea in my opinion.

    I'm not butthurt so much as I don't give a shit. I don't expect a tip from anyone. I have noticed a few people have done so and it's a very nice gesture and I thank them. I started a thread out of a fit of boredom in case anyone had a questions for your average mailman out of a large urban post office. That and the latest government crackdown on private communications has led me to want to fight back a little to the small extent I might be able to. But if all the basic info is available around here otherwise, then that's awesome and I'll leave. I genuinely haven't read the other threads so I have no clue as to what they say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As to your questions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Our scanners have no GPS devices. We're much lower tech than UPS or FedEx, especially in that department. No address is even recorded if there was no signature obtained, just a record of it being scanned as "Delivered" at a particular time by a particular scanner.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure exactly what you mean on your second question set... A security risk to SR vendors, you mean? I will say if I was a SR vendor I sure as hell wouldn't be using a click and ship account! Do you mean there are vendors who use click and ship under their real name here? Never, never would I do that... the info you enter is going to be stored and accessible in any thorough kind of investigation.

     My father retired from USPS after 30 years and for the last 5 years he worked express exclusively. Express does get more attention. He told me many times that postal inspectors would come in his office and ask about packages and even take a few for a short time.

     He said they would very carefully open the packages and repackage them back up to where you would have no idea they were ever opened to begin with.

    Thanks! For those... I'd guess maybe 20% have regular stamps on them. Maybe a little less. But there are hundreds of thousands every day of those still I'm sure. Stamp denominations other than first class are rare, though. That always catches my eye. Personally, if I was mailing a small package anonymously I'd just use the requisite number of first class stamps (the small ones, like 1 or 2 cents are common also)... for instance, if it was $5.20 or something I'd just stick on 10 first class stamps and be done with it.

     I have a few questions about label 400s. Do they keep track of what batches go to what POs? Why do they come off of the roll in a sequence of +7? Where do the six in between go? The reason I ask is I have gotten two full packages of the booklets of 50 from different( but close proximity) POs and they both had the exact same stickers on them, all the way down  to the contract no. But I have also gotten a full roll, in the box but this had an identical sticker with the exception of the contract no. Is the difference just because one is in packets and one is a roll? Or are each PO supposed to get its own contract no.? So I guess my real question is can they track the label 400s to the specific PO it came from?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also how much attention is paid to where the label 400 came from compared to where the package using that label originates from? Like if the labels can be traced back to the PO it came from(which i think is possible) would it raise a red flag if someone affixes it to a package half way across the country.

    You're welcome, and I've been thinking about that myself. I don't know. I'm going to take a look at the supply boxes and labels this week to see what I might be able to figure out. But my hunch is they aren't going to get much (my guess is none) scrutiny as to whether or not they've come from the originating area of distribution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they come in a sequence of +7, I would bet that the other numbers are not legitimate tracking numbers... it's a very crappy "algorithm" so an incorrect tracking number isn't recorded accidentally, I think. I'll play with my scanner sometime this week and see if that's the case. The scanner refuses numbers that aren't "valid", which is based solely on an algorithm like credit cards are. +7 as a pattern wouldn't surprise me.

    There's a thread in the Newbie forum where a person who works in a mail sorting facility was answering questions. He said that express mail was looked at more closely, because employees are under pressure to get the parcel delivered in time, so they look more closely at the address and stuff like that. His advice was that you want each person to handle and look at your package for as little time as possible, so you should go with priority mail.

    They make it seem more likely that postal workers will flag packages than the OP of this thread, maybe because mail carriers care less about the contents of packages than the people in the sorting facilities.

    I'm actually surprised that our website takes pre-paid cards... that kind of defeats the purpose of trying to avoid sending larger stuff anonymously. Still, using the same return address twice EVER sounds like being needlessly reckless to me. Also, using the same pre-paid card more than once ties different shipments together in a trail of electronic records... i.e., if a shipment to someone got busted, even if LE couldn't pin down the originator, they'd be able to know every single recipient based on the purchasing pre-paid card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If any vendor insists on using click-and-ship, I'd only do it as a "one-off", with one click-and-ship account, one return address, and one pre-paid card, ever. It sucks that some vendors seem to be much more reckless with their customers' privacy than their own.

    Another thing you guys might want to look into is that just last week we rolled out a new 2-Day delivery mailing method... I guess you could consider it a priority/express hybrid. UPS and FedEx have 2-Day delivery options and we're trying to keep up with them.

    Here's a question that pops up regularly: when you are doing your deliveries, how much do you care whether the name on the package is the same as the name on the mailbox (or the normal name that gets deliveries to that box)? I assume that the sorters don't give a shit since they can't possibly be sitting there cross checking names and addresses as packages fly by), but what about the guy that's delivering everyday? If a non-standard names appears on a package, do you notice or care? Is there any kind of official USPS policy on that?

    Are you aware of any methods or machines to scan RFID tags placed within USD sent through the mail?I also have a friend who is a mail carrier. I recently asked him about drugs being shipped in the mail. He was pretty emphatic about the amounts being under 4oz. This is because the density of the package would raise flags.He also mentioned that many people are receiving pharmaceuticals in the mail nowadays, so pills are not a red flag necessarily.

    VERY interesting and exciting.  This would be the method I'd like to take advantage of if some vendors start offering this.  Are you sure this isn't "Priority Mail Express" as I'm seeing on the USPS site?  Basically it's just express with a new name and some new perks but it's an over night service.  And then you have priority mail just like before with some added perks.  I'm not seeing this new method on your website.

    I have a question about the 'rigid' part of shipping letters or bubble mailers. I'm only speaking firstclass &amp; stamps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How strict is that rigid definition? A normal flexible 1oz letter is 46c , but a 'rigid' one is 66c. Not a big deal to me but I have been sending what I would personally consider a letter with rigid object. But still bends for the most part, nothing actually solid... just thick paper and maybe some cotton.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the usps site a 4oz bubble mailer parcel service is coming up as 2.09. I thought the price on that is 4 stamps (~1.80). When did this change?

    Hi B.C., I do tend to ramble on.
    <br/>
    I like your posts and meant no disrespect. I think you would have to agree you generally are a know-it-all about this stuff. I suppose I was flicking you a bit of shit because you seemed to be giving the OP a hard time for, seemingly, trying to be helpful.
    <br/>
    I think the USPS would be lucky to have you ;-). I do wonder if you would do well there if you knew more about the place than your bosses. I get the feeling USPS management often has a chip on their shoulder and a lack of knowledge they are comfortable with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, I'd be honored to sell you buds :-) To get super-powered thinking/writing skills like me, though, you would probably need long term exposure to my products and, maybe, to the toxic chemicals growers used to spray buds with (Kelthane for Spider Mites, mostly) and, maybe also, to Liberty Cap mushrooms that may not have been all Liberty Caps, and probably other inappropriate mind altering strategies I have not thought about recently ;-)
    <br/>

    ------
    <br/>
    OP - Thank you for being here and offering information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All - Must realize that the postal system in all countries is very fragmented, especially over in the states. Each part of the system will only know what is going on in that part very well. OP is part of the last mile and knows their job very well. Important information can be gathered from them. But understand the limitations of their knowledge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Postal inspection keeps very tight lid on things from any non inspectors. They will never give up info to carriers or post center persons about the investigation of the methods. Inspectors also get stiff man wood trying to catch carriers stealing mail or other internal infractions. Would suggest OP *NOT* trust *ANYONE* here and give up anything that reveals their route or area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Auto photographing mail , covers, and OCR sorting and video postnet application etc are all sort center level activities and many there are not fully aware of specifics of what happens to data when mail is sorted. They know their job and what they hear or are told. Keeping information close to need to know helps prevent leaks and helps them with opsec. There are person in each part of the chain that know and are aware of all opsec procedures so the rank and file dont need to know and usually dont care because it does not help them get home at end of day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP says they don't give a shit and mostly people here too paranoid. Agree 99% with this. Rank and file, persons handling your mail on day to day basis generally dont give a shit and domestic mail is extremely safe keeping common sense in mind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Must remember most the big seizures you hear about are almost all from OUTSIDE information. Leaks or tips from on going cases, fucking rats snitching out their friends, people getting busted, under cover transactions, secret nsa intercept and tip pass along, etc. If there is no outside tip or existing investigation and your parcel does not smell heavily of drugs or is leaking liquid or ticking, it will be delivered without a problem.  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometime we think nobody really take time to use the brain in the head before asking questions in forum. If you enter information into computer regarding mail assume 100% it is stored and databased forever. Click and ship bad idea, etc. Yes express is looked at more, not by person loading container, but by postal inspectors and LE agencies. A lot of cash is sent express and probably largest focus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP is a good resource but ask relevant question. GPS on scanner was good question. Anything relate to post center operation. Track label, good question there. All carrier should have a book they update for that route with name/address, no?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Investigation start and resolve usual long before reach carrier hand. Carrier would be last to know about it unless they need to give your mail to supervisor daily for local covers intercept.

    I get pharms in the mail every 90 days and there isn't much stealth at all. You can hear the pills rattling around and it's obvious there is a pill container inside. Of course these are coming from a legitimate mail order pharmacy.

     Interesting. I'll check the supply room next week and see how big our stash is. It's not stealing if you guys actually use it! We appreciate your business.

    The post offices have fucking FAT rolls of these, one roll is probably 500 &amp; the roll that used to be available to order from their site.

    Question for OP:  What happens when someone uses an incorrect zip code one digit off when all the other information is correct?  Say my zip is 90210 but I put 90211 and I know that both of those zip codes are handled by the same post office.  Will the package arrive and will there be a delay?

    Is it suspicious to the mail system or flagged if you receive an overnight package from same sender to same receiver every week for lengths at a time? Like one or two overnight packages a week from same sender to same receiver for say 3 months in a row does someone finally say hey lets take at look at this or inspect this a little closer for any reason? thanks

    +1 because I appreciate your input!  Did you ever get the package or was all lost?  I hope that doesn't happen to me because like I had mentioned the zip code I used and the zip code I should have used are both covered by the exact same post office.  I just don't know what other post office the package would even go to.

      I have a few questions about label 400s. Do they keep track of what batches go to what POs? Why do they come off of the roll in a sequence of +7? Where do the six in between go? The reason I ask is I have gotten two full packages of the booklets of 50 from different( but close proximity) POs and they both had the exact same stickers on them, all the way down  to the contract no. But I have also gotten a full roll, in the box but this had an identical sticker with the exception of the contract no. Is the difference just because one is in packets and one is a roll? Or are each PO supposed to get its own contract no.? So I guess my real question is can they track the label 400s to the specific PO it came from?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Also how much attention is paid to where the label 400 came from compared to where the package using that label originates from? Like if the labels can be traced back to the PO it came from(which i think is possible) would it raise a red flag if someone affixes it to a package half way across the country.

      Thanks for taking your time out to answer questions.

     You're welcome, and I've been thinking about that myself. I don't know. I'm going to take a look at the supply boxes and labels this week to see what I might be able to figure out. But my hunch is they aren't going to get much (my guess is none) scrutiny as to whether or not they've come from the originating area of distribution.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If they come in a sequence of +7, I would bet that the other numbers are not legitimate tracking numbers... it's a very crappy "algorithm" so an incorrect tracking number isn't recorded accidentally, I think. I'll play with my scanner sometime this week and see if that's the case. The scanner refuses numbers that aren't "valid", which is based solely on an algorithm like credit cards are. +7 as a pattern wouldn't surprise me.

     no, we deal with millions of international parcels, but there is no procedure domestically to scrutinize anything beyond making sure it has the proper postage (well, there is an anthrax sniffer, and i sure as hell hope you aren't doing that... and media mail, which is often checked to make sure it is actually media... but that's it.)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     once something clears customs and is given to us, it's treated just like anything else. which is to say, it's not scrutinized as long as it's not leaking something.

    What do you mean by "media mail," like a CD or DVD in a bubble envelope?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    when you say "scrutinized," what do you mean exactly? is the package or envelope opened up?
