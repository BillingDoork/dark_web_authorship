    Im guessing your talking about pill popperz. I would rather go with flaxceed, thailand has better chance of packages coming through to the states.

    When you consider the kind of relationship two countries have the implications can be very broad.  When the USA needs to kidnap someone and haul them to a safe place for torture, that safe place happens to be Thailand.  Obviously Thailand does not crank out and import massive quantities of anabolic steroids, benzodiazepines, and post-cycle-therapy drugs to meet local demand.  They know who the biggest consumer nation is for these products.  It wasn't by chance that Viktor Bout was captured in Thailand, and it wasn't by chance that he was extradited to America.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    America could take measures to stop the trade in these compounds if it so chooses.  But you gotta throw your dog a bone sometimes too.  All of the profit from this illicit manufacturing and importing doesn't just end up in some tycoon's pocket.  This is all grease for the wheels that keeps everything running smoothly and doesn't upset the delicate balance- that doesn't strain the friendship.  And remember America has been involved in the drug trade in southeast asia for over 60 years.  It may be hard to fight an unpopular war with taxpayer money, but it's a heck of a lot easier to fight it with heroin profits.  And when you are making money virtually out of thin air, much less explaining needs to be done as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was in a re-shipper's office a few weeks ago and there was an official-looking sign that said "all items shipped to a foreign address require a passport."  I would venture to guess that as long as America needs Thailand as a hedge against Chinese power and as long as Thailand lets planes land there with no flight plan to unload men with black hoods over their heads, nobody is going to ask me for my passport when I mail a parcel.  They just aren't ready to let that grease in the cogs dry up yet.
