    Hey ok so Im worried about a controlled delivery I had something sent from India and it only took 5 days to get to the US It was in and out of customs in a day and a half which is great but,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I track the package on universal tracking it shows me the following line of information as one of the first notifications for the packages movement
    <br/>
    <br/>
    [ADDRESS INFORMATION REMOVED]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if you google that its kind of like UM WHAT THE FUCK SHADY. Also I should mention this is a vendor outside or SR that I have used many times but this is the first time I noticed anything like that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then on top of that it seemed to like package just came to quick. It was out of customs NYC this time yesterday then hit a semi local sort facility this morning and the last update is Depart USPS sort facility with no further updates.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However the package was sent to a mail services business they signed for it sent me a email notifying me of its arrival etc etc So shouldnt the tracking be updated as delivered at this point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im not sure how I feel about it. its about to oz of a schedule 3 but I have gotten much much larger amount than that seized and just gotten a letter so im thinking maybe im just paranoid and that they wouldn't was there time on something small.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had some one unrelated to this situation all together called from a burner phone saying I wont be able to pick it up during the day and if you could leave it out for me to get after hours etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas guys?

    Do you really think India is doing an international case with the US for you?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This paranoia happens when you don't have safe deliveries places and you have to pick it up personally and sign for it. Is up to you to go for it.

    USPS tracking is not updated in real time. If you recieve a Federal Express or DHL package and track it a few minutes later it will show as delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS tracking seems to be updated overnights. So if you view the tracking today you will see it was transited through a facility yesterday, check it tomorrow and you will see it is delievered today.

    Ten years ago before I ever knew anything about SR I ordered some stimulants from India and they got held up at Post Office for sig. I thought nothing of it and went in and signed. I got my package without the clerk even blinking an eye. Don't think I would try it again now but maybe with International packages its common.
