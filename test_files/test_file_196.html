    What are venders using for return addresses? I assume they are fictitious and not a real address of some random person. Is that correct or is it a red flag to have a non existent address on a package?

    If the adress does not add up ( lets say postal code and address) it's a red flag. Best to use someone else's address  from the same city.

    Is there no moral issue with sending a number of packages with a return address that belongs to some random unsuspecting person? Is it possible to use an almost legit address?

    Some real street in some real zip code with a number that does not exist.

    Use a local zipcode lookup to see all the cities are within that zipcode and then just go onto google and type in some sort of business for that city.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like all clothing stores in the city "Whoknowsville" which is within the zipcode you're shipping from, label it exactly as the companies address would be (including name), but change a number in the address so if it is ever return to sender it won't actually reach that clothing store.  Pick any business type, clothing was just first thing that came to mind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USE a business address, NOT an individual's address !

    They have scanners now that read both the "to" and "from" address and match them with real addresses. If no legit house number exists for that return addy, it could be a red flag. Have you ever done postage on the usps website? Enter a return addy or "to" addy thats made up and they will bring it to your attention pronto. At the minimum it could make a clerk look at it more closely.

    I like the apartment idea.  You would be surprised how many people never put their apartment number on their address.  Do that and you have a legit return address but it won't get returned to anyone since the apartment number isn't on there.
