    A while back I received an envelope from out of the country. It arrived with cuts on the sides of it, going up nearly to the top of the envelope, but not enough to allow the contents to fall out. Perhaps enough to allow loose powder to fall out (anthrax?), in the mind of customs. The actual product remained intact and untampered with, however. But should I be worried about this?

    hmm, or someone at the post office, who seemed either suspicious or just plain curious about your package,its good that you received your contents secure though,I would be cautious about ordering from the same country again

    The machines used in the postal system to move and sort envelopes do this to envelopes everyday.  Some get jammed and ripped up and some get cuts/slices.  It's normal and nothing to worry about.

    I've seen those sorts of little rips and cuts in my mail before, but this time it was a pretty clean cut. It makes me think it was deliberate.

    Well if it's not that then I don't really know.  I've never had that problem.  Only from the machines or accidentally damaged parcels.  Was it from NL by chance?
