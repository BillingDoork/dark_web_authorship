    So how do you guys feel about using the USPS shipping address standard:
    <br/>
    JACK MEHOFF
    <br/>
    123 LOVEDRUGS RD
    <br/>
    BLITZED TX 73759
    <br/>
    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
    <br/>
    <br/>
    versus using one like this:
    <br/>
    Jack Mehoff
    <br/>
    123 Lovedrugs Rd.
    <br/>
    Blitzed, TX 73759
    <br/>
    United States of America
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ??? Do you think it even makes a difference?

    I generally don't write it out all in caps like that as most of the packages I've received from SR don't look like 'professional' packages.  More like a package from an online market seller.  A legit one though.. :)

    I am not a vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if I was, I would use all caps for this exact reason.  When businesses send you bills, CC statements, anything official and what comprises what I would guess to be the majority of post, it's in caps or at the very least looks very business like.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't put mine in caps because from browsing vendors and the SR forums I think most vendors do not agree with my stance.  Many specifically ask for no caps.  I don't agree that it looks as inconspicuous but they're the vendor, so I do what they say.  I always read their entire vendor page in addition to the product page and try to follow their directions to the t.  A happy vendor means a happy customer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, (and this is mostly complete guess work), I'd guess most postal workers get tired of reading addresses all day and/or are old and/or have shitty eyesight.  The less effort they use to read my address the faster it's out of their hands.  Caps helps with this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, some people have fucking shitty handwriting.  Caps goes a long way to make things more legible.

    on the usps website, their "proper addressing" is all caps. when you type in an address to get the ZIP+4 code, it'll spit out your address in all caps.

    The most important thing for US Delivery, is the +4 zip code.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course the address formatted correctly using the USPS format as well. Together, there's a good chance the only human to touch it will be your local letter carrier.

    Agreed, i add the +4 every time, its less work for the postal employees to look up your +4 code and add it to the pack. if its already on the label it'll go right through without any additional information needed

    you got zip code and you got ZIP+4 code. its an extended zip code so to speak. not sure if they have ZIP+4 codes for lower population cities, but for larger they are necessary for obvious reasons

    Caps do NOT make things easier to read, they actually make it harder. Depending on the font type, though, it may be easier in some cases, but usually not. Serif's (those little things that come off the letters) on the font are what help make fonts more readable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I worked in a printing studio and had to learn a lot about typography.

    from what i understand they say all cap is easier to read for postal employees because most of them are older than they are younger, which means they may have worse eyesight, nothing to do with proper typography or some shit.

    Any smart vendor will put their addresses according to standard grammatical rules. Any thing else, such as all lower case or all caps is foolish. The number one goal a vendor shrives for is for his/her mail to blend in with the majority of mail, and the majority of shipping labels are capitalized grammatically correct. When I used to get packages from vendors in all caps I would specifically ask that they not be lazy and format it correctly(considering I send it to them correctly all they need to do is copy and paste), or I will stop buying from them. Such poor label techniques raise flags, albiet not big ones, but they do make those peices of mail stand out.
