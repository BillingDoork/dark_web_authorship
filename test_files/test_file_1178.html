    I'm interested in people's experience in ordering/shipping to italy, especially from inside the EU but any information is appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One question I have - would it be better to order from somewhere like Germany than the UK, given that Germany almost has borders with Italy? However, I know German post can be scrutinized more in other countries, so does this still apply for Italy?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have ordered or shipped to italy, what's the average shipping time from within the EU? Any other general advice appreciated.

    I've ordered numerous times from within the EU  and North America.  Never any problems.  I would recommend that you not purchase from a seller within Italy.  It seems to me that the only way LEO's can get your address is to open a sellers account and capture addresses from their own country.

    Italy is notorious for their inefficient mail system. Many times I have been told while in Italy that if I mailed something home to the US, to not be surprised if I was home months before my mailed item showed up. Even possibly it never showing up and when they got to backed up, they would just toss all items and start over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not sure the last part is true, but I do know it was slow as hell to get items I mailed home.

    Thanks. Won't be ordering from the Netherlands or Germany as it turns out as something more appealing has come up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One more question though. Let's say I'm ordering a package from France to Italy (that's not what I'm doing, but let's say it is). When I write the address out with the country at the bottom, should this read 'ITALY' or 'ITALIA' or should it be the french word for Italy?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will the vendor take care of this side of things? I imagine a package having the english word for Italy written on it from a non-english speaking country could lead to it being better scrutinised... What should I do here?

    Yep, it is unorganized and slow, but on the flip side of the coin it is almost impossible that something will get confiscated and totally impossible (it would be more probable that Berlusconi will leave politics) to have a CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing that bothers a little is that sometimes it is all so random. Sometimes you get packages very fast, sometimes they take a lot for almost no motive whatsoever. I guess it is all part of the fun  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I've been in Italy it has always been so. It's all random there. However it happens in very seldom cases that a mail gets missing, no matter the disorganization, and that would be much worse than random delivery times.

    ITALY (all uppercase), it's the best. Use italian names for everything else but the country, that you spell in english.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No matter from what part of the world the letter comes, when it's international the country is usually spelled in english or, at the very least, in the DESTINATION country's language; this is the typical etiquette of shipping letters (that you can find, btw, in sites as RoyalMail or USPS etc.).

    Thanks for the advice everyone, will be placing my order as soon as the coins land in my account. I'm not too worried about it, but is it really impossible for them to do a CD in Italy? Is it just because of lack of funding/much bigger drug networks to focus on, or is there something about Italian law that makes it way less likely than in other countries?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you're right. That's hilarious news.

    It's just that the customs in Italy are really low standard and unprofessional. For what I know they bring dogs etc. just in cases of a tip or if the thing it is really obvious, elsewhere packages pass totally unchecked. To warrant a CD in Italy you should really import some serious bulk and packaged so wrong as that it would have been better to just send the drugs in a transparent plastic bag with a name attached to it (in this last case probably it would still pass  :) ).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I must say that this is a "luck point" for those living in Italy and using SR, but, as it is evidenced above, there's the flip side of totally random shipping  times.

    Good to know. I'm much happier knowing that it might not be there on time with the confidence that there is absolutely no chance of anyone getting in trouble, even though this is a very small order and I have good experience with the vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since joining the road I'm a lot more alert to the possibilities of such things happening, and I tend to read as many horror stories I can find so that I can better negate the chances of it happening to me. If it wasn't for the wonders of Silk Road, I'd miss the old blissfully ignorant days of buying magic truffles from Amsterdam off Clearnet and not giving a shit.
