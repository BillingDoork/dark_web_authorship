    Ordered a half ounce of marijuana and got tracking with it (didn't track on TOR) and it got into my post office about six hours ago. Normally the mail goes "out for delivery" at like 9am but its now almost noon and its still at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It says its scheduled for delivery today, what the fuck? Has this ever happened to anyone and if so, did you end up getting your package?

    I'm assuming your in the US, did you order express delivery?? If so, express goes out with a different mailman than regular mail, so, there's still the possibility that you will get it delivered today......if , in fact, you did order express.

    So... It is still at the post office according to tracking at almost 2pm local time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this just a result of USPS forgetting to update tracking or am I fucked? Anyone who has been in this situation know what I can expect?

    Sometimes, in my experience, the tracking may not update until the post man gets back in from his route.

    I'm sure it will be fine man ;)

    Tracking on a few things of mine(legal stuff) have done this, the tracking will then update at like 6-7pm when the tracking gun gets returned to the post office after the mail person is done with their route.

    Tracking with USPS is horrible.  They're supposedly 'improving' but I've sent hundreds of mails in the last couple years and it's nothing but inaccurate/inconsistent updates.

    first off..
    <br/>
    the courier takes all packages for their address route..
    <br/>
    my mail carrier brings Express, Priority, First Class, etc, etc..
    <br/>
    everything comes with the same courier..
    <br/>
    sometimes different people run the route..
    <br/>
    but that's normal. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    some places do have a 3pm delivery route though..
    <br/>
    where Express or late arrival packages will go out.
    <br/>
    that's always nice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    from what i've come to understand
    <br/>
    is USPS and shit is taking forever right now.
    <br/>
    they could be getting backed up with mail..
    <br/>
    and not to mention people are catching onto the Road..
    <br/>
    like two years ago. ;) and now DPR has done an interview..
    <br/>
    so shit's only gonna get more and more looked into.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if mail couriers notice a routine or a nice looking business..
    <br/>
    they are gonna take it eventually just to see what it is.

    My opinion is that if you ordered from a reputable vendor and they use proper shipping precautions you should have nothing to worry about.
