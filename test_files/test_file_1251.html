    A couple months ago, someone on the forums mentioned that they work for the post office and that every piece of mail was being scanned. The consensus on the thread was that this was likely bs. However the recent news about prisim and other gov't surveillance programs pretty clearly confirms it.

    It seems to be confirmed that the post office scans the front and back of every package. This means that if a package gets popped, they can simply plug the return address into their database and identify every other package that someone used that return address on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think we all kind-of figured that the gov't was tracking lots of data, but knowing this for sure, what changes could be made to lower the risk of this detection method being used against us?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It also seems to me that SR is a pretty low priority per the fact that it is still operating safely. Not that they could bring down the site, but if one day they waged all out war, this is an easy way for them to gain some leverage.
