    I ordered something from NL which was posted to UK last thurs and it still hasn't arrived. I think it usually takes 3-4 days, could it still arrive? Haven't got a customs letter yet.

    Hey Oddworld I think you'll be ok. All my Netherlands 'mail' this year (to NE UK) has arrived and remember some vendors mark items in transit when they haven't yet been posted, depends how well you know you're vendor. I know my guy is really organised and if it says in transit then it's not long off. Some vendors do take a day or two to post.
    <br/>
    Don't worry at this stage ... I reckon give it til the end of this week then if no sign it's likely not coming.
    <br/>
    Hope it arrives :)

    same thing happened to me from the heineken package lost, but another package ordered exactly the same time from another NL vendor arrived 4 days later. i accepted a 50% refund in the end. Hope it got lost in his personal sorting room and not at customs.

    That is a long time man. I've ordered from a few Dutch vendors, and all my packages arrived within 4-5 days of being placed in transit. Hopefully it's just temporarily stuck in the system somewhere, but I'd start preparing yourself for a no-show.

    P.S. Watch out for the Sligs dude!
