    Recently I got arrested on a class 4 felony charge. Right before this happened I ordered a quarter pound of bud to my drop. I am freaking out right now because it is too late to cancel it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My drop is completely 100% clean, but does anyone know of a controlled delivery that's happened with a quarter pound of weed? If I get busted again I am fucked for sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance

    in light of your current situation, I would advise against signing for it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If requires no sig and is just left at your drop, I advise you write return to sender on it, and get it out of your house ASAP.

    alright thanks. this is the first shipment of bud I have ever shipped to this drop. All of the weed cases I have heard about have been at least a pound or more, and happened after a pattern of shipments built up so I was hoping that I would be ok. Thanks though, I will definitely be doing that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone else has heard of a CD on a QP or less please chip in.

    Yea , no prob.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive never actually heard of CDs on that small an amount..Only boxes with like 5 packs or better, and none of them had anything to do with SR. That was all before SR even existed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I where you I wouldnt be worried about the shipment getting scanned, found and CD'd..more so about an open case and whether or not it was drug related bring much more heat on you for anything else drug related.

    Right, yea it was drug related so that's why I am worried. I am out on bail and don't have court for a while, my attorney is confident I can get the charges dropped to a misdemeanor and the felony wiped off my record because of my 100% clean record as long as I don't break probation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    +1 to you, thanks for helping me calm my nerves a bit.

    Hey hellwillbetoasty  yes I agree you should just be ready to get the package AND get it out of there asap, chances are the cops have no idea it's coming, so I think you're good
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's a 'class 4' felony?  Do you mind me asking what you got done with?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alas we aren't in the states so we cant really comment on your law but we have had quite a few deliveries, and have so far never even heard of someone getting a CD
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck with it all mate

    class four felony is the least serious type of felony. got popped for 6 hits of acid. Bail was set at 15,000 (had to put down 10% so 1500)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    to put it into context, there were some guys in jail w/ me that got busted with 2-3 sheets of acid and their bail was set at 100,000, they were being charged with class X felonies which is the worst kind, and were looking at a minimum of 9 years in prison.

    hey toasty very good point you make about the GPS tracker possibilities!

    Personally we'd get rid of all the packaging to a place far away, or at least completely unconnected with yourself!
    <br/>

    Just a thought but something we do with ALL packaging asap

    Going off of the bail they set for you after finding 5 hits of L, I'd imagine wherever you are has fairly strict pot laws. I can tell you where I was last living I had multiple packs seized, each of them more than 3 lbs. In both cases the police did come, but only to ask the houses it was going to if they had any idea about the packages. In neither case were any charges brought up, only a brief questioning. If your seller is at all reasonable with his stealth, this should be no problem. Worst case follow the instructions stated before and refuse to sign, deny knowledge, and if delivered act as if you are "actively" trying to return to sender. Best of luck in your case.

    Just remember, deny deny deny.  Anyone can send ANYTHING to your address.  When you sign for it, you expected it.  Can't do a CD on something you weren't expecting.  If it is dropped off, write "Return to sender" and leave it on your porch a few days.  And if nothing becomes of it, then you're most likely in the clear.  CD's are usually instantly, or minutes after signing for a package.

    the funny part about  writing Return to Sender is about half the letters we get dont  have any 'return address!'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hmmm what could you do in this case?  Maybe write your own!! lol  I mean put the 'return address' on the letter yourself...any addy real or imagined!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AFAIK  they dont leave the drugs in a CD anyway, pretty sure they 'replace' it with something else, and you get busted from 'receiving' the package, not the drugs!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's different around the globe, but we know that down here at least they replace it and the act of accepting the package is considered  sufficient 'evidence'
    <br/>
    <br/>

    A friend who works for Quarantine told me he had his brother send him pot in marker pens, when he was in Japan....says he never had an interception.  One of the main 'problems' with Oz border security is Quarantine.  These guys REALLY WANT TO stop plant and animal diseases coming into the country....which IMO is fair enough, but it's partly that scrutiny that finds our letters too!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oz customs are no better than any first world country like Canada or the US .... however, the Quarantine factor does make us a little worse when it comes to the 'amount' of scrutiny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But IF they were SO great, we wouldn't be here talking about them!  Our guess is they'd be lucky to get even 10% of what comes through!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So Julia's cutting customs funding eh?  I doubt quarantine will be 'cut'  at all, BUT I can see the amount of 'Customs Officers' being reduced.  Honestly they are one of THE most overstaffed public services around!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Coming back from OS late one night there were AT LEAST 10 customs people for one plane...All getting penalty rates... for what?  Some dude who the dog flags as 'dirty' and after 2 hours of searching they 'realize' the dude has nothing .... he'd been somewhere they were smoking dope, before the flight, and the smell was in his clothes! ffs!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bottom line, nothing has really changed, the risks are the same as they used to be, so keep up ya travels on The Road it's all good!

    Hey Motek, thats strange that you get letters with out some sort of return addy on them??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive got well over 50 orders in on SR since ive been here, and not one didnt have some form of return addy.. they usually look bogus, but there always there.

    yes mate we thought so as well!  But what can you do? lol   It didn't seem an issue at the time .... buuut, ....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In fact now I think about it I never mentioned it to the vendor (probably coz we were so happy to get the letters we forgot!?)  Might do that right now in fact
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But return addys are kinda important with a situation like this!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hmmm I wonder what would happen IF there were no return addy on the pack in this situation?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    cheers all

    yea,  on the road everything I've gotten has had a semi legit looking return address, usually to a business but sometimes just a name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However sometimes when i get has oil sent to me in envelopes my friends don't even bother putting a return address,  hasn't ever mattered for something small like an envelope
