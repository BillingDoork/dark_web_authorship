    This is very irritating, and nerve-racking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been on here for quite some time, and mostly used to conduct my business through bitcoin/escrow.
    <br/>
    However, for the last few months, I've been dealing with one vendor specifically, doing a cash-through-mail exchange.
    <br/>
    I know.. I know... the USPS is NOT responsible for any lost, damaged, or stolen packages... so this is risky business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, I always use express-mail. I always evenly distribute my cash into a larger medium (packet of papers, magazine, newspaper, etc), as well as vacc-seal, and wrap with multiple opaque layers. By the time I'm done, it's a very flat package, that one wouldn't ever know the contents of. Nothing is ever packed or stashed near drugs, and gloves are always used... so, I really do not feel that my money was intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I am experiencing the problem stated in the title of this post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As of Tuesday, September the 24th, I have an express-mailer full of cash locked up in status: "Dispatched to Sort Facility" at the origin destination city. It even still says "guaranteed delivery by 12pm Sept. 25th 2012" ...but has not updated once in the past 3 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is anyone else experiencing lock-ups and delays with USPS as of this week?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last week, on the receiving end, my product had been sent to the wrong sorting facility enroute to me, and took an extra 2 days to arrive -priority.
    <br/>
    It also did not update the tracker for nearly 48 hours...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just trying to find some peace of mind... maybe some ideas of what could be up...

    Me and you both buddy, I went on a huge impulse by this weekend. Made like 4 orders 2 of the 4 were sent out monday priority one with tracking and I'm trying to see if the vendor will do me a favor and track it granted its not the 10 day mark. I just want some peace of mind in knowing where everything is, or at least knowing that one package is coming at least and USPS is just slow this week, or could it possibly have something to do with Operation Pangea? I have no clue but maybe others will have a better understanding of this. Sorry to hear your situation bud, but your not the only one. I just want to know if my package got intercepted and now my mailbox is compromised or if its just taking a little longer than usual. Maybe mail is going to be slowed down this week because of that damn Operation Pangea (or whatever its called) Maybe thats whats making mail slow this week. Either way its a little nerve racking.

    Just going by what defines "Operation Pangea" I don't think I have any issues with Interpol, as my package was not containing any illicit materials or drugs, and was not shipped internationally. It is frowned upon, but not illegal to send cash, but no one would ever have known it was cash to begin with, unless some schmuck postal worker snatched it up on a whim because it was heading to Cali?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My guess, and this is me talking my anxiety away here... is that because of some of the impending PO closures and lay-offs that somethings just majorly fucked up right now in their system? It's also the end of their fiscal year in 3 days, and they're about to default on their second deferment of cashed out benefits for their employees --a $5.6 Billion hit for them and the US government.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone else is experience similar circumstances... do say so...

    I'm not the brightest bulb in the box so bear with me here. Ha....What your thinking is maybe because the PO offices are taking such a huge loss and many closing down this week, that that may have a reason with why shipping is taking so long? Because after hearing from a cpl of my vendors there shipping has been slow this week to everyone, I could see how what you said would affect it, I mean take away a big percentage of PO's and there employees its going to become a more drawn out process. I dont know I'm pretty faded right now so if this isnt what your saying and I took it a completely wrong direction please forgive me. I try to do my best on here but there is some things discussed that I cant wrap my 23 yr old brain around. I do my best though~! 8)

    Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. I know a few people who work for the P.O. and they've told me that there is a lingering fear over all of their employees as to who is going to be getting laid off. And, I just read that in the past couple of weeks they've decided to close down about 1/3 of their total operations in the continental United States.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I hope this is the reason for the unexplained delay, and the non-updated tracking information. The recipient hasn't received anything yet, with Track &amp; Confirm indicating that the package is currently stuck in limbo. One would think that if there were any type of seizure of the package, that I would be informed relatively soon of such. But alas, I haven't been informed of anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I take all the necessary precautions to avoid all irregular circumstances, and usually slip through the cracks undetected... however, if there were a seizure, when dealing with cash amounts less than $10,000, a simple claim with proof of income and a viable reason to be sending the cash would be enough to get it back. Though, I'd have to change some policies in my business arrangements thereafter, but nothing I couldn't handle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My hopes are that my hypothesis is not too far off, and that this is all some simple delay and miscommunication within the postal system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Worse case scenario... some fucked up postal worker snatched it. I just don't know why they would... nothing was indicative of cash being contained within, and the package was 100% scent and fingerprint free.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else experiencing this issue? Or have you experienced this in the past and had a positive resolve?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any information is helpful.

    Hey, I'm pretty sure it has been seized by the Feds. I'm in the same situation as you and I was told by the express mail center worker that a note was placed saying it was seized by authorities in suspicion of being a drug proceed. Sucks ass I know..

    I would rather not say which vendor to protect myself and the vendor. I also contacted the post office to see what was up and kept getting bounced around until they finally provided the number to the express mail services center in my local sorting facility, from which I was notified that the package had been seized. Express mail NEVER takes more than 2 days and I speak from my limited experience, but common sense told me that something was wrong right away when it didn't arrive at the destination with 24 hours.

    No. Actually, I've been on here for quite some time, I'm careful as shit.
    <br/>
    I have a computer at one location in which I use for USPS, and related basic browsing and email, different ISP with never having any installs of TOR or anything suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then I have this computer running on Linux, with a flash drive loaded with everything I need, at a second location.
    <br/>
    Neither of these locations receive mail related, nor have associations with names on the return address(es).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My pack was double vacc seealed, flexible, flat, had 5 layers, including carbon-fiber paper and sensitive document foil.
    <br/>
    Printed labels, going to a legitimate company.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm just at a loss... and I don't want to jump the gun with further contact just yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Trust me, I've always preferred escrow... but this guy was on his game, and our business practices have always been top notch on both ends. I'm kicking myself now. Oy.
