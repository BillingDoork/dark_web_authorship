    I ordered an ounce on Thursday night, it was marked "in transit" on Friday. Most people claim this vendor takes 3 days, and thats average time east to west coast for most anyways. Now, mail is still in motion on sundays and federal holidays, its only the carriers who have the day off. This means that it must've been in motion on Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, and today. Thats 5 days and nothing showed up at my door today. I'm a little weirded out, it's my first ever order and seems to be taking a long time. No I did not FE, my money is still in escrow/

    It's USPS, dude. I've had a first class mail status read 'arrival at post office' for a week before it was finally out for delivery. Shit happens, I wouldn't start getting worried for a few more days yet.

    I've experienced the exact same thing lately with priority packs just a state or two away. normally its two days like clockwork but ever since the holidays its been 3 days and one time four and another time 5days from just two states away, the only guarantee is express but its a higher profile and not as camouflaged as priority so its normal we're all experiencing delays right now just sucks i know!

    I saw on good old fox news the other night that the USPS was going to be broke by October of this year unless they did some major cost cutting.   I think Saturday delivery or a big up in the prices is in the near future.   Hopefully but doubtfully it will help packages arrive more often.

    Yes, USPS may be slow because of the holiday but one week?  I ask all vendors to not mark "in transit" unless it actually is in the PO hands.  For me personally if ask for priority or express shipping it's because I need it ASAP or I would just use first class and save myself the money.  Customer service is a two-way street and I feel if I speak up I will piss off my vendors.  I don't want that either.  Just some consideration.

    That's the policy I have MaRy... Orders are never confirmed until they are posted and meandering thru the postal system.

    I'm dealing with a fk nut vendor who never has communicated and wont respond to nice message. Its been 9 days domestic now. Can't wait to resolve this one way or another so I can move on to a good vendor. Don't put up with that shit service and don't give the vendor repeat business no matter what the price or quality is I say.

    amen shit communication and service is my pet peave, if i'm going to buy something from you and you take forever to communicate or ship don't bitch if people take their time finalizing, We both owe one another prompt and clearly communicated service and expectations and nothing is more maddening than vendors who don't care to take care of customers, on the same note i can understand how great vendors are maddened by shitty customers who don't finalize when the vendor shipped you a good product in good time.
