    Hey everybody, I'm a long time buyer &amp; I've had an usually large amount of packages from Europe not make it into Australia. This failure rate is a lot higher than normal. I'm hoping it's because of postal delays and not customs flagging them at the local post office. Could the Olympics be a contributing factor?

    Aus customs are shit, they've seized no more lately than they ever have. All those media reports are fear mongering trying to deter people, they are fight a war they are getting they're ass kicked in.

    Day 21 of waiting for me... I ordered 10 grams of coke from NL to Canada, and still nothing in the mail. :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have NEVER experienced delays like this.. This is also the first order from NL that has never made it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I check the mail every day, and every day I don't receive I feel more and more that it will never arrive.. at this point I assume the worst..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe they are finally cracking down and intercepting more mail these days?...

    There is quite  few threads with this topic going about.. but alot of people experiencing large delays everywhere (and not just to Australia)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just can't see one massive interception.. I have heard stories of legitimate mail also being very late. I have had 100% success so far... so am really surprised at the number of packages reported to go missing at the same time.
