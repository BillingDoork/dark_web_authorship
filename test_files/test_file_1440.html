    Hey guys, I've been ordering a few bulk packages from EU lately.. even though I hate ordering international but I can't afford to pay 2-3x the price for MDMA locally(CAN)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    been having some packages taking longer than expected, they've been shipped 'no signature required' but the same vendor also offers shipping with tracking(Signature required) for me it would be alot easier on the mind for me to be able to track the package to me, and I don't use a fake name when ordering so I'm just wondering what you guys think about this? is it worth it to take Shipping with tracking if it requires me to sign for the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks alot for your help ! cheers guys

    Normally I would say signing for things isn't worth it for tracking but with my experience ordering from the EU (I also live in Canada) I can say that I would almost rather sign for my packages then have to blindly wait for them. If it makes you feel any better, I have had 2 orders from the EU, one took about 20 business days and the other has yet to arrive and it has been about 22 business days. However, every other purchase I have made has made it quite promptly (A week at most). The fact that one of them has shown up, leads me to believe the shipping times from certain parts of EU to certain parts of Canada is just really, really slow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just what I think, anyone else from Canada with experience ordering from EU please share what you think as well as I'm still fairly new to it.

    There seems to be widespread disagreement on this issue.

    Depends entirely on the vendors stealth. Some stealth I have seen is so over the top that I would trust signing for it in the prescense of 10 police dogs and customs agents.

    I 3rd this!!! Stealth is the most important factor when buyin in bulk...even more important than the price itself!!! There are vendors that sell keys $500-600+ cheaper but their stealth will send you straight to the pen...no questions. I sign for all of my packages with no hesitation because my vendor is TOP NOTCH when it comes to it
