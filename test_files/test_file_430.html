    Okay so I have a very simple question to ask that I haven't found a very clear answer on. If they find your package in the mail and say its 7 grams of high grade cocaine what will happen? Just come to my door and ask me to sign for it? And if I don't just leave me alone? I know as soon as a package is shipped across state lines it is no longer a state issue. You now are facing federal charges. I think any time you are using the mail to ship these things you are facing federal charges. So I find it hard to believe they will just come to your door and ask you to sign for something and if you don't then its all over.

    I cant say for sure but I do believe you are right for being suspicious that they may do more than just send you a letter in the mail. People obviously get busted, and few if any come back to tell about it. Either because they are in prison or because they believe it is in their best interest to never return.
    <br/>
    Police, even feds, have been known to bend the rules as they see fit so you are right to be worried but combat that worrisome with extra caution. And make sure you have an attorney to call.

    First off unless you have had your MAIL sent EXPRESS and the vendor did not waive the SIG then you dont sign for anything!! All mail except EXPRESS mail is just left in your box, express can be to and usually is just the vendor has to make sure the signature has been waived .. If the mail man comes knocking at your door then you may have a issue unless you know your signing in advanced dont really worry about it... There is plenty of threads of SECURITY ETC on this forum its Sticky'd at the top READ IT!

    Yep, never sign if the vendor does not require it,  vendors know if its been delivered or not anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they do find medicine in your package, you basically say "I've had a girl staying with me for awhile, so she must have used my name and address..for i know nothing about this...?"

    <br/>
    This has been discussed to DEATH on the forums, go away and do some reading, and for the love of god do not pay too much attention to some of the replies on this thread, using your neighbors address is not cool man, putting someone else in the frame for your drug order is just asking for trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do not sign for anything if you haven't asked for signature required, sort out a drop not linked to you, it's not that hard if you put the effort in and if LE do come knocking do not say anything without your lawyer present, making up stories re ex tenants only puts you in the frame, the only thing you should say is I have no knowledge of anything you are talking about and leave it at that, the burden of proof resides with the police, do not do their job for them.

    my advice is to leave out the part about someone staying with you, that involves a name le will want, and will add more lies to your tale. just stick to the you don't know anything, and lawyer up. But chances are in your favor the mail will come through fine. Good Luck

    I had an express shipment from Cali overnight, came the next day before 12pm, mailman rang doorbell 3x then I opened the door to accept package, left it for a while not to open it.
    <br/>
    After he left, few hours later, I opened it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact that the mailman came knocking on my door be an issue? Doesn't seem like that to me, maybe just to alert the household theres a package?.. no signature obviously.
