    So, I am just wondering on my next step...would it be resolution or thats it, I have to cut my losses?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My order shipped last Monday(8/20) and it supposedly was delivered the following Monday(8/27) (a week, which was longer than it was expected). I asked for the DCN too late(8/29) just being patient to not flood the seller with questions and did not know it was labeled "Delivered" as of that Monday. I never got the package. I can only speculate so much into when/where/how/what, but I just know I didn't get it. No fake name/fake address, all legit as i've had one order before this and it came no problems within about 3 days.
    <br/>
    I have no idea what happened this time....but as I see it, I think im about to lose because it was marked as "Delivered". The only piece of defense I feel I have is, during the journey the package was 1. processed/sorted through a nearby city facility, then 2. marked as "Missent" and then 3. it was again processed/sorted and followed onward to its "delivered" state later on in the tracking. And it definitely took a week to make it to wherever it is now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have about a day or so before the resolve is available, or will I probably lose in this case anyway?

    The evidence is in the favour of the seller, unless he has been defrauding people lately. Always try to resolve issues by opening  dialogue with the vendor to see if you can work something out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This sounds like a case of someone stealing your mail or delivering it to a wrong address (mis-sorting is common among some incompetent postal workers, though less likely with larger packages). If this is the case, you shouldn't really expect anything from the seller, but they may have high enough profit margins to reship some or all of the order if you're a reputable buyer.

    Yes, what Regicide says.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of scam buyers out there and sellers may discount your story and label you as another scammer.  Plus the buyer likely did not scam, so it isn't his/her fault either.  You could ask for 50%, but I wouldn't lose my cool.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I lost $190 on one order a few months back (I FE'ed like a newbie dummy).  Since then, I make smaller orders to limit my exposure.  I'm 15/16 in delivery.  You just have to accept that there will be the occasional loss.  I love SR!!!!

    Oh well...so, I should finalize and in feedback say I never got it, but it wasn't the sellers fault? What feedback score would that be?

    Good question.  First ask if the vendor will refund you 50%.  You might get smacked down, but it's worth an ask.  If vendor is an ass, I would leave a 2 or a 3.  If he is a cool but says no, a 4 (with explanation of what happened in review).  If he refunds any or all, you have to give a 5 and praise him in your review.  If you get any refund at all, I would be a customer for life as this vendor when above and beyond to provide excellent customer service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else want to chime in on scoring the vendor in review?  This one seems tricky and I don't totally trust my judgement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going to give you a +1 Karma, Majinx.  Just because you seems like you need a lift in spirits and you have been VERY sane about your non-delivery.  Most freak out and call scam.  Plus I just got my 100th post (required to give karma) and I'm itching to try it out!!!

    The appropriate feedback score is a very tricky question for sure. anything below 5/5 is considered "negative" which is essentially flawed, because sometimes we have small issues that we feel don't deserve 5/5 but maybe a 4/5 if the packaging was bad but arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In this case you have to use your judgement as to whether or not the vendor did his "due diligence" and shipped the product well packaged, and the package was not stolen because of poor packaging revealing its contents. If you feel the vendor did everything in his/her control to send the package then nothing below 5/5 is deserved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like Hamb said tho, if the vendor is a dick and accuses you of scamming when you're not, then a lesser score is appropriate. A truthful explaination of the occurance is always a good idea even if you get refudned. For example, if you write something like "Initial order was marketed 'delivered' but I did not personally receive it and it was likely not the fault of the seller. 50% refunded." This does not look negative to the buyer unless there are several people with the exact same issue, then perhaps it is the seller defrauding people or poorly packaging items.

    i've had random delays (postmark confirm when it was sent) inter europe before, asked for an extension and was sure it had been lost but turned up just before the extension ran out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I'd ask for a 5-7 day extension in the resolution center it shows good will to the vendor and theres a chance it's just got stuck somewhere

    Well, im about to have an assault/battery charge. Someone stole the package, and I am waiting to catch him back home.........Now what feedback do I give, as I may never know if the packaging was good/bad and if the product was as pictured. All my feedback can reflect is, He did ship, it took a week, it did arrive, so he's a legit seller.

    As you pound the person who stole your stuff senseless ask him if it was worth it. Then leave answer in feedback.
