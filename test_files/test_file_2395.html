    I'm Australian....
    <br/>
    Can someone tell me... I had a couple of orders international come through(HARD DRUGS) and many, many letters/packages of research chemicals(100%) get to me...  My question, is "stealth" packaging simply a letter that looks like a letter, ie: reasonably flat, reasonably evenly weighted, vac sealed(smell proof), and (from what i have seen) just sticky taped to a piece of paper folded in more paper?  Maybe some cardboard or something?
    <br/>
    I really want to know.
    <br/>
    I suppose i'll see dr. mdvp's style within a week or so.. but so far 'stealth' doesn't live up to it's name.  CW's and VMM's weren't amazing.. in fact exactly what I just stated.  All Rc's come like that.  THIS IS NO SECRET.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks
    <br/>
    Stay safe

    No, true stealth packaging is just that.  An example I'll use is about 5 years ago, I ordered some methylphenidate off a dodgy online pharmacy. My package came from Philippines and instead of 25 pills, I got a keychain with a small hand-crafted "souvenir" sandal on it. After tearing apart the sandal, I found my pills within.

    There are some vendors here who have similar methods - won't go into specifics. But the best stealth shippers make their products look like something else, enough to get by casual inspection and fool overworked postal inspectors in all parts of the planet.

    Hi Flashblock,
    <br/>
    We're an American vendor who only vend to domestic buyers, so take what we have to say with a grain of salt as international orders are likely something different. But 'stealth' seems to be a relative term around here. With the exception of a few vendors, 'stealth' also seems to imply simply that the package/letter just 'fits in' with the rest of the mail being run through the system, rather than have anything to do with the ability to hide the contents of said package should it be opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before becoming a vendor we received many packages with, what we considered, bullshit packaging; as you put it, just some drugs taped to a piece of folded up cardboard and stuffed in an envelope. Thing is, providing ACTUAL stealth, is expensive. We deal in MDMA, so I'm going to use that as an example... to effectively hide 10 capsules of MDMA — to the tune that if you opened the package you would be hard pressed to actually find the drugs — would likely cost $30+ per package. Some people would pay this, sure. But, given the rules of the mail system (at least over here), it's easy enough to just say 'it wasn't me.'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All that said, this very conversation is one our team had prior to becoming a vendor ourselves. Because of said conversation, we take pride in knowing that our packaging is well above 'par'. Not only does our package tend to 'fit in' with other mail, but once opened it isn't immediately evident that it contains an illicit substance either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To each their own.

    Well said. I would have to say this isn't the 'norm' here, though. At least not with the majority of MDMA vendors. Also, it's worth noting that I've only worked with high volume vendors; packing like this takes significantly more time and to some vendors that would drastically effect their workflow. It's probably looked at more along the lines of "what percentage of my packages are arriving to their destination?" If the answer is above a certain threshold, it's 'good enough.'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree that there are a few (in our experience) who go above and beyond. That is the beauty of being a buyer, though. Should you not like the way one vendor packages, you have the ability to find someone else who hopefully meets your standards. There is plenty of variety.
