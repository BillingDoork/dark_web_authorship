    Hey i was wondering if anyone's been in this situation before and can share some insight. I recently ordered some weed that was a no-show. The vendor said some orders may have been intercepted and that addresses may be flagged. Well before i even though any of this was going to happen I had ordered 2 small orders and I won a G of MDMA from CAN. Now im wondering if these will show? I cleaned my house out already and know to not sign anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone had a no-show and then still recieve other things that were sent? (This is all US domestic btw)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: come on, 30 view no responses? If you have any insight or thought at all about my situation feel free to post.

    Just my opinion but I think you would be okay.  Even if the package from vendor A got flagged.  Packages B and C are not likely to go through the exact same processing center.  And I don't see the system being able to "flag" your name and address nationwide immediately.

    That sucks, sorry to hear about your situation.
    <br/>
    I've had a no show before (different reason from the vendor though) and was worried about my address.
    <br/>
    However, due to the fact that it wasn't possibly flagged, I knew that I could continue to get packages at that address (and have gotten them all).
    <br/>
    I would say as soon as these two in-transit orders arrive, change the address.
    <br/>
    Keep your house clean, don't sign, change your patterns, etc.
    <br/>
    You know the drill.
    <br/>
    It'll be ok. :)

    Cool thanks. Ill be sure to update what happens over the next few days. I probably have another drop I can use. One of my orders is just blotters and it's under a different name than the others. I may stick to using my other name that I can use for things that can fit in standard envelopes and use my other addy for weed and other large things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone know what items other than blotter is sent in envelopes? I know I've gotten mxe before. Vac sealed to very stealthy. Know about MDMA?

    You may as well get tracking with domestic since theres not much risk?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How is the vendors rating and reputation? Maybe it was never sent at all
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I highly doubt they are going to be kicking in your door for 1 or 2 grams here.
    <br/>
    Not cost effective for them

    It was half an o and some wax. I still have a g of MDMA nondomestic coming too. I got a full refund plus and extra 5$ so I'm pretty sure It was actually sent/possibly intercepted. I'm not too worried about any busts or anything like that but I want to know if my other things will still come. This was the first time I've ever not received.

    Perhaps not paranoia...If that first pack got intercepted, I'd still change my address and such. Honestly, paranoid (in a healthy, cautious way) people are less likely to make a mistake and get caught, just my .02 btc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless, glad they both showed up, op!!
