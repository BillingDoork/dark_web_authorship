    I am a new buyer, managed to get a few BTC and am now looking at placing my first order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a think i've noticed is that all sellers require early finalisation from new buyers, and not only. On a personal level, I full understand whay they do it. But isn't this contrary to SR rules? I read in the Buyer's Guide on the wiki: "on't expect much sympathy if you finalized  early".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What am I to do? Should I just go ahead and place my order from a vendor with good feedbacks and FE and keep my fingers crossed hoping for the best? It seems like this is the only option.

    most vendors require people with under 5 transactions to finalize early.  sucks, but its part of the initiation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what do you want to buy?  we can help you find a vendor that won't rip you off.

    Do you think it's a good choice of both product and vendor? Also considering it would have to be shipped from US to UK.

    There are plenty of vendors that don't require it, just look around. Rocker, No FE Ever, I saw a few H vendors that don't require it, a lot of weed vendors don't because there is so many of them that's just one small thing they can do to get more buyers. Just look around  :)

    sorry i don't know much about the heroin scene here, but that listing seems fine to me for a first timer.  its wise of you to choose a small amount for your first buy.  he's a new vendor, but seems legit at first glance.  search his vendor name on the forum and see what kind of feedback people are giving him.  unless there are big red flags i'd say go for it....you don't have much to lose on that one.

    Eh, most vendors can see that you've made five purchases that come out to less than .1btc and know you did that just to try and slip by their FE requirement for new buyers. A lot of vendors will just refuse to sell to you from then on if you try to trick them. There are plenty of vendors who don't require it, you can either buy a few times from them or risk FE with small amounts until you've made a few purchases.
