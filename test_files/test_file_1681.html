    What generally happens?
    <br/>
    I warned buyer that the name used was sketchy (initials) and that  I was not going to cover refund if there was an issue.
    <br/>
    I'm not worried about the contents, but the return addy is a legit company. Problem is I used several legit companies.
    <br/>
    If it is returned, I am unsure what they will do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I have to completely change all my return addys and shipping method which was PERFECT. I should have declined delivery, but buyer assured me he had gotten several orders with just initials.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone run into this situation?
    <br/>
    Can buyer try and have the dcn redeilivered?

    Damn that really sucks. I dont use companies or pre-print labels in the event something like this happens.  then again i guess your method all depends on how frequently you have to do drops.  you definitely should have refused it no matter what they said, sorry.  sorry if I  come across as a dick, but seriously, that irritates me that they would be so stupid as to use initials.  Like a simple misspelling wouldn't give them the same amount of plausible denial ability and put you as the vendor at much less risk.  Can you pm me the buyer please?  I wanna make sure I never do buis with them.  I actually made a similar mistake and did an initial shipment but initial only for the first name.

    As for the DCN, yeah they can try to have it delivered...you should do everything you can to convince them to call from a payphone and get that shit delivered.  trust me, when that company mailroom gets it, depending on who works their mailroom, when they open it to see what happened (they will be suspect of the labeling and stamps in the first place)...they are certain to call the authorities.  Remind the buyer of this....the only thing (aside from DNA that you dont have to really worry about if it was anything small and you were careful) that is comprimised....is that buyer's security in the longrun.  if he's lucky they company mailroom guy likes whatever he finds and mums the word....if not... D.B  (douchebag's initials) and address are the first place Im guessing the state police station contacts  (the police  in DB's town) saying what they found.

    Hell yes never use initials. Do buyers think that's gonna save their ass is they get busted? Pathetic. My general rule of thumb is if don't feel right about something then you cancel the order. Plain and simple.
