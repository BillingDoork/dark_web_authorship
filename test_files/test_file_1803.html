    there's a UPS store very close to me and I was thinking about getting a mailbox there.  Anyone have any experience?  would you recommend, or advise against?

    I went into my local UPS store and asked some questions about it. The nice lady said that before I could rent a box she would need to photocopy my government-issued ID and send it to the postal service for verification. So, not very anonymous, and depending upon what "verification" mean, it could be that using false ID would sound an alarm. Also, it was pretty expensive.

    You're better off buying a fake insurance card since it doesn't require a photo and you can buy USPS boxes with it.

    UPS store opperates under USPS program: "CMRA." They should not get approval from post office but they are to copy the identity document and keep a log of the customers and log alone should be submitted to post office on a schedule. Post office may or may not be strict about the log requirement but I suggest not to deal with UPS, find other CMRA faclity instead.

    They asked my mule for 2 photo id's but there was no waiting process. Gave her a key right away and a key to the store for after hour pick ups. A couple of my stores actually sign for me and leave it in the box.   You can let it sit there for a couple days and wait to pick it up when no one is there just check the parking lot a couple hours before you plan to collect. Negative - would be there is no plausible denibility when you show up at 4 am if the cop r waiting...but if you let the package cool off for a week they aren't going to wait forever ( I hope)

    Some stores and online registration for PO boxes requires two forms of ID, one with a photo, one without, however, some stores will accept just the second form of ID, which can be an insurance card. You could buy a full set of fake information, but I prefer to not have my picture associated with it. I rented my local one for a year with just an insurance card that I bought on here.
