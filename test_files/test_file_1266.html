    I order tons of shit, and have for many many years. Nothing illegal just lots and lots and lots of shit. Ive only had 3 "alternative" pieces of mail this year sent to me out of probably 50+ shipments total. no problems at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I had an order recently placed from a reputable seller with many orders/feedback (i only order domestic) and 100% feedback. He swears it was sent out to me but it simply never arrived, it was over two weeks and it should have taken 3 days, he processed a refund and I figured he was just "playin" me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well so I place another similar order from another even Much higher rated 100% FB top tier seller that says he shipped it priority a week ago. Ive already gotten all my orders priority from two days ago but his never came. The strange part about this order is the guy doesn't know if he sent it or not but marked it as "shipped" the day after I placed the order. He just tells me that he thinks he would have sent it but would need to "check his slips", for three days hes been saying he will "check his slips" then today finally says he cant check them cause they are in an alternate location. He says he sent out like 20 orders that day but my order info didnt ring any bells... strange thing is this guy has a perfect FB track record with hundreds of orders??? So im thinking this guy was either too damn high to recall if he ever got his orders right or he is just as puzzled as I am as to why it never arrived...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really dont see how I could have compromised my address being that Ive only had 3 "bad" orders ever sent here that all arrived. Besides the items ordered were not as bad as a normal"illegal drug" someone might receive, and I would be able to play it off as just my normal medication...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas guys? Im not sure at this point if I am comfortable placing any more orders but I don't want to get paranoid of a couple little pills either...

    Bro it cleaarly sounds like the vendor is fucking around..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They send priority for a reason, mostly for FAST SHIPPING AND MAINLY cause it has tracking, so they can prove if they go to reso they sent it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A vendor that has lost the tracking? knowing that is one and only thing that will prove he sent a order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think its the vendors bro.. Iv got 50+ order from here.. I also am lke u and for years have always had tons of legal stuff i order online ,big packages, little packages etc//
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just know this//
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF SOMEONE COMES TO THAT DOOR, WNTING S SIG, AND U KNOW U HAVE NOTHING COMING NEEDING IT, REFUSE IT, SAY I HAVE HAD SOME WR0NG MAIL COME LATELY AND I DONT RECOGNIZE THAT NAME OR ADDRESS...

    is it just me or are there a LOT of people missing orders within the Eu recently? just clikc the shipping tab on the forums and look at the first 2 pages, There are threads after threads of people who have been great buyers with no previous problems getting fucked recently. No idea why this is happening but a lot of packages seem "not to be arriving lately". i have one sample order not arrived, with no customs letter or knock on the door, (doubt there would be for a sample) im seriously starting to wonder what's going on in general.

    Hi SR´s!!
    <br/>
    I think it´s very good if everybody writes about not arrived, orders - even dom!
    <br/>
    Maybe we can verify some change, which would be even interesting for the vendors.
    <br/>
    I am, for instance, missing also 2 orders, but they´re from so called "red flagged" countries.
    <br/>
    I received about 20+ orders the last 3 months, and each one arrived.
    <br/>
    But since 2-3 weeks nothing is working as usual.
    <br/>
    It started with long-time delivering (instead of 3 days 10-12 days) and ended now with no show of 2-3 orders.
    <br/>
    I already wrote a thread about this circumstances, and the more I read about this, the more I get the feeling that there has changed something at the post or customs.
    <br/>
    I wouldn´t wonder about this.
    <br/>
    There could be the possibility,that they keep the "red flagged"-pieces a few days longer, so the dog could do his work much easier, cause after some time every material let diffund sth from inside. (and the dog has to come only once a week or so)
    <br/>
    Maybe there were some different seized letters which where shown to the postal workers to recognize them as such ones?
    <br/>
    So if some letters come through customs, at least the postal worker at the local office could stop them!?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree, there is something going on with the post-service in EU!!!... but what???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I started now ordering some usual things from that countries, so I can compare about delivering time, etc...

    I had a friend who went to the military and stayed 10 years, a sort of semi-career, afterwards he got a degree in Criminal Justice, then law school, but he didn't finish law school.  He got a job with Customs/INS and, though he didn't work at a hub, he did visit several and me and him go way way back.  Bottom line, he had a good sized trust fund and he retired at the ripe old age of 42 er 43, right around there (lucky bastard).  We smoke and do all kinds of drugs now.  He orders them to his own house, in his own name.  He has gotten several LL in just the past few years because he does mass orders for others.  Keep in mind he is not a street dealer, he usually gets his cheap, splits into two or three orders and only sells to dealers whom he trusts, one LL was for an order of 500 Parke Davis 1mg Xanax, in the foil from Pakistan.  He scanned the LL and they sent a new one that got through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know he doesn't want to get convicted of a felony and lose his pensions.  He says there is no list.  He compared it to a small town store where someone passes off a bad check.  They post a picture to shame the person to coming in and paying by putting their picture up, like and 8x10 and say "DO NOT TAKE CHECKS FROM THIS WOMAN, SHE HAS SEVERAL FELONY CONVICTIONS AND IF YOU KNOW OR SEE HER TELL HER TO TAKE CARE OF THIS BAD CHECK OR SHE WILL GET PICKED UP FOR ANOTHER ONE".  He said, now imagine the busiest, biggest store in a given city.  They couldn't do that for everyone who shoplifted or  wrote a bad check.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He said Customs is the same way.  They want to stop a bomb.   If you are on a terrorist watchlist, don't order any bombs via USPS, otherwise they have NO database and he said that after the 30 days to claim you stuff is up, they incinerate it, along with the letter, which is not stored, Just a standard form where some guys puts in your addy and it prints it on a letter along with what they found, example: Envelope containing diazapam, puts the danger to order from overseas, the letter that tells you that you may come to court and challenge it (aka Judge orders you to be placed in custody and charged with trafficking).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He says take the package, mention that you were not expecting anything but family is always sending stuff from Amazon and ebay, say, I wasn't expecting this, just leave it on the porch and I will take it back to the PO if it's a wrong address to be sent back to the return address, or if I find out some had me a gift sent from (State, City, Business Name, whatever, I will take it).  Quickly dial up mom and ask if her, dad, or anyone else may have sent a gift, though he knows what it is, he is laying on a thick defense and though this has never happened, he has a lot of plausible denial, wiggle room and I don't even think he could be arrested.  If you are super-paranoid, like me, waste and envelope, a stamp and a small amount of time writing a letter to the return address, sealed and stamped, explaining how you haven't even heard of their company, much less done business with them.  TAPE IT TO THE BOX-THE SHARPIE IS YOUR FRIEND
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck to all

    I too have not received a package that should have come by now. It was US domestic and only half a gram of coke, but I'm kind of bugging since it's the first time it's happened in 8 orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You guys think it's cool to use this address again? Assuming the vendor sent it of course.

    I'm 8 business days in waiting on a small, lettermail domestic order in Canada. I'm surprised to see how often this seems to happen to people.
