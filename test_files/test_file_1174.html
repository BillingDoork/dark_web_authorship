    So I've noticed all of my packages (even other stuff like Ebay/Amazon/etc.) always has a pink dot smeared on the package always. I've never noticed any color before so I'm guessing pink is what the USPS uses to identify mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's the purpose? I know vendors and Amazon &amp; Co. aren't putting the dots there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any insight from a postal worker possibly? I know I'm not the only person either since many of my friends have had this happen recently.

    It's obviously LE coming to get ya and your friends, run, run now!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously though, are you all getting these "marked" packages from the same post office?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At my post office they write house numbers, sometimes whole addresses in big black marker on the box or envelope to make it easier.  Could it be your post office is just marking packages like that as they process them?  I imagine every post office is a little different but I love playing the paranoia game, its fun.

    I'm not worried in the least bit that it's anything LE related. I'm just curious as to what the pink dot smeared on the package is meant to represent to the USPS processing system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean it could definitely be the mailman dotting his packages so he remembers which ones are his/etc. I don't know.

    Same thing today, except it seems someone tried to peek in a package through a corner slit. Going to confront the mailman directly since this mail is completely legitimate (video cards/PC parts/etc.)

    Since you are someone who DOES receive illegitimate mail, I would recommend against "confronting" your postal carrier over opened mail. AFAIK, your postal carrier has absolutely nothing to do with mail security. If you confront him over that (mail gets inspected all of the time), it may just cause you to be more suspicious and possibly get your address flagged. This is all conjecture, but it seems plausible to me. I've always taken the stance to try to blend in as much as possible when breaking the law.

    yea i once noticed that on a letter i got from europe to usa. the letter had green dots on the top right corner on BOTH sides of the envelope.
    <br/>
    Envelope was completely empty and missing the drugs. Vendor told me he probably forgot to include the "goodies" in the letter and reshipped and the reship arrived fine. Could be just a coincidence but i always wondered..

    That is an issue with the sorting machine. I would let the mailman know that there is an issue and it is damaging the mail.

    I too just noticed this on a package I received.  It was my new mouse pad I ordered off of amazon and it had a red dot on the package.  It also had a yellow highlighted straight line on it as well.  What does it mean?  Does red dot equate to red flag?  Is it safe?

    Just curious what difference telling the mailman will make.  USPS depends on their giant fast-moving sorting machines to efficiently sort mail and I doubt the mailman has much (any) influence over that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to avoid the mail sorting machines then sent packages instead of flat letters.  However, I suppose flat letters sorted by machines are less likely to be noticed as long as they are secure.

    I frequently recycle USPS boxes, including those from the Road. They get lost in our corporate office, and back into the USPS network. The previous tracking label is carefully removed, and I usually throw on a few pieces of tape to preserve the boxes' longevity. So, at least the screen is working in favor of counter-tracking.

    Sometimes codes can be hidden with nearly invisibile yellow dots, get a blue monochromatic light and they will stand out as black dots.
