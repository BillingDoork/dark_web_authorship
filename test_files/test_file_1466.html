    Hey all
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So a quick question for anyone out there that has had stuff posted to Australia from overseas (import)
    <br/>
    with a non real name on the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can we get mail from overseas with a fake name on it?
    <br/>
    Or does it get picked up because that person it not registered at that address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally think you can but want to hear if anyone has done this and had success or not?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hey all i posted this in the newbie discussion but now i have moved out of the newbie discussion area i thought i would see if i could get some more responses to my question. Here's a link to the original thread for reference.

    Where I live, the posties tend to be "regulars", and as such, they usually know who lives where and which names belong to which addresses. And one would assume, which don't.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And in many apartment buildings, especially big and/or upmarket ones, posties often drop off a bundle of mail which then gets sorted by a concierge or caretaker.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is probably no significant risk in using a fake name, so long as it doesn't scream "pseudonym".
    <br/>
    So many people nowadays live with flatmates/significant others, etc., it probably wouldn't draw any attention.
    <br/>
    I would be discreet and suss out the area first. I doubt that Australia Post has the resources to do higher-level monitoring of names and addresses, especially if you live in a city.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Watch out for the Electoral Commission though, they find you anywhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then again, someone I know uses mail redirection with a fake name - they put in a form at the Post Office under the name in question saying they moved from a share house or something - and apparently it works. Their SR mail gets to their real address under a fake name.

    A quick search of the forums would reveal this issue has been discussed extensively already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Names and addresses are not linked in Australia so use whatever name you like provided it looks legit. The only exception to this would be if you live in some regional location location where the postie knows you by name and might get suss at a sudden influx of O/S mail not addressed to you.
