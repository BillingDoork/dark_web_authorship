    Hello to all
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a question to all buyers who bought from Germany !!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you also have BIG DELAYS on your order ?? I bought some good on the 15.07 from an German seller and i finalized early at the 18.07 and i am waiting and waiting and waiting…
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes to all who say DONT FE i have done this because I DONT WANT TO SIGN FOR SUCH GOODS…
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could not be that the post needs 12 days to send to an neightboring country !!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From an other german seller i ordered on 22.07, and it arrived 26.07… (4days)
    <br/>
    How could it bet hat two orders from same country to same country takes such different time ??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else waiting on Orders from Germany ?? If yes how long do you wait ??
    <br/>

    maybe the rest of the world's customs put pressure on Germany to profile certain pieces of mail ... The big vendors mail... and is blocking them before they even exit the country?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yeah, scratch Germany. errr. now... Spain?

    I have seen on multiple threads that there are currently delays re: German shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, apparently, there was a German postal worker's strike which i'm sure would have affected the shipping times. And with the Olympics on, all major EU mail hubs would be under more pressure than usual.

    I also have an order from Germany which at this point I am doubting I will receive.
    <br/>
    Please don't flame me for this, but my personal opinion is leaning towards German customs were probably pressured by international customs agencies to show some results due to the success of German vendors.

    Still, can't help but imagine the happiness I will feel if it does comes through.

    No one will flame you, and I think its a very legitimate answer. You can read up on their findings/data on the Zoll website.

     Man, really hard to gauge what is going on as we are a global community... I am outside of the EU, previous orders from DE came between 7-10 days. Pending packages are now at 18 days and counting, from a reputable vendor. Olympics etc aside, its hard to understand why there can be such a fluctuation in delivery times to developed countries. IF any of the conspiracy theories are true, then i guess all "non SR" mail would also be held up... which i imagine is 99.999% of mail received from DE to any country! If this is to be case, then how long can they afford to piss off their customers? Also, i dont imagine that the DE government would take orders from any country ... i reckon history proves me right  ;) All i can say is .. whatever the reason for the delays, irritating as it may be.. i stand firm in my right to do experience my life the way i want to.

    No delay for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    48 hours door to door. Ordered Monday, enjoying right now. Same delivery time for my package I ordered from NL on Monday; 48 hours door to door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Probably either the vendor, or the country the package is handed off to. Won't ask you which country, but curious of the vendor
