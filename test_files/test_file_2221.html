    Would it be unwise to purchase one of those battery powered vac pusher sealers instead of a large unit?  Purpose being for up to 100g of powder USA.  Since the powder does not smell, but is detectable by K9, shouldn't the FoodSaver unit be effective alone?

    That's exactly what I thought.  I'm looking at all these 150+ USD sealers and all I ask is, does it really mask the smell that much longer?
    <br/>
    For example the anise smell of MDMA, sealed through a vacuum seal put in a solid container in a flat rate box shouldn't be a problem whether I sealed it with the Pump n Seal or the Omnitrix 69.

    Not true.. some K9's cant smell through 3-4-5- layers of airtight plastic bags. packaged right they should not smell anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for what sealer is good or not I can only speak about the foodsaver....they have different sizes of bags and also offer a "chose your own size" rolls.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I find the cost of the bags adds up quickly.. at 30 bucks for 32 bags and when your triple sealing a box wont last you that long.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as for the others.. your guess is as good as mine.. you can always try looking some up from the big box chains online and some of them may have  user reviews that could come in handy.

    vacuum sealing is useless; only delays the inevitable.

    get a 5mm heat sealer and metal laminate MBBs (the kind used to prevent static on electronic parts(3M)) if you actually want to stop the smell.

    Yes, vacuum sealing isn't perfect to start with... and yes, it weakens over time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But when we're talking about the duration that a domestic shipment is typically in the system (a few to several days), I think 2x and 3x vacuum seals are pretty effective, when done properly, in conjunction with other safety practices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, you're just looking to increase your chances of success -- it's not an all-or-nothing deal.

    Exactly! Before you do make sure you're well prepared and you'll find a lot of advice on forum here and elsewhere. One sort of people whom I avoid are ignorant, they're not worthy doing business with.

    Dogs have different levels of skill, but most are not able to sniff through packages that are carefully vacuumed 2 - 3X.  If your process is solid (wipe downs with rubbing alcohol and changing gloves in between layers) a standard vacuum sealer will be absolutely fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The more important aspect is making sure your package doesn't get flagged. Correct addresses and spellings, shipping from the same area code as the return address, etc.

    Have clean working station. Bag your product, then seal it. Set it in a "contaminated zone" something that can get residue on it. Change gloves and wipe down your sealer, work station and sealed product with a paper towel soaked in rubbing alcohol. Seal again. Repeat as necessary except do not set back in the neutral zone anymore. The point is that your final seal should have absolutely no contaminants on or near it. It helps to really isolate different parts of your work space for different steps in packaging, and once you find what works best, make it routine. There are a lot of different ways to go about packaging, but the best advice is just to be overly cautious.

    If you're that concerned, after you do your foodsaver vacuum double seal, put it all in an empty potato chip bag with the end clean so it seals properly, not much need to use vacuum, just seal it &amp; you'll be gold!
