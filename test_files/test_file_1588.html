    I was wondering...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do people get it shipped to post boxes under different names, or special places, or right to your house? is there a way to make it so if its caught at the place its shipped to it wont be traced back to you? or just right to the front door haha

    That's all part of the risk. Can't use fake names; they won't deliver if the name doesn't match up with the address

    That is not exactly true. Packages can definitely get delivered with a fake name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not saying that it may not raise a red flag. Or that a fake name may not cause an issue, but your blanket statement is wrong.

    i dont get it when people say they use drop points. surely it needs to be a legit deliverable address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im also trying to think of ways to get stuff delivered. there are no good affordable anonymous po boxes in the uk and you never know what a seller will do with your real name or address

    I live in an apartment and maybe once or twice every fortnight I'll get someone else's mail. The same person - have been for nearly 3 years.
    <br/>
    Xmas time I get Xmas cards that aren't even in my language.
    <br/>
    What would happen if I used this fake name and my order got intercepted by customs?
    <br/>
    Should I start writing fake letters with this persons name to make it seem more legit?

    If you DO use a fake name...or even a name that isn't yours at your residence, ALWAYS run test letters/packages to make sure it works.
