    Ah ok. For bud if you want real Blue Cheese I would go to my friend UKbluecheese, you can find his URL on my page and he's a friend of mine who I've worked with for years. I don't know if he will do next-day delivery but he may do if you explain the situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MDMA I would hit up Ivory (can't remember if he does next day delivery but maybe he does and he also does 2C-B so you can hit two birds with one stone with that one. If you haven't been with Ivory before I recommend him because his MDMA is absolutely bangin. I've shopped with him a few times now and it's been 10/10 quality every time. Not tried his 2C-B but I've heard good things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope this helps! :)

    And JWH-18 is a synthetic cannabinoid and is active at levels as low as 2mg. You sprinkle a bit into a spliff and you need 1-2 tugs and you will be good for a fair while. If you do it at higher doses it becomes kinda shroomy and you get 3D vision.

    Yeah I am not sure he does overnight but I know he is on the ball and it would get to you by Weds morning. As I said I have worked with him for years and he's a pro, otherwise I wouldn't be vouching for him and have his link on my thread. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I haven't tried the product no because I don't smoke dope, I just very occasionally cook with it. I know very little about weed to be honest, never been an area I have been that interested in or worked in. As I said though, the guy is a pro. If he says it's real Blue Cheese, it's real Blue Cheese.

     COPS: SUSPECT'S BUTT FILLED WITH COKE, POT, PILLS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MAY 11 -- In what may be a record for narcotics recovered from a suspectâs rectum, Vermont cops last week arrested a New York City man who hid large quantities of crack cocaine, marijuana, and Oxycodone inside his body.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alex Boulet, 29, is facing felony drug charges stemming from a May 4 traffic stop in Rockingham. Boulet, a Staten Island resident, was driving a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu when a state trooper pulled the vehicle over after it swerved across lanes around 11 PM.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     During a subsequent pat down of Boulet (who used the alias âElijah Jonesâ), a trooper âfelt a hard object, the approximate size of a golf ball that was separate from his genitals.â In short order, investigators secured a warrant to search Boulet -- via X-ray or other non-intrusive medical procedures -- for narcotics, according to a court affidavit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After an initial X-ray at a local hospital revealed a foreign object in his rectum, Boulet was given a laxative by hospital staffers (he also requested a cup of coffee). Boulet subsequently passed a plastic bag containing several other bags that contained a total of 84 crack rocks âall packaged individually.â
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After a second X-ray showed âmore foreign objects,â Boulet returned to the commode in his hospital room. He then passed two plastic bags containing a total of 218 Oxycodone pills. Boulet expelled the powerful painkiller from his rectum more than five hours after passing the crack cocaine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When a third X-ray revealed that Boulet was still holding, he was transferred to the intensive care unit of a second hospital. While there, he âpassed his fourth bag of contraband,â noted Trooper Kevin Hughes in the May 7 affidavit. The final bag -- covered like the others in unpleasantness -- contained 11.5 grams of marijuana.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As a result of his secret dispensary, Boulet was charged with possession of crack cocaine, marijuana, and a regulated drug. He is locked up in the Marble Valley Correctional Center in lieu of $50,000 bail.
