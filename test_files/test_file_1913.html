    i recently made a purchase and soon after it was marked 'in transit'. i was happy about this until i realised that i forgot to include a fucking name above my postal address. it's and overseas shipment and im concerned as to how badly this is going to turn out for me. already messaged vendor and no response yet..... FML. If anyone can shed some light on the issue of what happens to post with no name attached i would greatly appreciate it!

    It will most likely still go to your address, what else would happen to it? It's not like they can't find out where to take the package, they just don't know specifically who at the house will be receiving it, and that usually doesn't matter. As long as the address is correct, it will most likely be delivered normally.

    I agree and think it will just go to the adress on the letter. Its not out of this world to think that a company might have forgotten to put your name on.
