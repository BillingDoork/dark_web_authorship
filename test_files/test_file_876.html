    Don't put too much faith into accurate up-to-date tracking.  But I'm not sure.

    USPS tracking is the most useless service ever, I wouldn't put much faith in it.  If you're really concerned give them a call from a burner, otherwise just wait it out and the package will most likely show up at your doorstep.  I've had packages never even leave the state they were sent from, show up, and then never get marked as delivered before - I wouldn't stress about it too much.

    Shit happened to me one time as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was tracking my package and I see that it was delivered to a state 3,000 miles away! I start bugging out and ask what the hell happened and what do you know, gave me the wrong tracking.
