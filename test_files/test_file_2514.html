    Foreword
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Section Eight of the Canadian Constitution guarantees all Canadian citizens the freedom from unnecessary search and seizure. Canada Customs have been violating Constitutional law every time they search or seize my property without a search warrant issued by a judge. :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Furthermore, courier companies are enabling and cooperating with Canada Customs. So first we need to target the courier companies with lawsuits. Once the lawsuit with the courier company is exhausted and comes to an end we then target Canada Customs itself directly, which is a bit more of an in depth procedure. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The federal government loves to target young people and poor people when they break these Constitutional rights and freedoms. It is much easier to harass and exploit people who are downtrodden or in a weakened position. The federal government is a disease; a cancer that wants to promote capitalism and competition for everyone except the federal government. And as long as the only people who speak out against the government are poor and young, the feds then have an "easy kill" so to speak.  &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How To File A Lawsuit
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Step 1
    <br/>
    Google the name of your state/province + civil court small claims. Every province/state has a dedicated website for small claims. This website should have a list of courthouses that are close to you, as well as all the rules and procedures and other information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Step 2
    <br/>
    Head down to your local courthouse and ask the clerk "How do I file a small claim?" That's really all it takes folks. The clerk will guide you through the entire process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In Canadian provinces they will require that you do a corporate name search at the city registry (the same place you get a marriage license or many other licenses, city services etc). This costs $20 usually.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The filing fee for the civil claim is usually about $100. Well worth it though IMO since we all know that lawyers charge these large corporations $300-$500 per hour of service. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here are 3 examples of recent claims I have filed:

    <br/>
    Don't let the government bully you with fear tactics. Take a bit of initiative and stand up against tyranny. The government loves to use fear to gain more and more power. They create "grey areas" in the law in regards to chemicals to push further and further into our lives and our businesses. It's a joke and it's about time we start to stand our ground and fight back.  8)

    <br/>
    I am going to drag out my lawsuits against against these courier companies for as long as possible, and when they run their course I will then file lawsuits against Canada Customs... :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay tuned! :D

    Were any officially 'seized', or did the packages simply go 'missing'? I'm pretty sure you cannot sue in the event of damaged/misplaced goods, that is what insurance is for. I guess it's another story if they are flat out refusing to release your parcel though. I would consider trying to contact support or request to talk with someone higher to sort it out.
