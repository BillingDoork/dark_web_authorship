    I guess it is possible for a dog to be trained to locate benzos, but i doubt any of them currently are.

    Like don said, they can smell it if trained for sure.Â  Imagine chewing on a xanax bar how disgusting that TASTES, well taste and tell are intrinsically linked and I bet those dogs that are trained to sniff out pharms are miserable lol cuz the smell they gotta endure and search for would be nasty.

    I think joey took a few too many mg phenazepam? :P jk

    Dogs smell is fucking crazy. I swear I read they can smell 50 times better than a human being. Just like Quinone said. They can smell anything they are trained to. But I know the reason the Benzo powder suppliers don't make their shipments air tight. Alprazolam and Diazapam powder aren't passed around like heroin and cocaine and all those hard drugs. It would be a HUGE waste of time and money to train a dog to smell those powders, and have them get one hit every ten years. Who knows. Maybe these powders could get HUGE. Then it could be a possibility. Hell I remember reading a story about a High School drug dog trained to smell oxycontin, percocet, lortab - basically any pill that a High School student would abuse. Like I said. Their smell is phenomenal.

    I don't think they are either, someone posted a manual on sniffing dogs on the forum and the drugs they can sniff was very limited (mainly the popular ones like coke, mdma, weed, etc)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They have to be trained to sniff out a certain drug and there's too many to list, I remember I got upset when I ordered an RC from a vendor from overseas and it didn't even come vacuum sealed but then I realized dogs aren't even trained to smell RCs.
