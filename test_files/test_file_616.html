    i want to buy drugs that are scheduled in my country but am paranoid about doing so, how do i go about all of this with out getting caught? how does shipping work exactly? i want to remain anonymous so giving my actual address would be a bad idea, aye? i have never bought drugs from the internet before, so what is the best way to go about going this?

    I'm from the US and I just went about it by ordering and putting in my real address and name. I've done over ten orders and have not had a problem with LE so far.  My only problem so far has been  with dishonest or inadequate vendors.  There is no way to remain completely safe, this game is always going to have an amount of danger to it but you can minimize that with using pgp which is something I have not done and I probably should. You can use a fake name but I don't know if that will help, you need to test it first. Use a fake name on a non-silkroad related package and see if you receive it. Are you planning on ordering bulk or do you just want small items delivered?  With bulk you should probably take more precaution.  If something happens just deny it and don't talk to the LEA whatever you do. Deny, deny, deny.

    What problems are you having with PGP. I just recently figured out myself, and it's still fresh in my mind. I will help you out as best I can :)
