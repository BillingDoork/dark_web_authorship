    Hi, I'm looking for open a vendor account very soon and was looking for a bit of advice on shipping. I looking for the safest option between going to a local post office or using one the courier services here. There are UPS, FEDX and DHL offices here and have looking through their websites they offer a pick up service. Was thinking of giving a girl a buch of letters to give to a pick up guy at some location and have a friend watching from near by to make sure she hands them over to the courier. I could do the same with the local post office.
    <br/>
    I had also had an idea of opening a storage biz or some type of office facility. Renting a few rooms is cheap here and you could make up some contract with a ficticious person with a made up id and mail things out under a company in his name. I know it wouldn't be that easy if you got busted mailing letters to say you were doing it for guy who rents an office from you but its alot easy is this part of the world to rent a $60 a month office and apartment for PETER BRADY :)
    <br/>
    Any advice would be appreciated guys.
    <br/>
