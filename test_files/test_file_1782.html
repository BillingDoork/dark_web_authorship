    I'm going to be flying to the Caribbean and want to bring some MDMA with me, maybe 2 grams.  I'm thinking about double vac seal and mix it in with my carry on mixed in with wife's make up and such.  This wont really show up as an anomaly on the x-ray will it?  The  other option was to make capsules and mix in with regular vitamins of the same caps.  These wont be vac sealed.  What's the best way?  Or should I double vac seal and put in luggage mixed in with hygiene bag?

    Mail it to yourself.  :D Or wait till you get there and SR that shit. Your looking at like 2 week delivery time if not more and most vendors probably wont ship there, most packages are delivered by land, air, and then boat to your specific island, which some take an absurd amount of time for the goods and services boat to arrive, depending on your island. Other wise you better get real creative cause TSA don't play around.  :-X Once your on the island traveling between islands there is minimal or lack of security.

    Lol, I always crack up when I see threads like these. "Dearest SR users, how shall I bring illegal drugs on a plane to another country? Gotta have my drugs wherever I go, herp derpity derp."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stop right there. Consider the consequences of trafficking narcotics internationally.  That's almost always a  felony no matter the amount of substance. The enjoyment you may receive on holiday with MDMA is far outweighed by the strong possibility of being arrested (either during initial security screening or during customs. Not to mention all the stress you'll have when travelling. And most countries in the West Indies are notoriously harsh on drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me put it to you another way. If we're to assume that you're an average Joe, than you'd think that the other Joe who's doing the same thing you're about to do has considered a similar plan of action to smuggle the MDMA. And has thousands and thousands of other Joes who think they can outsmart LE and not be the one who gets caught. But a lot of them do get caught. You could be one of them. You're nothing special and there's no reason why you should be able to make a mediocre attempt to hide drugs in your luggage and smuggle it across the border.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The best idea I could think of would be to use a pill press and create pills of MDMA, but shape and color the pills (with markings and whatnot) on them, in order for LE to just think they're normal OTC pills. Don't use prescription pill look a likes. Put it in a caffeine bottle, anti-histamine bottle, or whatever works for the pills you've just made. I would think that would be the best option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other hand, you have to assume that LE has already considered every possible way drug smugglers would get drugs through airport security, so the probability of actually successfully trafficking drugs in this scenario is not an idea I would recommend whatsoever. Save the MDMA for when you return.

    I'm with DrChong on this one.  Why not just enjoy your awesome vacation to the beautiful Caribbean?  Get away from EVERYTHING, drugs included.  Is it really worth ruining your vacation, possibly your life as you know it just so you can get high there?  If your answer is yes I think your priorities might be out of wack and you need to reevaluate your life a bit.

    I have done this domestically with multiple drugs. Works flawlessly, with personal amounts at least. Buy a bottle of anything that comes in veg cap, empty as many caps as needed, fill with drug and make a dent on top of cap with fingernail. Then put back in bottle with the others- when u arrive empty bottle, look for dented pills and pop some molly. TSA is not looking for drugs.

    International travel is another story- I have never tried and not sure I would.

    What I would do, is, vac seal or mmb bag my drugs in a small cigar tube very neatly. I would then tie a piece of string to it. Right before its time to go, get the wifes pussy wet-insert and proceed to destination. 8)

    So, I love traveling to events to go party hard! I always fly (it's safer than driving!) and I always bring my own stuff with me (no where beats SR for reliability and quality!). If it's a prescription, I used to try to put it into an old bottle of one that looked similar. Now, I just throw it in anywhere. Same for narcotics.
    <br/>
    I had a friend that worked TSA and he was told to remember they are looking for bombs and guns, NOT drugs.
    <br/>
    Keep it in your carry on, don't be nervous, don't try to hide it really hard.
    <br/>
    If it's capsules, I'd put it in a jar that should contain capsules and then put that in your little toiletries bag. If I'm unsure of the chemical process that goes into making something, I'll be sure to not touch the zippers after touching drugs since that is the only chemical sniffing step. But I have had them wipe zippers and test them with a bunch of molly in the bag.

    Sorry my thoughts are scattered, I just woke up.

    While I appreciate the input, you're a bit hypocritical. Some might say that people who order drugs on the internet sent through the mail and discuss on drug forums need to re-evaluate their life as well.  It's about acceptable risk. My level is a little higher than yours.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I look at the pure volume of people going through a major airport and look at odds. I'm willing to gamble if I've done enough preparation and homework, especially with an easily hidden small amount.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think Ive come up with a pretty good idea now but suggestions are welcome.

    Dissolving? Tessellated is the man. Awesome idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thought about mailing too but too many variables as to delivery times and what not. For dissolving, my only issue with that might be if they quarantine/disallow certain foods down there and I had to throw it out.  I'll do some more research on their food customs.

    Good point, your food might get thrown out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Get a brand new washcloth and on each corner put 200mg of dissolved MDMA. When it is time to roll you just suck on it for a while. Will taste bad but hey, it will work.

    Also, that's kind of funny that you wouldn't view mailing something to your hotel as safe since that is how this whole website works ;) Perhaps just place an order and set up the delivery to be to your hotel through SR. Like discuss with the vendor what day to ship it so that it arrives the day you get there. Then you can have whatever you want sent to you into a place that won't have such tight customs.

    Best thing, take it before you get on to the plane and when in the Caribbean , buy better purity mdma. Or you could dissolve it. Or a boots vitamins bottle. or eat it then shit it, or tell your wife/mrs to hold your sleeping tablets :) Id take it before the plane cause i hate sitting for hours and watching people that are sober.

    Does leather material appears in airport scanning as organic matter? I Just thought about hiding my MDMA inside my leather wallet between all those plastic cards, Next week I'm heading for vacation and It's really crucial for me to have it, I'm thinking below 0.4g, what are the odds ?

    I'm going to be the unpopular one here, as while I totally disagree with doing this, having the knowledge can't hurt. An old roommate of mine came to me to ask how to go about taking a 2-week supply of his needed "pain medication" across the planet. I suggested mailing it to the hotel he'd first arrive at overseas, and then SR'ing it if he somehow didn't receive it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He told me he was too scared of showing up empty handed, and thus went with the carry on method. Considering that he later told me that you go in and out of customs at every single INTL stop, and that he went through 9 different security checkpoints, I figure he's one of the luckiest bastards alive. But - there is a chance that the information he found and used helped him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again - let me reiterate - if you're going from the USA, to country B for a layover, and then to country C, you will go through TSA in airport 1, through customs out of the gates in airport 2, then right back through customs in airport 2 to get to your gate, complete with passport check/stamp, and then repeat this process in every subsequent place you go. I believe the only exception is the EU, or at least once you're in the EU and stay within it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Airport security uses X-Ray as the primary screening tool - if you look up how it works, it's not exactly a walk in the park, but it has one possible flaw that can be exploited. Aside from coloring the types of materials (organic = orange), it shows them from top to bottom. A lot of things will appear transparent or not return a signature, but - anything that you'd be sneaking through in a bag is going to appear orange. If you're sneaking weapons, I hope you get caught - just my opinion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After he got back and seemed smug as fuck about "getting away with it," I asked him what he did. From what I was able to understand, my friend found a big list of items that show up as organic material that are also common carry-on basics. He packed his bag down about as tightly as it would go, and then just put the compressed bag in the 2nd row of 4-5  "orange" items. Rubber and leather are organic, so cameras, camera cases, gel soles for shoes, and even some non-orange returns like battery packs and other things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He claims he never had his carry-on searched once, and that he went all over Europe with the same stash he brought from home. So - if you're really, really, really, really convinced you want to A. not check the bag using the method above, and B. don't want to mail yourself whatever it is you must have, the only person I know of to intentionally game the TSA X-ray was this guy, and it did work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll end this post by saying if it hadn't worked, he'd be in prison somewhere and most definitely not enjoying himself, so seriously, seriously, seriously consider any sort of smuggling through airports (especially crazy ones like Heathrow or LAX) and ask yourself if rolling balls for a night in wherever is worth it. It's probably not.

    <br/>
    Having got that out of the way, just wrap it securely in plastic, then use more than 3 condoms, finishing with a 2mm thick layer of melted beeswax (keeps the shitty smells out) then insert deeply into rectum (yours, not hers!). Make sure you don't have any red flags when you fly- items related to drug taking, etc. You'll be fine, body scanners can't detect items in your body.

    Sorry mate, but it had to be said, there have been quite a few threads where scum bags have proposed to use innocent people in their dodgy schemes, from growing weed in some old dears attic to using other peoples luggage to smuggle things!
    <br/>
    Glad to hear you're not one! It's just that it wasn't clear, anyway, nough said.
    <br/>
    As to whether scanners can pick up internal objects, I was in a similar situation recently, I wanted to take some weed on holiday, I've had plenty experience prior to 9/11, but the "war on terror" has had unfortunate ramifications for airline security, so I wanted to play safe. I thoroughly checked on the net, and found nothing to suggest that they can pick up a non-metal object, secreted in the rectum, I didn't just go off here-say on forums, I checked into the technical aspects as well. You may want to make sure you have nothing that will act as a "tell" or flag, as that may result in more thorough checking, but anyway, I passed through the new scanner with a gram of BHO and a bit of weed, I didn't even coat it in beeswax, as I left it until the last 20 mins, to put in inside, and it was only there for 3 hours in total, just make sure you have a good shit before, so it's clean up there, lol. Just to clarify, the BHO was in a small plastic container just big enough for the oil, and that, with a couple of gram or so of weed, was thoroughly wrapped in cling film. Try to make it a torpedo shape, and use a bit of spit or vaseline (make sure you dump the vaseline, un-observed).

    Now I didn't read this whole thread but figured I'd share my experience with SUCCESSFULLY TRANSPORTING STUFF DOMESTICALLY VIA AIR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your airport has the full body x-rays that DISPLAY YOUR ENTIRE NAKED BODY, WHERE THEY CAN SEE YO DICK, DON'T DO THIS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if it just has the x-ray that displays a picture of a person, and circles locations that the scanner detects anomalies in, then you should be fine to transport small amounts of weed (obviously bagged) or pills, preferably unbagged but things like jell caps are fine, either in your pocket or preferably taped to the inside of your thigh or knee, or somewhere that they won't be felt if you end up getting patted down (if somehow the x-ray does red-circle that location on your body).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again, this has worked several times for me... But you may not be so lucky. Do a dry run so you know what type of x-ray to expect, never trust that you'll make it into a metal-detector only line (those were the good ol' days...) and be smart about it.

    NEVER travel with anything "taped to your leg", that is terrible advice, even if you knew it was the old style metal detector, you never know when there might be a security scare, that necessitates everybody being patted down! Your plane could be diverted to a Middle Eastern country, where that will get you a serious jail term (not a joke in many Middle Eastern countries). You should be able to find what equipment your airport uses by checking online, preferably using TOR. The safest, is to swallow it, but inside your rectum is usually all that is needed for personal amounts for a person with a clean criminal record and/or non-druggy appearance.

    modern xray machines see all kinds of different materials and they will show up as different colors. It messures the density of an object. they also are made to indicate on explosive material.
    <br/>
    they show up as different colors on the operators screen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you only have clothes and then a small baggie of somthing it will so up clearer than if that baggie was put into luggage with a varrity of differnt kinds of objects, throw some batteries in you luggage, your cell phone, plastics food, liquids... etc it makes the image harder to read. the operator will usually only look at a givin piece of luggage for 5-10 seconds so make the image he is looking at confusing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i have seen and done these ways succesfully
    <br/>
    - small baggies vaccum packed in put into a money belt
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -take your desired dose mdma put in gel caps then finish filling with regular suppliment, add 1 to each day of a vitamin pill organizer.( example of what im talking about, http://www.activeforever.com/large-7-day-weekly-pill-organizer?adtype=pla&amp;gclid=CMSCjpys77kCFcs9QgodFQYArQ)
    <br/>
    I was on a flight with my gf and we got pulled into secondary and i told them they were vitamins because my gf is preggo. they didnt look at it twice and we went thru just fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    small amounts will usually get thru just fine if you are smart about it, of course im not saying you should try ;)

    I have flown many times with both rx painkillers and mdma capsules, without issue. I have never, ever seen airport security or customs look closely at the pills in anyone's pill bottles, and you can rest assured I was paying very close attention the first few times when I was extremely worried. I'm talking about many scores of domestic flights, and dozens of international flights, and I've yet to see or hear of it happening. Pre-flight airport security is trying to prevent terrorism, and customs are looking to catch major smugglers. They simply don't care to search anyone to the level you're worrying about. Just make some capsules and put them in a pill bottle of some sort.

    ^This.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    capped up MDMA in an over-the-counter pill bottle can go anywhere with you - if you put 120mg or so of X in a capsule, make sure to fill the rest with cornstarch or some other powder similar in color so the caps don't look almost empty.  In addition, weed edibles are pretty much fool proof- 99.2% of travelers are carrying snacks with them in their carry on. I've taken 100's of domestic fights and many international trips with brownies and never had a problem ever. For international, I always put most of the edibles in checked baggage and carried on only what I needed for the flight.  I always put brownies in double ziploc bags, and I have walked right by dogs in European airports. Had my luggage confiscated and searched by FBI/TSA over a bomb scare and my brownies were returned to me with the rest of my stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember - using USPS to ship drugs relies on hiding in plain sight, and that should be your goal when traveling with drugs, as well.  There are countless people going through the same checkpoints that you are going through, and they all have pill bottles, snacks, whatever - no one is going to single you out for special attention unless you act hinky.  Be careful, and even be a little paranoid, but don't act that way.

      I have flown many times with both rx painkillers and mdma capsules, without issue. I have never, ever seen airport security or customs look closely at the pills in anyone's pill bottles, and you can rest assured I was paying very close attention the first few times when I was extremely worried. I'm talking about many scores of domestic flights, and dozens of international flights, and I've yet to see or hear of it happening. Pre-flight airport security is trying to prevent terrorism, and customs are looking to catch major smugglers. They simply don't care to search anyone to the level you're worrying about. Just make some capsules and put them in a pill bottle of some sort.

     ^This.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     capped up MDMA in an over-the-counter pill bottle can go anywhere with you - if you put 120mg or so of X in a capsule, make sure to fill the rest with cornstarch or some other powder similar in color so the caps don't look almost empty.  In addition, weed edibles are pretty much fool proof- 99.2% of travelers are carrying snacks with them in their carry on. I've taken 100's of domestic fights and many international trips with brownies and never had a problem ever. For international, I always put most of the edibles in checked baggage and carried on only what I needed for the flight.  I always put brownies in double ziploc bags, and I have walked right by dogs in European airports. Had my luggage confiscated and searched by FBI/TSA over a bomb scare and my brownies were returned to me with the rest of my stuff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Remember - using USPS to ship drugs relies on hiding in plain sight, and that should be your goal when traveling with drugs, as well.  There are countless people going through the same checkpoints that you are going through, and they all have pill bottles, snacks, whatever - no one is going to single you out for special attention unless you act hinky.  Be careful, and even be a little paranoid, but don't act that way.

    Smell isn't an issue with capsules?  I've done this domestically a few times but I'm concerned about dogs internationally.

    Well, i had to do some job-related flights within the EU and I was to lazy/afraid for seeing/talking to a doctor about my fear of flying.
    <br/>
    So i bought Alprazolam from SR (in form of blotters), double sealed them and put them into the entrails of my laptop.
    <br/>
    Six flights and no problem so far...

    Is it a good idea to stash a really tiny amount of mdma maybe around 0.3 gram inside a thick leather wallet?  Ide thought any leather clothing will appear like organic material in scanning so it won't be that suspicious, I'm not much into replacing it with vitamins or methods like that, It's a really tiny amount worst case i get caught and just admit that i forgot it their or something.

    You can easily mix them up in a vitamin bottle containing similar looking capsules.  They don't have reagent tests or anything in the Caribbean they're just looking for the obvious stuff like baggies and such.  HOWEVER, if you get caught, the punishments can be extremely severe, and suddenly your vacation turns into a nightmare.

    I hope you know if you get caught and admit to it, even if it's a small amount, there's no way they're just going to forget about it.
    <br/>
    I also hope you mean to put the wallet in your luggage or carry on, and not just be carrying it in your pocket (still not the best idea but).
