    So now that TOR and SR has been gaining popularity in New Zealand we have been seeing a lot of new users joining the forum looking for information. With this has come the unwanted attention from hack news reporters who have nothing better to write on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's great that interest is increasing in New Zealand but it's time to start taking this a little more seriously. We're not 100% anonymous nor are we above the law so we need to take some steps in ensuring we all stay safe. The other threads pertaining to New Zealanders were closed and deleted at our request because discussion has recently become more flagrant with talk of where to buy from, which vendors to use, packaging and the likes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The more we boast about it, the easier our mail becomes to profile and target and we would be stupid to think that law enforcement doesn't browse these forums (we already know reporters do and they don't paint a pretty picture). The goal of this thread is to keep us a little bit safer and therefore we have some basic rules that need to be followed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Rules
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - No discussion on which vendors you should use. There are plenty of vendor review threads elsewhere on these forums and most worthwhile vendors will have relevant information on their SR page (if not just send them a message). If all else fails, I’d recommend sending a private message to other Kiwi users. More often than not we’re willing to help out and give recommendations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - No discussion on the type of packaging a vendor uses. It puts the vendor and customers at risk as it becomes easier to profile their mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Don’t come in here and ask why your mail from the Netherlands hasn’t arrived after two weeks. Mail from the Netherlands usually raises a flag no matter what country you’re in. They’re listed as a known drug producing country so my advice is just don’t bother. It might be a bit cheaper but it’s 99% guaranteed to be caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Use the search function. If you have a general question regarding SR or bitcoins it has most likely already been answered elsewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the vendors; thanks for all your hard work. We really appreciate it. If you’re shipping to New Zealand, please keep us updated.
    <br/>

    This thread got quoted in the Herald just this morning. It shows infectionnz is completely correct about being inconspicuous, have one thread that kiwis post in, and if there is a stupid post, remove it.
    <br/>
    Link:
    <br/>
    http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10819029
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also was wondering (as im a first time buyer) what the average success rate is coming into nz, obviously don't give any vendor specifics. I once ordered a bong (mad scientist v3, piece of art almost) from grasscity which was seized by customs despite being unused and being labeled as a vase, however that being said it came from NL, which is from the reading I have done quite a hot country for our immigration.  The article linked above makes it out like they are catching heaps of contraband, but the Herald is bias and sensationalist at the best of times. Would waiting for a month or so before I buy be worth it?  Finally are there any NZ specific things to look out for (like avoid country such as NL and PAK), again avoid specifics, but if it is crucially important PM me please.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry if these are noob questions, but i figure that my fellow country men can answer questions with anecdotal advise rather than premonition from internationals.

    I think that reporter has got writers block or something. It's been in the papers around the world recently. He probably thinks he's hot shit when in reality he's just regurgitated someone else's article with a kiwi spin on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your bong would have got seized because it's a fairly obvious item. Customs isn't stupid and they know a bong from a vase (and who import a vase when they can get one from the kitchen shop?).

    A new article from the nzherald - non SR related though. Just thought I'd pop in and share.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They really love to boast about the money figures don't they. I did a bitta calculating to see how much they valued the cannabis.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    280kg  &gt;  $5,600,000
    <br/>
    1kg  &gt;  $20,000
    <br/>
    1oz  &gt;  $560
    <br/>
    1g  &gt;  $20
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Holy shit right, who the hell pays over $500 for an ounce?  ??? I sure as fuck don't.
    <br/>
    They just based it off the fact that Every gram is worth $20. lol. Only which it would on the street, but its unlikely 280kg of weed is going to be sold in tinnies huh!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But damn they nabbed alot of people this time, 2500, I feel sorry for em...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Police recognise that cannabis continues to be a major issue for New Zealanders and causes widespread harm to the community through health issues caused by addiction and related crime such as thefts and burglary," Mr Berry said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "A recent UN report highlighted New Zealand's consumption of cannabis, putting us amongst the highest users in the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "We remain committed to disrupting the business end of illicit drugs - that means targeting the growers and the dealers."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Addiction? Come on...   They're fighting a losing war, do they expect to completely eradicate cannabis from NZ or something? Shit man the government really needs to open their eyes and stop wasting time/money. It's useless. IMO

    Not me, depends on location I guess, but don't mention specific countries. Did you order from NL? If you did well thats the reason, but I assume you didn't. How long you been waiting for? I just recieved a few orders these last couple of days, and am expecting a couple more over the next week.

    Really? Bitcoins are sitting at around $15.5NZ at the moment. The listing price is 4.2btc + 0.5btc for shipping. So that comes out at around $72.85NZ just for 2.5 grams. I guess if it's really nice bud then that's OK but still.

    This bit is quite telling
    <br/>
    <br/>
    " he had a sobering message for Customs. “This is happening all over New Zealand a lot. Customs aren't able to stop it. Bitcoins and the website are secure and untraceable, but what's not are telephones and texts - and that's how we got caught.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    looks like they were caught via IRL activities ( new supply of drugs in small town noticed by local plod ?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    or this
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ". But eventually gangs took notice, he said, and they resented dealers on their turf. “If you lie down with dogs you wake up with fleas.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so grassed up by the local mob/black power . ?

    that pretty much what the article says,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    plus if you add it up, their cant be to many sources for high quality pills,2c-b or heroin in Morrinsville so Im sure the local cops would have picked that up from local informants.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The cell phone intercepts would have started and its all down hill from there .Thats probably why the police started watching the mail to his house, He will have told them he was using SR to source the drugs himself AFTER he was busted would be my guess.

    So NZ customs have been working tirelessly lately...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Apparently a few days ago my friend's flatmate got a visit from two customs dudes. They had a picture of a letter that was addressed to that address, and inside that letter they had found MDMA (oh ma gosh!). They didn't stay long, my friend obviously claimed ignorance (she's not involved anyway). I guess the only good thing was that they weren't too threatening or anything. Just said that if it happens again they'll get a search warrant.. (which I don't really believe, but yeah)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's kind of weird, I haven't had anything go missing for like 2+ months, so I don't know if they were fucking around with something they found ages ago, testing it etc.. but I guess they thought it was a good idea. What a fucking huge waste of time though.. haha (for them). I'm pretty sure they can't touch any of us.. at all. The house is clean. I'm off site. They'd have to do so much work.. and for 2 grams of MDMA? Fuck, give me a break.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Probably will take a step back for a while though, don't like the heat.

    Without going into detail, do you think the packaging was up to standard in this case? If you have an inkling of course. I'm about to make my 1st SR buy soon, so a little bit edgy but not plotting a large order anyway.

    Can't say dude, if it's from the transaction I think it is, then I haven't used him before. But from what I recall from feedback, his packaging was meant to be good? I think? The guy went offline right when I made my order, I got a 100% refund too cos I thought he didn't send it, so it's kind of weird.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In any case, I think it's a bit of a lottery. I've had some really shoddy packages get through over the years (from sellers not on SR). But also I've had a lot not get through. Never has anything come from it though.. just been the risk of losing money. I don't think it's really put me off, yeah sure having customs dudes turn up at your friends house is a fairly stressful event for everyone. But it's not like they can actually do anything.. and if they would ever consider faking a delivery and then raiding the house over a gram of mdma.. I'd face palm so hard I'd need to get institutionalized anyway. I'll just change the target house and we're good to go. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just get that first order under your belt and try not to stress about it dude. If you're doing it sensibly then IMO, there really is minimal risk.

    NZ is such a small place, a thread like this could bring bad attention on us. Also, morrinsville is a bloody hole. Don't know how he thought 181 pills would get through okay. Maybe they had in the past but it was risky imo. I knew a guy who worked as a posty, he would have litres of GBL sent to an addy on his route under a name he'd recognise. He'd pick it out and keep it when it came time to deliver it. An excellent trick. I don't know what eventually happened to him

    I believe the vendor snapper is referring to is nzfimports, search that name on the site and you'll find him. He's only got one listing atm, for 25-I blotters.

    On topic, I ordered from FinestKiwiBuds, and for some reason it didn't arrive the first time which was strange. But he reshipped for free and fattened the bags up a touch and they arrived perfectly fine in two days. The weed is top quality, I got Super Lemon Haze and Skunk. Both are very damn nice smokes, my long time smoker friends agree so too, we can not find weed of this quality at all in our area so it's a nice treat. Smoking on some now as a matter of fact, very nice stone

    I have done very little research into the matter cause the search function is a bit crappy and i can't seem to find topics relating to it. And its the weekend so i can't go to my local post office and look at their products. I may have remembered a specific express envelope/satchel to/from NZ/Aus, would that be the way to go?

    You should read the rules of this thread, says we can't discuss the packaging vendors use, it's for everyones safety. But I've ordered weed multiple times from Aus, and also LSD tabs from Aus too. Always made it through no hassles at all. I haven't ordered pills from Aus, but had pills come in from other countries so it's not at all impossible.

      On topic, I ordered from FinestKiwiBuds, and for some reason it didn't arrive the first time which was strange. But he reshipped for free and fattened the bags up a touch and they arrived perfectly fine in two days. The weed is top quality, I got Super Lemon Haze and Skunk. Both are very damn nice smokes, my long time smoker friends agree so too, we can not find weed of this quality at all in our area so it's a nice treat. Smoking on some now as a matter of fact, very nice stone

    I understand specificaly you can't talk about ways to disguise the products, My question was more around customs, do they still check even though its from Aus? Do they go through the same scrutiny that other overseas parcels do? or is it considered another state of australia?

    Seems like there's really only two ways: bitNZ and Mt.Gox. BitNZ is unreliable so that's not really an option. And surely everyone here doesn't use Mt.Gox?

    I don't want to give away my source because once they sell off what they've got they're stopping. So limited stock. After that I have no idea what I'll do. Maybe just wire money to MtGox in large amounts. Gis the link would ya man

    Mt Gox isn't totally anonymous though is it? I thought to purchase through them you'd have to deposit money using your bank account which can obviously be traced back to you.

    I'll probably just get it off that same guy from localbitcoins.com for a few weeks. Hopefully by then the online deposits for bitNZ will be reactivated so I'll just switch over to that from now on. Seems there's a lot of sellers on there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mt.Gox would be more worthwhile if you're buying more than say 30 BTC or something. I think the bank transfer fee is around $30-40 all up (including the fee for them receiving it), but you can buy BTC at a market price of around $14 instead of $15 as is common on bitNZ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd try bitNZ if you're buying them in relatively small amounts every week or so. Otherwise, Mt.Gox isn't a bad option (the only other option really).

    Best way to get BTC; I wont give too much away - but:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly, it's best to just send cash to someone (ie a exchange vendor) and have that person give you the BTC.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vladimar was a prime example of how easy it was. A really good private BTC vendor. Untill he went AFK - And stole some persons money. Not sure what happened there. Was a but like the Tony story.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I wont reccomend any one. But do a bit of research. Cash is the most easiest and safest way.   BTC exchanging is legal.

    Nah sorry mate. He doesn't have any listings up either.

    Is it safe to send NZ addresses to someone with no feedback who is also in NZ?

    I'm staying away from funforeveryone (NZ vendor with Molly) for that very reason.

    I was definitely surprised, even allowing for optimism, usually it'll be AT LEAST a full week. At least it has been when I've ordered from even closer locations and different RC websites overseas.

    From Stuff.co.nz- "Customs examines an average of about 5000 to 7000 international mail items a month. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a brand new member I don't like the sound of those stats- so will stick with domestic for now. Only one NZ vendor currently doing MDMA (wont name them here) - only have 2 trades under their belt, also no branded pics of product. Also their pricing is bloody good for NZ, maybe too good? A gram of MDMA usually goes for around $350- which is a good $100+ cheaper than these guys. Should I be concerned about this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess that's the tricky part for vendors- they need to get their stats up to build trust but without the stats we have to be sensible &amp; not trust them. I'm sounding paranoid I know but this is widely known about now and I've gone too many years without getting busted to fuck it up now...

    He most likely got arrested. Customs aren't taking this new way of drug importation lightly so really it's not worth it. I have 3 friends who have been caught in the last two months, One of them rented a house with fake details for the delivery address and the police traced him to his real home and connected the dots. The other two got busted using PO Boxes. I also heard of someone else I know in Hamilton who got busted but can't confirm if it was for importing stuff but I know he did use this site. The 3 mates of mine who got caught only got a few grams at a time of MDMA and some blotters it wasn't even big amounts.

    yeah I got one from Sweden that took 5 days total and some of those days were on a weekend. Extraordinary for me. It even beat orders I'd placed 10 days earlier from nearby. Also nzfimports contacted me today on the main site and confirmed that it had been sent. It was done courier so I'm expecting it tomorrow if done today like it's been marked as. Will update this with a trip report of his stuff asap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, regarding your mates being busted. I must say I think your story sounds fishy, the one about a guy renting a place under a fake name just for the address. You're telling me, this mate of yours rented a house JUST for the address and had that kind of money? With enough money to be paying for whole houses he doesn't need, he couldn't get a PO box under a fake address? or even pay a guy to receive his stuff? It's not hard to have them sent to a house on the street that's empty. Or a friend who's willing to receive them for you. You can rent a PO box at a lot of dairies and places with no ID needed. Or a falsified bank statement. Maybe you're telling the truth but it seems pretty strange to me mate.

    The house was a shitty 1 bedroom for $170 a week or there abouts so really its not much money and he also used the house for storage so if he had illegal stuff he could leave it there and not have it at his real home. Its not really my business on what he used the house for that's just what he told me and either way it didn't work out for him.

    You need ID for all PO boxes but doesn't have to be a New Zealand ID. Just any picture ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my opinion I would never get a friend to receive my items as that's just one more person who is involved and doesn't need to be. All i'm saying is be careful ordering illegal stuff from overseas, Its customs job to sniff out contraband and there is always one cowboy who is very good at his job.

    I've placed my 1st order from the UK - it's been about 14 days, so typically what's the expectation for delivery from there? I'm just trying to get a feel for how things roll. I think someone had put that it can take anywhere from 7-21 days. Just being wary before ordering another item or two.

    We thought it appropriate to reply to this. We generally advise suspicion and paranoia, its a drug dealers best friend, especially ordering within the same country - it removes the risk of customs but we assume our customers will always have a fear that it may be LE collecting names. There is very little we can say in response to this of course, other than we arn't cops. The only thing we can do is continue to build our reputation and customer base. To anyone who has tried the product, please leave reviews in our review thread here: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41981.msg459557#msg459557
    <br/>
    Other than that, a shout out to the silk road community - we hope we can provide a decent service going into the future. We are currently ironing out some kinks in our systems, we have found becoming a vendor is quite the learning curve, we hope to continue to improve our service to a super pro level. Did we mention we have John Key blotter?

    Haven't tried it but am currently shopping around for new sources since my old one packed it in. Though it's not too hard to set up Mt Gox as an international payee at your bank, then you can transfer money to their acc with your special reference number to buy bitcoins directly. I'd do it if I wasn't so damn skint this week. Will probably be skint next week too. Paying back someone very nasty who I foolishly allowed myself to get in debt too. Not the type you want to owe

    China is flagged for their Contact NT / pseudophedrine shit. I would say some places in SE Asia are flagged, because of the golden triangle.

A few years ago I got a parcel of oxycontin from Karachi, Pakistan. No problems. Also from the same region I've received hundreds of benzos.

    An old ex drug smuggler I met, who'd since retired after a huge sentence, told me that they would go to Singapore for heroin in the 80s. Send over a young couple and strap them with kgs and then send them back to Australia, except instead of going straight there, they'd go to Papua New Guinea  and bury / stash the bricks there. Then he'd fly from New Zealand to PNG, get them and fly home. That way they'd basically avoid going from a country of high suspicion straight to one with decent security. Singapore - PNG was fine because PNG back at that time was prehistoric by modern standards. No security whatsoever. And of course Australia to PNG or PNG to NZ etc.

    So you would agree that if two packages (one from the UK and one from Holland) arrived at customs and both were the same look and feel, one wouldn't be chosen for closer inspection ahead of the other based on point of origin?

     So you would agree that if two packages (one from the UK and one from Holland) arrived at customs and both were the same look and feel, one wouldn't be chosen for closer inspection ahead of the other based on point of origin?

        China is flagged for their Contact NT / pseudophedrine shit. I would say some places in SE Asia are flagged, because of the golden triangle. Also parts of the middle east that are renowned for heroin. But still, just because they're meant to be a high risk country doesn't mean you won't receive from them. A few years ago I got a parcel of oxycontin from Karachi, Pakistan. No problems. Also from the same region I've received hundreds of benzos.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        An old ex drug smuggler I met, who'd since retired after a huge sentence, told me that they would go to Singapore for heroin in the 80s. Send over a young couple and strap them with kgs and then send them back to Australia, except instead of going straight there, they'd go to Papua New Guinea  and bury / stash the bricks there. Then he'd fly from New Zealand to PNG, get them and fly home. That way they'd basically avoid going from a country of high suspicion straight to one with decent security. Singapore - PNG was fine because PNG back at that time was prehistoric by modern standards. No security whatsoever. And of course Australia to PNG or PNG to NZ etc.

    It's just splitting hairs now. We can all agree they check for certain signs and things. The smell of coffee or some kind of perfume and a package coming from The NL? That's a big red target. Funnily enough, rather then helping cover the smell, coffee smell's usually is a dead give away that something's smell is being covered.

    yeah, but that would've looked pretty uniformly on an x-ray. Unlike say a bag of coffee, with a plastic wrapped parcel inside. But yeah, I don't know any SR vendors trying that perfume covering stuff. That's amateur shit. I've been getting shit online for a while now and never personally encountered those crappy tactics thank god. Funnily enough, 5 years back, I bought some oxycontin from an IOP and customs opened them, were unable to identify them I guess and put them back. But the package had been cut open and resealed with special marked tape along with a note indicating they'd searched it. Before I sent drugs in the mail I also used to get a friend to send me switchblades and butterfly knives, which I'd sell to my mates at a huge markup.

    Hi, anyone else experiencing big delays from Europe? I'm at 25+ days now from a particular vendor who, from what I can gather is legit but has been swamped with orders. Would be helpful if I could mention their name but not cool to do so here. Have been scanning the rumor mill forum and USA customers are experiencing similar delays from this vendor. Just keen to hear from kiwis. The real fucker is until this order arrives I can't place another one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also interested to hear if any kiwis have received a love letter from nz customs? Half expecting one any day now!

    i'm at 2 and a half weeks. i'd seriously recommend that you lot dont order from the netherlands, chances are it wont arrive. i recommend order from the U.K and USA, i have had luck with Germany but i try to stay away from Europe. if you're into your E then i say get MDMA rather than pills - its easier to get through. As for customs letters i've never received one, even though iv had packages go AWOL before.

    i always change my addy after this happens but im thinking of opening a p.o box. Anyone got any advice or experience on this? PM if you can help

    i use MTGOX for btc, but they've tightened up their AML and i've had to send them proof of my identity to get funds unfrozen. shit myself at first but realized its all just protocol, still gonna stay away for a little bit and use other methods.

    <br/>
    Was wondering what everyones experience with ordering from Germany is? It seems alot of goods around seem to be from the Netherlands or Germany, but would not be looking to put trust in the former.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many Thanks!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    peace

    Would anyone here be interested in buying oxycontin from a nz seller? i can get 20mg oxy norms (fast release caps) and 20 40 and 80mg oxycontins (slow release but crushable). i can get a medium quantity of these, but considering the high price of becoming a seller i would need to know there is some interest. what price would people be prepared to pay? the going rate seems to be about 1btc for 10mgs for international sellers. your thoughts?

    Hello everyone from NZ, I am glad to see other domestic posters, and am sure there are many more lurking.
    <br/>
    I am new to SR, I had heard of it, but always assumed it was too good to be true (maybe it is), however I am an active member of other sites like tripme and 4chan.
    <br/>
    I am interested if anyone has advice or information regarding online anonymity specifically in New Zealand, I realise a Google search is a good thing, but it's obviously Emerica-heavy.  All I currently have is the Tor browser bundle installed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From the media it seems we have it pretty hard with the new laws against "illegal" downloads, and authorities who act above the law, can we help each other out?

    Mate read the forums. Search for the following terms: why use tor, pgp encryption (read Pine's thread), bitcoins New Zealand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Find the drug you want most, find vendors you like the look of and locate their review pages on the forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The objective of learning how to cover your tracks and buy with anonymity is to minimise the link between you and any drugs that arrive in your mailbox. In order to achieve this you need to behave like you don't exist online.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I strongly recommend you read as much as possible on the forums and try not to be lazy by asking questions that may have been answered on the forums before. A lot of peeps on SR have been around for ages and have heard the same questions a thousand times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The more clued up you are the safer for yourself and everyone here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also try to keep this on the downlow. This isn't the darknet for nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally don't mention this on tripme, it's not condoned and those guys simply don't get SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck.

    Well he said it was a tax invoice which means customs believed it was a legal substance. Don't think ill believe it unless he uploads a pic of the letter. Love letters seem to be very rare for non-prescription drugs in nz, in fact earlier in the year there were a few reports of police visits over amounts as small as a gram of coke/mdma etc.

     Well he said it was a tax invoice which means customs believed it was a legal substance. Don't think ill believe it unless he uploads a pic of the letter. Love letters seem to be very rare for non-prescription drugs in nz, in fact earlier in the year there were a few reports of police visits over amounts as small as a gram of coke/mdma etc.

    You'd think they would err on the side of suspicion if they weren't sure of what it was and test the damn thing.

    I'd happily pay an invoice on some mdma ;D

    Maybe the vendor sent some random powder not actually Molly...

    How do you knw it was "definately" MDMA when you havent touched it yet. or are you just dbasing this on the assumption that once NZ customs tasted it they were so loved up they decided to send you a tax invoice, instead of a SWAT team?

    Hey guys
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Come harvest time here in Aotearoa, I am considering vending half pounds here on SR (New Zealand customers only). I will have a few fine strains which are acclimatized and well established and are grown with cert organic materials. Strains include Hindu Kush, AK47 and a Bubbleberry/Afgan cross. There may even be a slim chance for some Northern Lights.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its just a thought at the moment. Usually its super easy to get irl come harvest, so it may not be worth the hassle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would there be any interest at all for this service in New Zealand?

    people wont tell you shit, police/customs read these forums so people give very little information. especially since nz is so small.

    if you cant figure out how to get bitcoins or setup drop boxes etc you most likely shouldnt be ordering..this isnt a game son.

    I wouldn't take things too personally. I think its the fact that New Zealand is so very small, and with a limited amount of resources for any given thing, finding your own way to the goodness is usually the safest option on these forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you Google/Startpage search through Tor and do some research, there is really only one viable way to get bitcoins in New Zealand. Otherwise you are working through an overseas company, and f that. Took me a few weeks to suss out the easiest pathway to bitcoin heaven, and now everyting is hunky dory.

    Does anyone know if NZ post offices care about using completely different names, I know this applies in the US of A but i'm sure NZ post will still deliver your package regardless of the name. Like a friend could order something to his friends place.

    I wouldnt worry about it myself tbh i mean people are allowed boarders and even around this time to early next year students are always looking for a place to board so I guess it would be paranoia vs logic. Otherwise the next 'professional' thing to do is put a 'c/-' infront of the name as 'in care of'..' Also just from reading other posts on this forum, im surprised by what can come through the mail friends and I have purchased 5 - 10 mdma pills several times without any problems whatsoever, the same with a few other chemicals but have only brought no more than a gram, isnt it like kids at a candy store when you do receive a package :) love this site it works just hope there will be more kiwi vendors eventually.

    Hey everyone, new to the forums, but have bought and received small items off SR recently (half a sheet of acid and a small amount of DMT), which came through no worries as expected, but what I am more concerned about is international weed. I looked through this thread and couldn't find any information on whether or not weed gets through customs! Is there anyone out there that has experience buying weed internationally or just an opinion about it that can tell me if it would be safe shipping a large amount of weed (QP-1/2 LB) from somewhere relatively inconspicuous, such as South Africa or Canada, into NZ? What's the chance of it getting through customs? If it's too much can someone tell me what would be a safe amount of weed to ship here? I've looked at the (very limited) domestic options for weed, but it's a bit pricey, which makes me want to go to an international source. Anyways, ANY information at all on this subject would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

    After moving back from melbourne to new zealand (living in melb 2003-2009) Yes the ice/meth was awesome in melbourne and good prices however alot of cuts as well so people nd up smoking/iv more in australia, when I got back to nz I was shocked by the cost, but the quality was excellent and ive found not many meth cooks/dealers cut there gear here its mainly 'pure', I mean in melbourne friends and I would go through an 8ball in a night (some dealers try and passoff speed/base as meth too which burns the same as p), but back here just 1 gram in nz will knock your socks off without the need for a couple more grams. My mates back in melbourne can pay $800 for an 'uncut and pure' gram of ice/meth prettymuch the standard of nz meth. Alot of kiwis probably dont even realise that the gear here is fucking wicked shit!! Besides the aussie guy on SR his cost for half/whole gram is the same price as nz streetmeth FYI.
    <br/>
    TBH I dont mind paying $100 a point as sometimes thats all I need and again in australia id need at least x2 points anyway. So in the end both countries have got it tough, buy the shit from USA and Canadian vendors ive received a couple no problems if at just a gram $165 nz for a gram is even better and equivalent to the quality of nz gear, just my 5c worth though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    note: next time you buy a point, gram here check the crystals are they whitish or clear see through!! 9/10 it is clear as glass=the best, but also because kiwi cooks use the hype reaction method which is premium, alot of aussie cooks use the redphos method!

    GO FOR IT!! lol again try not to listen too much to other peoples comments as in yeah sure you can buy weed here but is sour diesel, blueberry kush+medicinal weed and hash (besides bubble hash made) easily available here NO a majority of nz skunk/indoors is of afghan strain or many variants of afghan strain, well besides auckland many awesome strains there. Anyway iv brought half an ounce from the states (sour diesel) and it got through no problem I wasnt really paranoid about it than the meth and coke I purchased knowing that weed isnt much of a jurisdiction here than the class a's anyway (besides hash class b though) And a friend received 50grams of morrocan hash from belgium or somewhere over there and it got through, same with my 5gram hash which was just beautiful! So yeah I cant comment on anything more than the 1/2 ounce that I recieved so best of luck to your decision mate!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FYI: the 1/2 ounce was still intact not squashed to infinity and was still quite discreet as well, no smell but had been double vacuum packed, dont forget to tell vendors to not forget to wash the outerbag before they package it to take away any tiny remnants of smell for the dogs.

    This comes down to simple economic factors. The US/Canada meth amrket is so competitive that you have to sell qualiy gear at a low price otherwise your customers will just move on to the next mug with a meth lab around the corner. In Australia its hard to get the precursors and everyone wants it at the moment meaning a small amount is in high demand so to increase weight it must be cut and then sold for such a high price. Bit of a catch 22 isnt it. What i dont understand is how australian meth addicts seem to be travelling better then US counterparts i see on cops. The american meth addicts seem to be the poorest of the poor yet you would think that with the prices they pay for such good shit they would be easily able to afford it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    btw some of the best meth ive ever had has been yellowish tinted and some of the worse has been beautiful looking clear-long shards so if you dont have a lab and chemistry background you can only really go on the feeling you get as even the taste doesnt come into it as pure meth is supposedly suppose to be tasteless. Even then ive seen people use different ROA out of the same bag and have completely different reactions so who knows.

    The reason for not buying it from somebody (not online) locally, is because of price and quantity. The bud here is much more expensive than on SR, and I do not have access to the quantity that I'm looking for.

    Yeah the yellow stuff here we call 'feijoa' as it is yellow and has an aftertaste of feijoa, very nice and samehere have had fat ice chunks that tested as methamphetamine but was total shite, like could go to sleep right away sort of thing and baronone euphoria, the reason being again the cooks letting the crystals  grow for a longer period method, hence shitier product. Here the cooks find the precursors harder to get as well but there definately is no shortage here though and probably never will be the demand is through the roof for prettymuch 10years strong, the price never changes unless someone buys an ounce and wants to rid product quick aka $600 gram. The main ingredient usually is imported from asia via contacNT (or sudomol 60mgs as being the only prescription available under strict policies) and also iodine balls + hype is used ALOT in the dairy and racetrack industry . What I do wish NZ could do with is some of that Aussie base/gas speed which again is exclusive to Australia alone beats polish speed and EU amphetamine x100 and also smokes real good in the pipe as well.
    <br/>
    As for USA/Canada they have everything WE WANT lol and to a degree the Netherlands :) soooo not fear, but at least with SR it gives an opportunity for people to buy from their PC without the need for being a 'drug tourist'..

    Some thing just doesn't seem normal about him but I think its just his excessive use of capitol letters that puts me off haha

    Id like to see an official review thread for him so he could gain so credibility as he does offer a variety of products.

    RE Flipdingo -I agree that feedback was really weird especially considering it was for '1 gram coke' which he has a huge price of like 33btc :? If he were doing such a large order why post saying 'not to be trusted , proceed with caution' It was vague feedback that didn't say whether he had received/not received or just had plain bad service.
    <br/>
    Most unusual.
    <br/>
    As for KIWIMAN in general , I wouldn't touch him with a barge pole between his strange above street level prices and his overt use of capitol letters it just screams bad vendor.. hell maybe even LE with the intent of busting/scaring a few good ol kiwi buyers!
    <br/>
    Until he shows himself on the forums to show at least a little legitimacy I would urge caution when purchasing from him.

    I have no doubt in my mind that kiwiman is a conman.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some unlucky soul posted that he got scammed $500 squids from him, no replying to messages. Demanding quick FE etc etc.
    <br/>
    Plus if you read his profile, his over use of capital letters is bad form but what bothers me the most is, that I don't even think he is a NZer.
    <br/>
    He says "HEY KIWIS" and goes on to say "EVERYTHING WE THINK NEW ZEALAND WILL WANT".
    <br/>
    I think hes just plugging the market gap here and capitalizing on the fact we have no vendors.

    It might be a little late (50 posts is a hassle), but I have dealt with kiwiman, ordered 5 tabs round new years.  He made a listing of 5 on request.  After payment he asked me to resend the address, odd since it wasn't encrypted the first time.  They arrived promptly, discrete enough packaging for domestic.  Friend and I took one each, had a fantastic trip.
    <br/>
    Edit: Ehrlich test didn't do much, used 1/5th of blotter, ended up a very light pink, and the blotter went white so it was probably the ink.  Ah well I'm picking vendors more carefully now.

    guys be wary of a new vendor TakeAction that has popped up in NZ. A week ago he was trying to sell in Australia and is now pretending he moved over to NZ.

     Thanks ladyjane good lookin' out, thought I'd spread the word myself but you beat me to it. I've reported this vendor multiple times for the initial scam attempt, trying to sell his account OOE and now this even more pathetic attempt, but to no avail. If you touch this vendor you will be burned.

     And a side-note, we need a NZ vendor shipping salvia over here!

    Hello fellow Kiwis,

    <br/>
    Im about to start listing small amounts of ice. So far I have sent 8 half grams packs with 100% success.
    <br/>
    Before I even bother I would like some feedback as to weather anyone cares for this service?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My sister told me that current price per gram is 850. I aint going to charge near that amount of course.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts? I have 10 samples.

       guys be wary of a new vendor TakeAction that has popped up in NZ. A week ago he was trying to sell in Australia and is now pretending he moved over to NZ. He was a scammer, he likely had a scam account before this one called BrisbaneNextDay. TA is already asking for FE even though he has no transactions under his belt. Be careful and don't be the first person to FE.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He tried to list his Vendor Account for sale due to everyone calling him out as a scammer and it is possible the account has changed hands, but unlikely. In his last scam he made people FE and never sent anything.

      Thanks ladyjane good lookin' out, thought I'd spread the word myself but you beat me to it. I've reported this vendor multiple times for the initial scam attempt, trying to sell his account OOE and now this even more pathetic attempt, but to no avail. If you touch this vendor you will be burned.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And a side-note, we need a NZ vendor shipping salvia over here!

    Fuck it's been a while since I've posted here amongst the fellow kiwis.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh, yes, did I see people talking about salvia? Haha. I've got about 3 or 4 ounces of the plain leaf that I grew myself last year dried out, and it's really strong, I just smoked the plain leaf on it's own, and got really fucked up. It's not my cup of tea at all though so I'd love to get rid of it, it's just sitting around. Any kiwis interested in buying dried salvia leaf? natural and organic too, the way I grow all my plants. Don't know if it would really be worth purchasing a vendor account just to get rid of it though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeaa, that TakeAction guy always seemed really fucking dodgy to me, and now he's pulled his listings or has gone stealth or something aye. He's a scammer, for sure. He had bad feedback, someone said they never recieved their domestic order. I actually messaged him to ask about any other drugs, particularly opiates, and he was very keen to tell me all about this golden triangle #4 asian heroin he has, and that it's very special and he will make a special custom stealth listing just for me blah blah. What really made me certain to be able to call him a scammer was when he was talking with me about the listing and he then decided it would be best if I paid him directly, out of silk road completely - from my bank account to his bank account, and that he'd send it to me after he get's my payment. Lol what the fuck, how stupid does he think I would be? I don't think ANYONE on here would fall for that shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It finally seems we MAY have a legit solid vendor in NZ for H, this "Nodnow". Gonna see how he goes and possibly try him out. Anyone here have experience with him or talked to him? He's pretty new

    I can personally vouch for Countdown, he's an awesome dude, and I've placed multiple orders with him now and there has never been a problem at all. Very friendly and is very strong on customer service which is what it's all about. Thanks alot man  ;) Please hang around, we need solid reliable vendors like you here! You should also look into more products aswell  :D

    <br/>
    also wanted to let you all know there is a new bitcoin trading site coming soon Someone i Know is launching it they are in closed beta atm we were using bitnz dot com but they take fking ages to process orders and the dude randomly disapears outta the country takes like 2 weeks to process sht
    <br/>
    so my friend is launching bitnz dot co dot nz hes been working for months on the security aspect
    <br/>
    and everything will be fully automatic so no need to wait days for clearance etc
    <br/>
    also hes tryna include paypal etc for those annoying transactions where u dont wanna go into a bank etc
    <br/>
    if you like the idea throw me a +1 if there is anything you would like to see encorporated into the site lemme know also he is gunna give out some commision for people promoting the site so if your a vendor and you wanna chuck us up a recomendation on your profile if someone uses your refference u will make a small % of there order :)
