    <br/>
    <br/>
    it did not get sent (more likely)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it got stopped (less likely as its domestic?)

    PM the vendor, be polite.  Ask them nicely to confirm the product was sent and if there is a DCN for tracking, could you please get it.  If they do not wish to give you the DCN, and they say it was sent, ask them to at least look up the tracking and tell you what the tracking says.

    <br/>
    It is not unknown for express mail to be delayed for one reason or another.  It could have been misplaced or ended up on the wrong truck, which takes time to be corrected as the package has to be re-routed so it can be delivered to the correct address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the vendor doesn't return your PM all you can do is wait until resolution is available for the order and then request a refund.

    Just as an informational aside.....If seven days have passed since an expected Express package never showed ..it very well could be too late to do anything about it.  When  Expressmail doesn't make it's guaranteed delivery and there's no  information available to you why..you should immediately take action  to try and track it down.  The longer you wait to find something that is missing the less chance you have of locating it.  Expressmail rarely ever gets permanently lost or goes unaccounted but it does happen.  The place to start is with the zip code of the last known scan.   That zip code will usually be the location of a sort facility.  Find the local phone number of that facility and call.  Most sorting centers have an Express Mail Office Supervisor so that's who you want to speak with...otherwise any Supervisor who was on duty at the time and day your missing pkg was scanned.  You'll find most Supervisors to be quite helpful especially when  it comes to missing Express mail.  Peoople in charge generally are motivated to locate something that went missing on THEIR watch.
