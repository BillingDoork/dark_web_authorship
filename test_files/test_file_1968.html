    Enough is enough.  Virtually nobody can come up with a seizure letter but they all want free drugs.  I have been shipping globally for 15 months now and without a doubt I've found more blatant scammers here on Silk Road than on Black Market Reloaded and bitcointalk.org.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My sincerest apologies to those Australian customers who have been honest, kind, and respectful in all of their dealings with me.  Some of my very favorite customers are Australian and I wish there was a better way, but I'm not a masochist and you can only beat me over the head 30 or 40 times before I get the message.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The straw that broke the camels back has been multiple "customers" who place an order that is large enough to get divided into 3-5 envelopes, and guess what?  Not a single one arrives, and not a single seizure letter reaches them either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe there are vendors here in Silk Road that are this incredibly stupid, but I assure you that I am not one of them.  With 100% positive feedback on Black Market Reloaded, 100% positive feedback here on Silk Road, and an overwhelmingly positive feedback profile in bitcointalk.org that goes back over 15 months I think it is reasoable to expect that I am upholding my part of the transaction.

    :( I can't tell if my fellow ozzies are dogs, or if we're just incredibly unlucky with our situation.
    <br/>
    Our customs aren't even that bad, except in the past 3 months or so, some people have noticed them getting tougher, or we're getting selectively scammed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Love letters aren't sent out that much any more I believe, which is wrong.
    <br/>
    I am not sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This sucks, hope the trend doesn't continue.
    <br/>
    I've never had any problems, but I only order from the best packagers.

    Don't know why you post this info here and not on your sr vendors page.??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway I never had any trouble receiving anything. Maybe at moment there might be
    <br/>
    a little more seizures due to all the publicity etc but that will blow over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But mainly I believe it's the vendors that are being lazy sending crappy made parcels.
    <br/>
    And of course with whistle blowers like your self come more vendor that scam! using "The old Aus Customs Story" while they don't send
    <br/>
    out any product after they make ozzies FE ??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To avoid this just only send parcels with tracking and both keep the number, this way both parties can actually correctly tell
    <br/>
    if its being stopped by customs or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mate we're dealing contraband here it illegal as you know and sometime thing get confiscated but 90% of the time
    <br/>
    it does not. I'm sure you calculated this in with your pricing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Conclusion : stop  :'( start dealing  8)

    I have never heard of Aust Customs sending a seizure notice but I have so far have had successful deliveries. You say scamming Australians. If a package does not arrive to me, I would say scamming vendor or at least very little effort of stealth enough to get through. In a short amount of time, this site has gone from a dream for me to being very shady due to the mass amount of packages not turning up in general to Aust.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think that more and more vendors are selectively scamming ozzies and using the "Customs are awesome there" as a bullshit excuse. Not saying that you do this, as you may have just been in contact with some dodgy people from Australia, but we are not all that bad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a side note, there has been massive media coverage in Aust recently about SR so I would guess there is a large influx of people who have just found this site. Read into that what you will.

    Although it is possible some vendors maybe discriminately scamming AUS customers, because of their customs history, it is more likely an issue with both parties, as the package couldve been sent. In this case, the vendor knows it was dispatched and perceives the buyer as a scammer or liar. If dispatched and not received, without any proof of a seizure, this makes the buyer think the vendor scammed them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The simple solution, as stated before me is to only use tracked/registered mail when shipping to certain strict countries (such as AUS). If they don't want to pay the new, higher shipping prices, well that's just too bad, because others may have spoiled it, or customs left the vendor with no choice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sympathetically, as a Canadian, I think we should work with the Australian community here by encouraging buyers to rate packages sent to them, privately with the sellers, and also in a dedicated forum thread. First off, It seems a great degree of stealth should be employed when exporting to AUS, as many packages are opened due to suspicions. The Australian buyers should begin setting guideline to ship to your country. You will likely be charged a premium for stealth shipping, but at least ur keeping the products available to your fellow aussies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be a shame for certain countries to be embargoed by a large amount of sellers due to reasons that can be worked around.

    Regicide, I agree that it is beneficial for both parties to work through any issues, although I am still doubtful that Aust Customs is all that is cracked up to be. Some people seem to think customs has upgraded to x-ray psychic radar super sniffing robots which will identify a package before a plane has landed.
    <br/>
    I am of the belief that Customs are overworked, underpaid people who do the best they can with the sheer amount of mail coming through and have little success. If they were more successful, they would be holding press conferences every other day congratulating themselves asking for more funding to stop the unstoppable.
    <br/>
    Although I have no idea of the number of Australians using SR, I am sure that a few trusted vendors will come out of the woodwork who have a high success rate and will make an absolute killing. I could name a couple already who are known and trusted but the Aust buyers here, but that would be daft.

    This is simply solved by dealing in only sending orders with tracking. Protects both parties.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If an Aussie doesn't wanna have tracking or sign for the package then don't order, simple.

    At least doing it this way hopefully would result in a much better end result of what the hell actually happens to packages that are sent out.

    absolutely not. if that became an un/official rule here, then the afp and customs would have a much narrower stream of packages to check and almost all would be intercepted.

    Even if I FE'd so the onus was on me, I'd prefer not to get a tracked parcel. That's one additional, dangerous touchpoint that can be avoided.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no doubt the scamming works both ways, but sadly I have absolutely no doubt it's heavily weighted to us Aussies doing most of it. Greed does sad things to people.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pity they don't look at the bigger picture; we're a small market, sellers don't need the hassle or the risk, so they will shut us out.

    The past couple of months here on the road, i've noticed the general mood and attitude to, and of AU becoming bleaker.  No coke without FE, few trustworthy vendors for it.  Even quality trusted vendors for psychedelics/mdma who we can all count on, still require FE.  I've also had my second (of only 2 total over 8 months) mishap over the last few weeks, and am more anxious lately of the possibility of another one happening again soon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Makes me a bit scared.  Part of this is the old anxiety of ordering from SR, so far it ebbs and flows between anxiety and joy, but lately, it seems more full of anxiety while I try and stash what I can, because as I feared, time could be running out.  I don't want to fear this though, as my desire to take drugs is closer to my heart than my desire to follow useless drug prohibition laws that only serve to punish innocent, responsible people.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the Australian buyers who purposely scam ANYONE,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    fuck off! Don't ruin it for us!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And vendors, as a collective, I have to suck up to you a little more than the scumbag aussie scammers, but please, don't scam us!

    Something is definitely going on with Australian customs at the moment.
    <br/>
    I have been a long time buyer on Silk Road, with very few lost packages.
    <br/>
    However, in the last couple of months I have not received any of my three orders from Europe.
    <br/>
    Two were from respected vendors who I have dealt with many times before.

    TrailerTrash I've always enjoyed your posts so if I have to pick one out of the thread to comment on then I guess you win the prize.  Yes, I did brag very openly.  And I still do.  I can not be profiled.  Customers who have received multiple orders from me know this.  The envelope sizes are never the same.  Paper?  Plastic?  Tyvek?  Never the same.  Return address?  Very, very few are used before a fresh one is implemented.  Label sizes? Perpetually cycling from small to medium to big, from black and white to color,  from NGO addresses to corporate addresses to office towers and small real estate or travel offices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can not be profiled.  Not in Australia, and not anywhere else.  And when I was bragging about being 100% to Australia, I was.  And now I have a grand total of THREE seizure letters from down under.  So you scamming Aussies that say they don't send them- you're bullshit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I regularly hear Aussies bitching about paying $3 to $5 for 10mg Body Research Dianabol hearts.  Well, I guess you are getting what you deserve.

    Are all your letters shipped from Thailand?

    <br/>
    Customs are probably strict on letters from Thailand (same as the Netherlands, probably), this would result in alot of seizures.

    If the product is illegal and it's an amount that isn't worth following up on, then usually it's just thrown in the bin.

    Well, you've agitated me enough to finally make an account to post.    Fuck you mate.  Australian customs have obviously been cracking down over the last few months.  I've had 50+ packages come through without incident over the past year but in the last few months I've lost at least 10.  And guess what? NO FUCKING SEIZURE NOTICES.   They don't send them.  I've never bought from you but from what I can see you send from Thailand.  Let me assure you that all mail coming from Thailand is more heavily scrutinized than UK, US etc just like the Netherlands (lost many packages from there recently).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can't say that because your customer didn't get a seizure notice that they are scammers.   They just don't send them!  Yes there may have been one or two that popped up on the forums a couple of months ago but I sure as hell haven't had one sent to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australian's are not scamming.  Customs is cracking down big time so if you can't keep up with packaging/sending from a safer country then that's your fault.

    I think you have misread the Aust SR community Flaxceed. I dare say we are grateful for this site which offers such high quality gear at a fraction of the street price. There is nothing more I like doing than hitting the finalize button then go browsing to what I want next.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There seems to have been a lot of issues in the last month from what I am reading on the forums. Buyers blame the vendors, Vendors blame the buyers and nobody is happy. The more I think about it, the more I think there may be a 3rd answer rather than a scam buyer/vendor. Who is to say that customs have not profiled packages and are scrutinizing all incoming mail and generally making a concerted effort to crack down on drugs in the mail? There has been a lot of media coverage about SR, and I think that is a lot more believable than calling out a whole country as being scammers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I make an assumption here, and say that the buyers you are selling to have decent stats? But then overnight, they all turn into scammers? Complete nonsense. Even with new buyers, you would expect a large number of them to be genuine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like I said, Australians think SR is a godsend due to quality and price and people are more than happy to pay the "nominal" fee compared to the street.

    OK let me clarify my points a little now that I am working things out as best I can.  I've traveled the world a bit, and met a lot of Australians.  They are a good, fun lot.  They are also the ones to be offering some smoke one hell of a lot more often than begging for one!  As a group, they like a party and and are pretty giving souls.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But let me make another point.  Yes, I deal with people with no feedback, some good feedback, and just mediocre feedback.  It is always curious to me when I start with an Aussie who has NO feedback and he gets his first order no problem, then his second, third, fourth, etc- and all is good.  Then a guy with a bunch of good transactions places a great big order- expensive- lots of shit- and it gets split up into 3 or 4 manageable parcels.  And guess what?  Not a single one appears.  Selective scammer?  Well, there's no customs letters.  Is 500 Dianabols just tossed into the trash with no paperwork done?  500 Xanax, same thing?  And in the meantime I have others getting their parcels down in Australia just fine- some bigger, some smaller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Germany has decent customs too.  So does New Zealand.  And yet not a single package as gone missing to those countries.  Never, ever had a single parcel to Canada go missing either.  This is 15 months of shipping and thousands and thousands of packages.  This is bitcointalk.org, black market reloaded, and then in the last 2 months Silk Road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never had a parcel go missing to Finland.  Never to the UK.  It's interesting to see the people on this thread say "well, your packaging is just shit" because my ratio of seizures to successful deliveries is superb.  It is not top 1/4% yet, but I have customers who give me feedback regularly and I read these forums and I will never stop improving.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it is a real possibility that Australian customs is deliberately fucking up the program by throwing out parcels with contraband.  It sure would be an easy way to give us fits.  If this is true- forget whether you think it is or not for the moment- how is this best combated?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As has been noted, I announced that I was fucking Australian customs right in the ass.  Like any good rape, I need to re-hydrate, grab a grilled chicken sandwich, and then get right back at Michael Carmody's asshole.  He really loves the studded condoms by the way.  He's gonna hate the things that are coming next though!!!!

    Fuck yeah, lets forget about blame for the moment and concentrate on wtf is going on. You have been around a while, have you noticed the orders go missing recently ie last 4-6wks? I have noticed that there is a lot of talk about things not getting through recently.
    <br/>
    I have always maintained that Aust customs is no better than anywhere else, but with all the missing packages I could be wrong. There will be scams, but scamming on such a large scale is unlikely so the obvious is to look at customs.

    Flax, that's very interesting, of course only speculation through the interpretation of yourself, I'd rather see the data myself but that's not possible.

    Aussie buyer chiming in here....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had 3 packages arrive earlier in the year, but this month I didnt receive an order from one of SR's best rated sellers.
    <br/>
    No letter from customs, nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Paranoia sets in on both sides, the seller might think I am scamming him, I might think he selectively scams australians.... but through back &amp; forth private messages, I am confident we both proved to each other that we are both honest and that the problem was with customs.
    <br/>
    It is in my best interest to build a strong relationship with the top sellers as I am here for the long term. But with all the media coverage in aus recently, SR has had a huge influx of children.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know it can be very time consuming to chat with new customers, however it makes sense to me that a seller should get to know who they are selling to, at least a little. It is pretty easy to tell if someone just found there way here from a T.V report, judging by the forums there are HUNDREDS of australian teenagers on here, many I would flatly refuse to do business with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Gauge there maturity and intelligence, be friendly! I would not dare scam any vendor I have purchased from.... they are all such friendly and courteous people :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my 2c, take it or leave it, but don't lose faith in us aussies....  we aint all bad! :)

    This seems to me like it would be a natural consequence of countermeasures that the government implements via the post offices.  They are not fighting us directly; they are fighting our will to do business with each other.  If this is a simple as making a quick policy change to no longer send love letters, that's a very low cost, extremely high reward move to make.  If their experiment works it will spread like wildfire around the postal systems of the world.  We have technology on our side, and they have their understanding of human weakness, and here we are.

    Sure seems simple enough to me, if there is no letter, then there is no reship.

    I am in oz and awaiting an order, but I am not going to demand a reship from the seller if I have no way to prove I did not receive it.

    Shit happens, the order may yet arrive, however after reading this thread and customs little games this month I do not hold out much hope, I would not hold the vendor responsible for it tho.

    Personally I have ordered from flax before and found all levels of service to be really good, and hope that the actual scammers out there have not spoiled it for the rest of us.

    How do we know? As in if we don't get a letter, how do we know customs got it? That said, I've always been very surprised by the thought that customs would send you a letter saying "we found something illegal being sent to you, don't do it again".

    The shipping time thing can be put down to *so* many factors, I'm not even going to go there because I need to pass out.
    <br/>
    How do we know if our drugs were shipped? We don't! It's fucking terrible, always get a DCN if you can, I always do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really wish they did send them out more again.
    <br/>
    I am not sure why they stopped doing it so much, I'd love some insider info... I can only speculate.
    <br/>
    I could be wrong, I don't think I am, but I am open to being wrong. Someone prove it, I can't prove anything.

    I honestly can't get my head around scammers, i mean seriously.. SR is such an amazing system! you've got a selection of every drug possible, high quality.. why take it so for granted?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i've probably made a dozen orders of various things to the land down under, the few things that haven't arrived i believe weren't even sent in the first place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Skyy made me finalize early, big mistake. I thought just cause he was the #1 seller it would be all fine and sweet.. but it wasn't.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF anyone can take anything from this message, please just respect the system and don't rip people off! if you get your goods make sure you release the funds.. think of how good SR actually is, it's bloody brilliant! you punks who just wanna get some free drugs ruin the whole fucking thing for the majority of us.

    I am not taking this lightly and the last thing I want to do is stop selling my products where they are illegal- especially in places like Australia that go after them like they are heroin, meth, and machine guns.  Prohibition is not effective and it makes the criminals rich and the consumers drunk.  The governments of the world are losing the war on drugs and they are losing it very badly.  In Mexico now we have sometimes 20, sometimes 50 human beings with their heads cut off and their arms and legs severed.  Just in case there is any misunderstanding by the governments- that's a loss.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is my new procedure for Australians.  Place your order.  Don't place a large order if you don't have a FLAWLESS history with me.  Next, immediately send a message to me explaining who you are, if you have ordered before, and you will want to comment on your stats if they are questionable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take a page out of Eddie Dean's playbook.  Read his post above.  He wouldn't dream of asking for a re-ship or a refund without a seizure letter.  And guess what?  Eddie wouldn't even have to ask and I would re-ship to him in a heartbeat.  Why?  Because he has integrity and he is kind and friendly.  He has a good sense of right and wrong, of what is OK to ask for and what is not OK.  A lot of these things come with experience in life, so if you are 18 years old certainly you will not have the same interpersonal skills as Eddie and you will not do as well with me.  But use a little bit of common sense- it can go a very long way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And another thing that REALLY grates on me if you want to avoid my shit list.  When a seller has stats like this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    flaxceed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    send a message
    <br/>
    <br/>
    has been a member for 4 months
    <br/>
    was last seen: today
    <br/>
    ranked in the top 19% of sellers with 100% positive feedback from 213 transactions
    <br/>
    has 142 fans - become a fan
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...get in touch with me so we can work something out instead of taking the case into resolution and badmouthing me to death at every step.  I have this one fuckstick claiming he had the perfect mailbox that had received tons of parcels from the Netherlands with no problems and then mine came along and the packaging was so bad they opened it and his address is now ruined.  Yeah, maybe so- except nobody else talks shit on my packaging and probably with all the shit he had been importing from the Netherlands his box was under surveilance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess that is one of the keys if you want to do business with me, especially if you from Australia where packaging and shipping are more of a challenge- don't be a fuckstick.  The world has enough fucksticks as it is so if you could reform even a tiny bit, be a little more polite, and ask in a friendly manner, you stand a great chance of getting our very best service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as our latest packaging, we continue to get smaller and flatter.  We continue to vary the materials, colors, labeling methods, and also the post offices from which we ship.  We also have stealth-beyond-stealth that is only on special request.  I can't discuss that here.  Let's just say there are numerous distractions in the event that customs opens the parcel.  OK, I will reveal one of the many hundreds of decoys.  There are 5x7 glossies of Julia Gillard shaving her pussy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OK, Australia, let's try this again.  Remember if you place an order also send me a PM and give me some info on your stats or lack thereof, and let me know if you have any pics of Julia Gillard being double penetrated by black men.  Bonus for no condoms and cumshots on her face.

    Longtimer what do you (and others) think if shipping every package with tracking?  The elves and I fight about this  regularly because I have heard registered parcels/envelopes are searched more.  But I would love to be wrong and send every single one registered and get rid  of 90% of my headaches.

    The worry of searching ain't the issue for me, it's the more substantial paper trail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My very first SR order didn't show, but i recognised instantly that both sides were taking a risk; not sure why the seller should have to wear all the costs, so couldn't imagine asking for a reship; both sides, without discussion, both came up with what we felt was fair; half price on the next order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, I was confident he was a legit seller and he was sure I wasn't screwing him. Gut feeling for me is rarely wrong. But IMHO he held up his end of the bargain, we both know the risks and know there's customs in between. It's got to be buyer beware; hopefully with some decency from the seller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the thought (and I'm sure it happens) that buyers are scammers really pisses me off.

    Shame if you are being scammed by Aus people, I certainly know of people (not on SR) who are happy to screw over others they don't know if they think they have lost something from elsewhere. It is a poor attitude. I'm in Aus and have had loads of perfect transactions both locally and from OS, but I too have noticed in the last few months several have not shown up, and I have never received a letter from customs for a SR shipment. I've reached the point where I am holding off ordering from OS without tracking because I don't want a row of not received, would look bad on my profile. Restricts me somewhat, but its best for me and for sellers who I don't want to see lose their goods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Problem has been touched on, if there have been changes to customs policies we don't seem to know what they are. Its impossible to know full stats and see if customs are getting ahead of SR in Aus or just grabbing a slightly higher percentage, but either way we are definitely going to have to be a bit more careful in dealings.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Flaxceed, I've not dealt with you personally myself but for what its worth, sorry to see you shutting down Aus sales, but also very pleasing to see you actively looking for a way to improve things. Honesty is super important in this community and I wish there was an easier way to weed out scammers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for you shipping everything with tracking, I have always assumed that tracked (and especially express mail) don't get looked at as closely because they usually look more professional. However, I could be wrong there. Maybe add that to your variables; some tracked, others not?

    Good call Arutha- we are now giving the option of registered mail to customers who ask about it.  Above all else we want to communicate when we don't have much business history yet.

    AUSTRALIA- we are back if you make an effort to communicate.  If you place and order and you stats are 37/10 and I write a note to you and ask if you are willing to FE and you don't FE and don't write back-- I am left wondering how stupid a person could be.  This is a true story with true numbers- will the customer please come forward on this thread and explain that you just mainlined some really great smack and just didn't understand the requirements?  I am not your high school teacher- being stoned is a legitimate excuse in my book.

    Never received a single love letter. Also I still use the same address and get packages every week, so maybe I was getting selectively scammed by the vendors. But who really knows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only letter I've received from customs was when a tobacco order from 'Only' was intercepted requesting me to pay the tax on the cigs. FUCK THAT.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think tracking is essential, especially for larger orders $500-600+ I'm willing to take the risk of signing, a lot of people are not, I know this. But packages can still be sent with tracking and without having to be signed for and at least the vendor can see if customs nabbed it or if it was delivered and the buyer is trying to scam them. Also the buyer is also able to be sure it was sent in the first place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also FUCK FE, I've probably lost around $1500 from FE. And to very reputable members VMM, Tony76, Mrfungi with (95-100) and 300+ transactions. Never ever FE, especially for reputable members, because they're most likely pulling the old FE so I can keep the supply running scam just before bailing with a fat wad of cash.

    80 a month says nothing really. If its 80 out of 100, thats very bad news. If its 80 out of 10,000 thats really not so bad. Also be aware that not all posted busts come from SR, they can really only be guessing or assuming there. Apparently a huge amount of people who go to Amsterdam try to post themselves drugs. I also talked to someone who worked in Aus Post last year (posted details in another thread at the time) and they said a large amount of weed is grabbed because the package smells strongly or in some cases is so badly packed that its visible, any half respectable seller on SR vac seals and takes measures to disguise product so a lot of that must come from random people rather than SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Absolutely there has been more of a crackdown and more attention lately so we do need to be more careful, but the media also wants to paint the picture that police are on top of the issue, which is false.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @flaxceed, that is a generous offer and fantastic to see you come to that conclusion after the original post of the thread. You strike me as a great seller, I'll have to look at what you are offering and see if I can support you by buying something.

    Uhhhhhhh- not sure I would be boasting 80 SR busts a month.  Surely there are single dealers on SR who send more than 80 parcels to Australia in a WEEK.  And sure, maybe the government will pour a ton of people and money on this problem for a tiny return.  And then we will get some knocks on the doors, and there will be some prosecutions for a gram or two of meth or an oz of weed or some benzos.  Big-FAT-Fucking deal.  You are bailing water from your sinking ship with a teaspoon.  Quick, lieutenant, grab three more men with teaspoons!  No, no- wait- let's get TEN men and give each of them a soup ladel!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah, I'm pretty sure that boat will be back on keel any second now.  Look at prohibition in America in the 1930's.  Prohibition is the best way to give criminals the opportunity to gain unlimited cash and firepower.  The war on drugs between the states and Mexico is exactly the same idiotic, failed policy all over again.  Every dollar spent to fight SR and the new digitized commerce of illicit substances will produce a thousand-fold increase in illicit profits in the hands of the suppliers and marketplace entrepreneurs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With a crippled global economy thanks to our benevolent politicians lining their pockets with "free-trade deals" that sold out jobs and sold out working men and women, why the hell would you not sell drugs?  Everyone in Europe and America and all the other failing economies around the world should be lined up to do everything they can to create electronic, illicit commerce.  Taxes are the water that feeds the plant.  Kill it.  Dry it up, and kill it.  Tell everyone you know about bitcoin, and tell every drug user you know about silk road.  Ask to pay with bitcoins, and offer to pay for services and goods in every part of your life with bitcoins.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it worth the risk?  Well, do you want to live a slave, or die free?  Who are you at your core?

    This thread reminds me of a thought I've had a thousand and one times after finding an empty mailbox - wouldn't it be great if someone was running a very simple service that operated as so:
    <br/>
    -in touch with one very trustworthy, reliable person from each first-world country, or at least the US and UK
    <br/>
    -each of these people is paid to send one envelope each day containing a slip of paper with a number and country identifier on it
    <br/>
    -very quickly a huge amount of data is collected, more than enough to smooth out the outliers that fuck everything up when you're only ordering a few packages a month
    <br/>
    -data is graphed by country and published somewhere online with weekly updates, so we can once and for all have a solid idea of what we should be expecting
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be very cheap and fairly easy, I know I'd donate to such a service. Another cheaper and even more comprehensive way would be somehow crawling all the tracking pages of Auspost and using a script to find the time between sending and receiving for each piece of mail, then dropping it all into a spreadsheet and graphing by originating country vs. time, it could even be broken down city by city... too bad I wouldn't even know where to start, haha.

     Enough is enough.  Virtually nobody can come up with a seizure letter but they all want free drugs.  I have been shipping globally for 15 months now and without a doubt I've found more blatant scammers here on Silk Road than on Black Market Reloaded and bitcointalk.org.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My sincerest apologies to those Australian customers who have been honest, kind, and respectful in all of their dealings with me.  Some of my very favorite customers are Australian and I wish there was a better way, but I'm not a masochist and you can only beat me over the head 30 or 40 times before I get the message.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The straw that broke the camels back has been multiple "customers" who place an order that is large enough to get divided into 3-5 envelopes, and guess what?  Not a single one arrives, and not a single seizure letter reaches them either.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Maybe there are vendors here in Silk Road that are this incredibly stupid, but I assure you that I am not one of them.  With 100% positive feedback on Black Market Reloaded, 100% positive feedback here on Silk Road, and an overwhelmingly positive feedback profile in bitcointalk.org that goes back over 15 months I think it is reasoable to expect that I am upholding my part of the transaction.

    Ok where here is my experience from using SR over a year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The last 2 months my "friend" had a bunch of packages not come through and he got raided by Australian state police (I wont mention which state).. but they took his laptop. Coke, Pills and weed didn'te turn up over a period and Australian Customs had a list of every package that had come through. They charged him with "Intent to posses". He is fighting it with a lawyer so I dont know the outcome. He never received a love letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know first hand another person who ordered a larger quantity of substance from UK (over simple possession limit) and he got a love letter asking to declare what it was (had unknown white substance on the letter) and to contact customs to pick it up. He told the vendor and the vendor reshipped without telling him and then he got a second one! He showed me it, I could prob get hold of it - but if you dont think it exists, you need to get your head out of your ass. They won't bother with eg under 2g but if you ordered like 5 etc, higher chance you will get one!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be honest, hearing this made me stop ordering, throw out my hdd as i've had a package not come lately from Budworx UK (30 days). Be warned that customs has tightened - my "friend" will most likely get out of it because it appears circumstantial but fuck that.

    I heard that Zyzz met Tim Sharkey in Thailand, they fell in love, and Zyzz faked his own death because he couldn't admit his sexuality to Chestbrah and the aesthetics crew.
    <br/>
    Zyzz and Tim Sharkey now live happily ever after in Pattaya.

    If he was being monitored that closely wouldn't they just let him receive the orders then bust him with possession?

    WTF? Relax everyone, this thread was fairly old and got bumped if you want to throw in an opinion you could at LEAST go and read the whole thread rather than just the first post. It concluded with flax deciding to continue shipping to Aus and start offering tracking, so pretty sure this thread is now pointless.

        Ok where here is my experience from using SR over a year.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The last 2 months my "friend" had a bunch of packages not come through and he got raided by Australian state police (I wont mention which state).. but they took his laptop. Coke, Pills and weed didn'te turn up over a period and Australian Customs had a list of every package that had come through. They charged him with "Intent to posses". He is fighting it with a lawyer so I dont know the outcome. He never received a love letter.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I know first hand another person who ordered a larger quantity of substance from UK (over simple possession limit) and he got a love letter asking to declare what it was (had unknown white substance on the letter) and to contact customs to pick it up. He told the vendor and the vendor reshipped without telling him and then he got a second one! He showed me it, I could prob get hold of it - but if you dont think it exists, you need to get your head out of your ass. They won't bother with eg under 2g but if you ordered like 5 etc, higher chance you will get one!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To be honest, hearing this made me stop ordering, throw out my hdd as i've had a package not come lately from Budworx UK (30 days). Be warned that customs has tightened - my "friend" will most likely get out of it because it appears circumstantial but fuck that.

    I'm a bit confused by this part it seems to imply a certain level of sophistication that is surprising. You're saying the guy got a bunch of stuff, which was obviously not tampered with or opened and re-sealed (otherwise he is an idiot for continuing), yet somehow customs knew what substance and weight was in each delivery?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or, his laptop coughed up a handy diary he was keeping that noted everything he had done, and they presented him back that information?

    My interpretation of his comments was whatever they seized they kept and logged to build a case against him / his drop point. They may have even let some suspicious packs through, possibly to keep the flow coming. It is conceivable that they could hang on to everything and if you were stupid enough to keep ordering to the same drop they finally make a move once they've got ounces and ounces of product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's just me theorizing out loud though. I wouldn't give a single shred of credit to his story. 99% of the time this information is totally wrong. I suspect many of these accounts are possibly even INTL vendors posting misinformation to supplement their selective scamming to Aus? (haha conspiracy theory to the max!). We've seen in the past shitty vendors claiming they have insider information that "Auspost is doing a week long blitz on express post, delays expected and possibly siezures!", when in reality it's just them making excused for being a shitty vendor.

    Well it's situational. If all of a sudden customs find some idiot is bringing ounce of coke all the time it's plausible they through some of the suspected packages so that same idiot keeps using the address. They could snag 1 in 3 and pretty quickly have enough to go bust open that address I'm sure. While I'd agree even if they did "build a case" a real conviction would be crazy hard to get if you had even a half decent lawyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Clearly, even that hypothetical situation requires #1: large amounts of drugs and #2 a complete fucking moron.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again though, just to state, these stories are never true. Be smart, be safe.

     Well it's situational. If all of a sudden customs find some idiot is bringing ounce of coke all the time it's plausible they through some of the suspected packages so that same idiot keeps using the address. They could snag 1 in 3 and pretty quickly have enough to go bust open that address I'm sure. While I'd agree even if they did "build a case" a real conviction would be crazy hard to get if you had even a half decent lawyer.

     Clearly, even that hypothetical situation requires #1: large amounts of drugs and #2 a complete fucking moron.

     Ok where here is my experience from using SR over a year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The last 2 months my "friend" had a bunch of packages not come through and he got raided by Australian state police (I wont mention which state).. but they took his laptop. Coke, Pills and weed didn'te turn up over a period and Australian Customs had a list of every package that had come through. They charged him with "Intent to posses". He is fighting it with a lawyer so I dont know the outcome. He never received a love letter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I know first hand another person who ordered a larger quantity of substance from UK (over simple possession limit) and he got a love letter asking to declare what it was (had unknown white substance on the letter) and to contact customs to pick it up. He told the vendor and the vendor reshipped without telling him and then he got a second one! He showed me it, I could prob get hold of it - but if you dont think it exists, you need to get your head out of your ass. They won't bother with eg under 2g but if you ordered like 5 etc, higher chance you will get one!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To be honest, hearing this made me stop ordering, throw out my hdd as i've had a package not come lately from Budworx UK (30 days). Be warned that customs has tightened - my "friend" will most likely get out of it because it appears circumstantial but fuck that.
