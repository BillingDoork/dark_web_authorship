    So i just moved into a new place, and I am about to do my first SR run through it, but I have noticed that the previous owner of the house (the house is now under my name) still get their mail delivered to the house (like newsletters and shit). So my question is, could I use their info to send it to my address and then just take it if it shows up? Or would it be safer to use my real name?

    I suspect I either would work. You have to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with either option. There's no reason to think that a letter addressed to the previous tenant wouldn't arrive, I'm sure, but there are some advantages to using your real name. It depends what you're ordering and how much. If you're just getting personal, who cares, do whatever and you'll be fine. if you're ordering hundreds or thousands worth, there are other factors in play.

    Yeah, I've been personally kind of wondering about this as well. I get stuff from the former owners(Before we owned it, almost 10 years ago I bet), and the last 4-5 tenants. I've got a few small packages/promo stuff, catalogs, and even letters from the state for pretty much all of them. Seemed like an interesting option but I'm nervous it would draw more attention getting a package for an old tenant. I legitimately shop online quite a bit(love free 2day lol) and receive FedEx/UPS/USPS weekly. I think it helps that my last name is the same as the one that's been on the utility bill for 10 years so it's plausible to think we are forwarding the mail ourselves, no? I've never done return to sender because we legitimately do know a few of the old tenants still so we actually try to forward the mail.

    I'd say send a couple test boxes or something and see what happens. Hopefully the person doesn't realize it and get mail forwarding. I've done ~20 or so successful(100%) transactions/$2k for personal amounts of a few things, so I'd hate to screw it up. I'd like to do a few larger orders myself, nothing to sell, just to minimize frequency of orders, so I'd like to kill as much risk as possible. I'm sure its technically still a "safe" amount(maybe 5-10g of MDMA), but I'm nervous haha.

    If the old-owners file an address change with the post office, any mail in their name directed to that addresses will be manually forwarded to their new address, meaning you won't get it.... this is assuming that they even file the address change with the USPS in the first place.

    Not all mail will carry to the new residence! Does the mail say "current resident" because if you put that on a letter it is not forwarded. Package like that would raise a suspicion.
