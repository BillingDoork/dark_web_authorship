    I ordered something from a vendor I've used twice now and it arrived in two days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is the third time and today was suppose to be the second day and nothing came in the mail :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have looked around and noticed that a few vendor noticed on their page that currently priority mails are taking 3 days instead for say you get it in two and express are taking two days for say you usually get it overnight.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just want some inputs please to get my mind off this and it's sort of stressing me out, I hope some people can let me know if they actually experienced this within this week or two.

    They do seem to be slow right now. Today was the 3rd day for a priority package for me and it's a no show. Never had anything take longer than 2 days from this particular vendor before.

    I got my package promptly and on time.  Maybe it's a local issue?  Or maybe a vendor problem.  Should be ok though.

    Mine is priority mail, this vendor (RoxiPal) I ordered from twice already. Both times got here in 2 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered this on Thursday and he even confirmed with me that I made it it in just before the cut-off of USPS to have it shipped same day. I am guessing he got the package out around 2-3 local time and was marked in transit the same day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope I get it tomorrow, he's reading my messages but not answering. He's always kept me up to date but being sketchy right now. Idk why he's reading my messages and not responding since he ALWAYS does. Good thing the Superbowl is today to keep my mind off things.

    Dont worry a lot of priority can take 3 days and policy states up to 5 days.  This was announced I believe that it would take longer after the new year.

    I understand, I really hope it shows up tomorrow I'll be sure to update.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    funny thing is an order earlier in January came on time in two days.
    <br/>
    I also had two packages from a different vendor last week one via priority in two days and one via first class in three days. Again this was just last week!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry to sound so dumb here, but I think you know the anxiety some ease of mind is good. I hope Roxipal will reply soon. He has the DCN but don't give them out, but he's always kept me up to date where it's at. He probably didn't want to disappoint me by sending a message on my birthday yesterday saying it wasn't going to arrive. Who knows  :-[

    I got a sample from the guy before. I'm still in escrow so I'm not really worried. I've had priority sent on Monday come on Saturday. I'm sure all the snow and rainstorms this weeks have slowed it down plus any other factors slowing shipping times.

    IMO these plants were probably useless and slow. Took a lot of profit away from them and used a lot of resources.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It makes no sense to have slower times, they would lose business from that prospective. They've changed "tracking" ways as I have been reading on this forum imo it'll probably be REAL tracking now instead of the DCN.

    What i love, is when you read the Tracking Number, it gives you a Estimated Delivery date.
    <br/>
    So far it has been 100% guarantee each time.

    And USPS is having like $3billion budget cut this year, this is gonna effect us somehow, i would think.

    Just an update don't know if I'm just lucky this week or if its a sign USPS may be getting their shit together (I know, I know they never will) but I have a couple of packs that came through on time and one priority arrived on time and the second one is showing its going to arrive tomorrow which will make it two days as well, for the record from mid december till now my priority packs were on average 3 business days with one taking 5 days (Fuckers) and a handful taking 4 business days. Hopefully things are speeding up but i'm not that hopeful and don't advise anyone else to get hopeful either.  Best of luck to everybody I think we'll need it from here on out with the supposed Post Office going flat broke by October

    My priority package arrived on Wednesday, took a full week to get to me, and it wasn't a long journey same coast. I was worried, but it seems to have been sitting at my local distribution for about 3 days.
