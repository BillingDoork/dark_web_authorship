    I've been receiving mail under a legitimate name to a legitimate address for a while, and since last week (around the time when my first SR shipment (blotters to said address)) could have arrived (though it would be on the fast side still) 2 domestic letters mailed from a short distance away have failed to arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This fact has me shitting myself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does this match any known LE patterns?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's hard to imagine it being a coincidence that BOTH of them don't show up. Maybe LE would be having the PO hold all of my mail or something due to my btc purchase or my shit being found...?

    this happened to me last month around Thanksgiving time. The post is just slow as shit right now due to all the holidays. I didn't get any type of mail at all for few day stretches, then all of a sudden I'd get a shitload of mail. Most of it just sits around at the post office when they have the day off and builds up. You're fine, everything should show up, it'll just take longer than usual :p

    Still I can't fucking take this. I wasn't cut out for it. If nothing shows today I'm just gonna mail my most important items overseas and go live in an internet cafe near an international port until my roommate gives me the all clear.

    i will repost a post i put in about regular mail and scamming give it a read and lmk if it sounds all to familual heere it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is an exact scam that is now run on me x2 ill explain how they run it aand how sr gives customer 75% refund and also a 1/5 feedback about regular mail
    <br/>
    <br/>
    customer orders from you this really only works in canada because we can not add tracking for $.75 to a letter mail. the only way to track is to send min of expedite parcel $7 lowest. to set it up you have to live in canada and order in canada. then have vendor send in regular mail. why because you can not track it. then a few days say 5 days in send it direct to sr resolution that you believe the vendor did not send your package and you know 100% for sure they can not prove it.. then sit back wait till it goes to resolution or keep messaging vendor to give you 100% refund. knowing it probably is a small order or they would of sent it tracked.blackmail them for a good feedback, and state you will have sr revoke their vendor site. whether that works or not you still piss off the vendor. keep doing till they fold because they do not want feedback fucked up. and yes it does fuck it uop even 1. as soon as you have less than 100% trust me , all your customers start to doubt you i don't care if they have been the most loyal. if you introduce doubt into anybody's mind about their order they will react. that reaction is like a snowball effect, rolling downhill, customers doubt more some complain some leave some don't do anything. but the big thing here is one person who does this exact method to every vendor will sent ripples through the whole sr community.
    <br/>
    MY first one was from repulse64, they did this exact scam, lets all guess what sr did with it.   i send all the conversations to them, 5 full pages i had to send it in 3 different parts it was so big. she played me like a fiddle. and trust me i don't care if your site is 1 day or 2 yrs old. it will happen to you and you will get the same result i did . not to mention when it is done they give you a 1/5 feedback. . sr gave them 75% refund. i asked for explanations they just said that is what we came up with.
    <br/>
    it does not matter what policy you have for refund or resend. if they complain that you did not send it, and to this point i had 100% feedback. then the snowball effect came and 2 others did the exact same thing. i wrote to sr stating you are saying that if we as vendors send regular mail in canada. they we can not prove we sent out and customer will geet their order from you, a refund from sr and leave you with a 1/5 feedback.
    <br/>
    THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU WE AS VENDORS NEED TO STOP IT

    Hm... I don't have reason to suspect I've been scammed or anything at this point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be clear, I'm talking about regular mail as in, legitimate actual non-drug domestic letters mailed from about 2km away which both went missing in the span of a week.

    LOL Calm down!!!! 1ST OFF LE cant fuck with your mail unless it triggers a dog , and then a postal inspector has to go through procedures , LE doesnt override the FEDERAL MAIL unless its actual drugs, and even if they found anything else its gonna be thrown away unless its a pound of something.. I got Drugs in my mail box almost everyday last week priority mail, but only 1 or 2 pieces of 1st class mail and one of my packages for a pill was sent reg mail, so its just slow cause of the fucked up season , USPS alone is bad by itself but add xtra to their Job for Holiday's and it Mine as well be delivered on a bicycle...CALM DOWN!!

    Although it is likely that I'm overreacting, keep in mind that not everyone here is lucky enough to enjoy living in a Western democracy with the rights you are mentioning.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some of us have to face the fact that when the powers that be want you to be fucked, you are fucked and there are no rights or plausible dependability to fall back on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I'm not only freaking out for legal reasons, but if mail stops arriving, I need to figure that out before my fucking massively expensive drugs suffer the same fate, but at the same time walking into the post office right now doesn't sound like a very appealing process.
