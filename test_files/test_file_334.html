    This should probably be posted in the security forum, but this subject seems to get brought up everywhere.
    <br/>
    Many people appear to have trouble deciding whether or not to use a real name, address, PO box, or combination. I personally use a box and home address but never a real name. The trick is to make it all look normal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you open a box why not send yourself letters or packages to different recipients right from the start to make it look like a regular thing. You might have to provide I.D. to open the box but just because one person opens it doesn't mean that others won't receive in it. They don't ask you questions like that when you open it and the postman dropping off the stuff most likely doesn't care too much about the faceless person they are dropping the mail off to. You could even professionally address letters/packages to a business, which gives more probable cause to have multiple recipients. Maybe even spend extra for the bigger box in order to look more legitimate. After you set the box up you most likely don't have to come face to face with any postal worker unless you live in podunk nowhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Home addresses. If your name is John Smith then go ahead and order a package as Jane Smith. This isn't going to raise any suspicion and in my opinion it's better to have another name on a package if it happens to get picked up by law enforcement. Whatever your situation is, try to use it to your advantage. I had been living with my girlfriend for about a year and when we broke up several months ago I decided to have packages mailed in her name or some variation of her name. Not suspicious at all, the mail just keeps coming.
    <br/>
    Unless you've lived in the same place for 10 years, have had the same mailman for that whole time, and have gone out of your way to get to know him, you shouldn't have too much trouble finding a somewhat legitimate way to have mail delivered to your home without using your real name.
    <br/>
    Also if you are still having junk mail sent to you from a previous tenant and are unsure if using their name will work, try sending yourself a priority mail envelope in their name and see if it comes through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know everyone has differing views on this subject, especially vendors who don't want packages returned to sender because some idiot decided to place their first order with a bunch of bullshit postage information; but if you just use your head you can find a way to get packages sent without using your own name. I'm a big proponent of not using my own name but I know that many feel the complete opposite. I've seen a lot of questions about this subject and even more one sentence argumentative answers on the subject. So I figured I would throw out my own two cents and somewhat try to put some logic behind it.
    <br/>
    I've actually never had to use everything that I've suggested but I tried to throw out everything that I could think of anyways. I have never had a package missed out on because of a fake name. It all comes down to being smart about what you are doing. Don't press your luck too far by placing several order per week for months at a time, pace yourself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone has any more suggestions for those that can't seem to figure out a safe way to get their orders placed then post em. Or if you you want to poke holes in some of my suggested methods then do that!

    What follows applies only to the US: I'm clueless about other countries, so don't think it's universal or anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ever heard "possession is nine tenths of the law?"  It applies here.  If a package gets flagged as suspicious they pull it from the normal mail stream and call for an officer with a dog to come and sniff it (apparently they really line it up with several other packages like in a line up, but you get the point).  If the dog says there's bad things in the package, they get a warrant and open it.  If they find drugs, one possibility is that they confiscate them and put a "your contraband has been seized, scumbag!" letter in its place before shipping it on its way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another possibility is that they execute a controlled delivery.  This means they get an officer, dress him up like a mail carrier, put a tracking device in the package and possibly a sensor that alerts when the package has been opened, and deliver the thing.  Then they come and get you; at the mailbox when you've got it in your hands maybe, 30 seconds after you open it in your house -- don't really know the details of that part, but however they do it, they come and get you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nobody really cares whose name is on the package.  It's in your possession.  It's your package.  Doesn't matter if you got it at the PO box, your house, or the North Pole.  You're their guy, and they're done; that's the whole point of a controlled delivery -- they can't arrest you before a prosecutor can show in court that you actually did something to be arrested for.  No way to prove you ordered it, but they can easily prove you were holding it.  If you're going to get out of being convicted for something like this, it'll probably be on a technicality.  Which actually isn't as hard as I thought before reading up on this when I came to SR... I mean it's tricky, but it's actually possible to walk away free.  Just not very common.  But the cases where people got off that I found definitely had nothing to do with using a different name than their own.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using a fake or altered name does very little other than raise one more red flag for them to take note of.  That's my opinion, anyway.

    If you are in a property that recives mail for ex-residents i suggest using their name to add playsible deniability. This works very well if you are on the UK and live in a student property.

    using the old tenants name is a bad idea imo
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there have been multiple reports of packages not arriving and commonly they used the previous resident. just because you receive mail for them does not mean you will receive your order. there is no period of time that mail forwarding stops working for important mail. the postman knows they moved and who lives there currently. if the package looks like anything important besides just junk mail they are supposed to return the mail to sender. so if it has delivery confirmation or tracking they will not deliver it if theyre doing their job
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and i personally think it is cowardly and wrong to use someone else's name on your package. you are framing them basically if the package was to be confiscated and they could end up in legal trouble. as mentioned if you accept the package this will not protect you - in fact could likely get you in more trouble because you will be guilty of felony mail fraud for taking someones mail and opening it potentially

    As a buyer, you do what you want. However, as a vendor who uses DCN on every package... if your shit says 'Delivered' I'm getting my money. If it says "Failed Delivery" because you were a fool and gave the wrong name/address/zipcode/whatever... Guess what? I'm getting my money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USE YOUR REAL NAME AND ADDRESS. Or a P.O. Box. Use other precautions to protect yourself. That is all.
