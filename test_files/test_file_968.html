    That's a very good question and one that I too am researching.  I'll post what I find if/should I find something worth reporting and definitely please do the same!

    The best way is paying cash for stamps.  That isn't as easy as click-n-ship.  Getting tracking without going to the counter is more difficult.  But it is the best way to do it anonymously.

    Absolutely.  They've even got a $5.60 stamp that covers the cost of a flat-rate priority mail envelope.  For the small box you something like $0.20 more (I can't remember exactly) so you just use a $5.60+$0.20 stamp or whatever.  Tracking in now included for free but you need to either bring it to the counter or get "label 400" tracking labels which they don't like to give out at the post office.

    If this works I'd definitely be willing to send you some free methylone for your help.

    Absolutely.  They should be well-stocked on the $5.60 stamps.  Technically you can use any stamps you want as long as it adds up to the proper postage.  They also have $1 and $5 stamps now.  They have $0.20 stamps, $0.10 stamps, etc.
