    I'm going to be buying a quantity of lab equipment and chemicals from a vendor on SR. Is it safe to send these to my house? I'm almost certain it is not but would just like to confirm. Where can i ship the stuff without any heat. I can't ship it to any of my friends houses either :(

    Personally i wouldnt. That means you will have precursors there also?

    <br/>
    If its domestic i dont see any problem.
    <br/>
    Overseas then i would not try it. Get caught with glassware and your screwed.

    It's not.

    <br/>
    With glassware you're probably better off stealing it from your local high-school science classrooms.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Glassware shipped to a house is a MAJOR red flag for LE.

    So what would you recommend? It's off the Silkroad not the clearnet so it's not like im being put on any DEA lists. I just want a lab up and running.

    Without wanting to sound like a jerk, I would recommend you put a lot more thought into this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure the glassware comes from SR, but who is the vendor? How do you know that the items haven't been identified and registered while in transit?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The safest way would be to have no-one but you know you have the glassware. How to do this? Go rob somewhere that has glassware, and of course, don't get caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Watch a few episodes of Breaking Bad, particularly first season. Take some notes, because he makes lots of mistakes that you would otherwise make. (On a side note, if Walter could get rid of that Jesse kid that's always landing him in trouble and sell off SR, he would be set for life).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem with what you're doing is it inverts the 'pyramid' of SR; the reason SR is successful is because LE don't have the resources to go after every dime-bag sold on here, and they can't trace a (good) vendor without going to serious length. You on the other hand are buying equipment for manufacture (and want it delivered at home, to boot). It's very easy for LE to either pose as a vendor of precursors or lab equipment, or pick up a single item in the post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And then DEA and a dozen other three letter agencies will be all over you.

    Alright I've looked into this further.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You're still in school [1], you want the equipment to make LSD [2], you don't have $150USD to start a vendor account [3], and you're trying to raise this (trivial) amount of money by selling data that's freely available on ThePirateBay (also comes via a torrent so not secure, even if the 12gb of data was secure in the first place) [3].
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You also almost certainly live at home with your parents [4] (who else goes shopping with counterfeit coupons at Wal-Mart with their brother?); and you don't have the cojones to stare down a Wal-Mart clerk [4] let alone shrug off the DEA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You're wasting everyone's time, and you're being stupid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't be stupid. Play Grand Theft Auto if you want to play gangster.

    I would have knocked Jesse off his perch a long time ago, around the time the strychnine came into play. Same with that jerk DEA brother-in-law and pain in the ass wife. Then I would have set up my 'eBay business'.  :P

    Yeah, that's exactly what LE think, when they check the package that has been sent to your house. And of course, they don't know nothing about what you need to synthesize a common drug like LSD.

    Chemistry at a private house, generally is. How many times have you seen a hobby chemistry set in someones house? I'll bet never. If I walked into someone's house and saw any sort of lab set up, I'd be suspicious as all hell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are you going to pass it of as? "I like to synthesize your own... Um..." or "I'm doing a school project, which requires me to mail order lab equipment and chemicals and set it up at home, just don't ask my teacher because he'll act like he doesn't know about it"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stupid thread from a stupid kid (OP, not SeriousChemistry). Go ahead, order all the equipment (by selling your PirateBay material haha) and precursors, hide it from mommy and daddy, and then tell all the kids at school how cool you are. Then attempt the synthesis, and fuck it up to the point where you kill yourself in the process or produce poison.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know I'm being harsh, and I'm sorry it has to be that way... But you need a reality check kid.

    FireHawk your right, his damn wife is so annoying. I dont mind Hank though, that shoot out he had with those mexican cartel bros/cousins was awesome.

    <br/>
    But back on subject.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah just grab an RV like walter and jesse did and go whiz up some stuff out in the desert.

    Lucky for them there were never any planes flying over head looking for chemical hazes.. ;)

    <br/>
    But seriously...

    <br/>
    If you wanted to start a lab, this is the last place i think you would want to ask.
    <br/>
    If it was me, i wouldnt tell a soul, not even my dog, i actually dont have a dog...but you get what i mean?

    Can you not get a furnace and some glass-blowing equipment and make your own?

    Even better start making glass ornaments (or bongs) and sell them as a business venture.
