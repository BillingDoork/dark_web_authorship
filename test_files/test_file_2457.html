    i would ask wherever you plan on renting if they will hold packages at the desk for you if they are too big
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if not you better get one that can at least hold the express envelopes and padded mailers that are about 9x12 just to be safe

    I don't use a PO box for SR stuff, but at my PO anyway they will hold packages that are too big to fit and just put a card in your box saying "Hey come get your package from the counter". They don't seem to mind if packages are too big, but if you get too much regular mail to fit in your box they start bitching at you to buy a bigger box or come pick up mail more often...just my experience.

    Both previous replies pretty much cover it! Not sure what else you plan on ordering, but 10g of MDMA from almost any overseas vendor will fit in a standard mailbox - which means it'll fit in the smallest PO box quite easily as well.

    I have a medium size one.  Can't remember the size, but it is just big enough to fit a priority mail envelope.  I've received twice there no problem.  Waiting on my third order which has taken a day long than usual so far.  However, vendor labeled in transit 30 minutes before cancel was available so I'm willing to bet he mailed it the next day or so.  Anyway, I've gotten some hash and some bud in the states.  I'd say for personal amounts a PO box is a solid option.  I use my real info too.
