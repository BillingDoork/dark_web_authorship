    Can't chime in on the success rate, but given the level of surveillance citizens have allowed the government to have I would guess slightly more envelopes are controlled by a human than in other countries. But the NL vendors are aware of this and take additional measures to make the package get through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am in a European country not known for it's level of surveillance, but keen on accuracy and being thorough. My two NL packages have made it no problem, both times in 48 hours, both very well packaged. (but a pain in the ass to consolidate all the product without losing some)

    People overplay the "Netherlands Factor" too much. The chance that any standard letter will be checked is extremely minimal to the point where it's basically the same as ordering from anywhere else. If you are getting shipped proper packages then yeah, it's a bigger risk but for small orders just go for it.
