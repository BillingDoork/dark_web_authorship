    Hey,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been waiting on a package from SE Asia (to the US) for almost a month now, and the tracking has shown it as "Inbound into customs" for three weeks.  No changes, nothing.  I'm just wondering when I should start getting nervous.  I've done lots of searching through the forums/google and I see posts by people in similar situations but their packages usually arrived in less than 10 days.  I can't find examples of anyone's package taking this long.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is not a huge amount of drugs--definitely only enough for personal use.  And from everything I've read, this vendor has some of the best stealth on SR (my first time ordering from him).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone experienced this before?  If so, for how long, and what happened in the end.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm probably being overly paranoid, but I wish this damn package would just show up so I can stop stressing about it.

    At this point I've written off the money as lost, and that is totally fine with me.  I would be happy to lose the money as long as they dont come knocking at my door.  It was a fairly small amount (1.5g of h) so hopefully not enough for them to do more than send a LL.
