    I know I am stupid for doing this but had 3 seizures at my homes address, about 18 months between each one. Is there a time scale they flag address for?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wont be using home address again anyway thats for sure!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I posted up a topic about myByBox UK, I tried out and had a package seized, yet others on here are still getting packages arrive there ok, is flagging a myth, I cant imagine with the amount of mail arriving in UK they check each address?!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone who may of worked in customs confirm whether flagging is true? Maybe they just pick random packages and check addresses?

    In the US flagging is certainly real and I am sure it is real in any country with a computerized postal system such as the UK.  Your address is definitely flagged, as can be seen by all the seized packages sent to you.  Are you not getting charged with what was in these packages or what?

    No, just had letter saying goods had been seized and if I felt it was wrong could appeal against it, which means go to court, which I didnt do of course lol. That was the end of it, but if my address was flagged how have I have internations get through no problem without even being checked by customs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Answer to other question (as I am not sure how to multi quote!) Purchases were outside of SR, I am still yet to order on SR, I am trying to find a drop box I can open with fake ID, want to take as many security measures as poss before I make first order!

    I think you answered your own question, when you pointed out that you still get mail. If it were flagged......

    So I guess address flagging isn't true, however once a package gets seized I guess they store name and address on computer so if another gets seized they will know? I was quite scared after 3rd package seized although there was 18 months between each package, I cleaned house anyway but didnt hear anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One other thing I find real strange is for years when packages get seized is always followed with a letter, this time no letter has been received after 5 weeks, FEDEX confirmed package was with customs and to call them but I dont fancy doing that!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else had anything seized in UK lately and not had letter?

    Your address isn't flagged.  I've received more than a hundred seizure letters across a large number of addresses.  Some addresses got one every month.  I used to get a seizure letter every week.  Thousands and thousands of people get seizure letters everyday in the US.  Try to imagine how much it would cost to "flag" all of these people.  The numbers are astronomical.  The cost of closely watching the mail going to these millions of addresses is ridiculously impossible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only time an address is "flagged" like many users here believe is when there is actually an investigation going on and every case that I am aware of where that happened they did not send a seizure letter.

    They don't flag shit unless you're under some federal investigation for moving bricks of cocaine on a daily basis or some shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had multiple packages get hit by customs before and they just send you a letter that says your package was intercepted and contained contraband, if you feel this is in error call us to appeal etc etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A couple weeks later a package with the same shit in it arrived just fine.

    So with international shipments it seems pretty standard for them to just send a letter from customs saying your delivery contained contraband and was confiscated etc etc.

    <br/>
    What about with USPS domestic in the US?  I've heard rumors of the pink slip or letter?  Is that essentially the same as a letter from customs?  Jack n Hoff you seem to have a lot of experience with getting letters.  Have you received one of these rumored pink letters from the USPS?  I'm not sure where you are so perhaps that doesn't apply to you.

    A pink slip is a notice that you were not around to sign for a package.  You take it to the local post office to retrieve your package.  I've never had a domestic shipment intercepted.  I've never had a shipment from China intercepted.  I've only had shipments from South America, Europe and the Middle East intercepted.

    <br/>
    fuk it, i guess domestic is bad, unless they build a case, but this was just some edibles and all this shit could of been stopped if the fedz wanted to cuz, by then i think they can allow a letter go out to identify a recipeinet or even the sender,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    WHAT IM WORRIED ABOUT IS IF , THEY CONTACT A REAL RETURN ADDRESS, and with that, they SEE the people who sent it isnt to blame, and come after me? because i used a real name and address

    Whether they flag or not they will be keeping a record of the seizures recorded to that address and by your own admission you now have 3 confirmed seizures to your home address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my experience one no show burns an address but then I'm very cautious, all you are doing in continuing to order is building a case, you can probably plead ignorance once or even twice but if you have half a dozen intercepts good luck explaining that away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Get some safe anonymous drops set up that are not linked to you, the last thing you really want to be doing is handing over your home address to anyone on SR, we have just recently seen one pissed off banned vendor mass posting buyer info all over these forums and you would not want to see your details splashed on here for everyone to see.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Talk to the right people and I'm sure you can get yourself set up safely in the UK.

     In my experience one no show burns an address but then I'm very cautious, all you are doing in continuing to order is building a case, you can probably plead ignorance once or even twice but if you have half a dozen intercepts good luck explaining that away.

     Get some safe anonymous drops set up that are not linked to you, the last thing you really want to be doing is handing over your home address to anyone on SR, we have just recently seen one pissed off banned vendor mass posting buyer info all over these forums and you would not want to see your details splashed on here for everyone to see.

     Talk to the right people and I'm sure you can get yourself set up safely in the UK.

    Yes your correct I shoould of really set us some dead drops a long time ago, without going into too much detail the packages were steroids and HGH, they were legal to import until about 12 months ago, however it was legal for personal amounts and what was order was more than that, that was reason for seizure. Its pretty much a smack on the wrist offense for first time.

    i think my package was stopped due to the return address being of a real place of buiness, and i think the inspector noticed that these packages were different becasue the  vendor said he sent them near that actual buisness, so i think what happened is they singled out the package after seeing the different between the real buisness and mail fraud

     Your address isn't flagged.  I've received more than a hundred seizure letters across a large number of addresses.  Some addresses got one every month.  I used to get a seizure letter every week.  Thousands and thousands of people get seizure letters everyday in the US.  Try to imagine how much it would cost to "flag" all of these people.  The numbers are astronomical.  The cost of closely watching the mail going to these millions of addresses is ridiculously impossible.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The only time an address is "flagged" like many users here believe is when there is actually an investigation going on and every case that I am aware of where that happened they did not send a seizure letter.

    Your last line kinda scared me a little.  I had a schedule 1 seized 3 months back, never received a letter.   My circumstance may have been different because from what the vendor says, ALL of his packs that went through ISC that weekend get seized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I cleaned house and waited for about 2 weeks and no one came.  Nothing out of the ordinary in my neighborhood either.  I stopped ordering packages to my home since, but with what I just said, and based on your knowledge.  Would you think i'd be under investigation?

      Your address isn't flagged.  I've received more than a hundred seizure letters across a large number of addresses.  Some addresses got one every month.  I used to get a seizure letter every week.  Thousands and thousands of people get seizure letters everyday in the US.  Try to imagine how much it would cost to "flag" all of these people.  The numbers are astronomical.  The cost of closely watching the mail going to these millions of addresses is ridiculously impossible.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The only time an address is "flagged" like many users here believe is when there is actually an investigation going on and every case that I am aware of where that happened they did not send a seizure letter.

     Your last line kinda scared me a little.  I had a schedule 1 seized 3 months back, never received a letter.   My circumstance may have been different because from what the vendor says, ALL of his packs that went through ISC that weekend get seized.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I cleaned house and waited for about 2 weeks and no one came.  Nothing out of the ordinary in my neighborhood either.  I stopped ordering packages to my home since, but with what I just said, and based on your knowledge.  Would you think i'd be under investigation?

    If it was small then I wouldn't sweat it.  If it wasn't small then they would usually do a CD.  They might be watching the mail to that address more.  I've seen cases in the US where they have caught narcotics addressed to someone, taken them, not sent a seizure letter, caught more narcotics addressed to the same address months later because they were watching the mail and then went and arrested the person with an arrest warrant and searched the address with a search warrant.

    Since then i've only ordered one domestic SR related package and it came in without any problems.  I've also ordered a bunch of legitimate stuff from overseas sites (mostly HK and China) and had 0 issues.

    Paranoia was too crazy, I took all deliveries away from home until I move.

    Holy shit!  I would delete that amount asap because that is pretty linkable.  That is a lot man.  We're talking about federal trafficking through the postal system.  That amount carries some heavy mandatory minimum sentencing in many states in the US if you were to be caught in possession of that amount just on state charges unrelated to the postal system...  :(
