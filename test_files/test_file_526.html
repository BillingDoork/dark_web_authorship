    What do you think?Â  Is it safer to ship to a P.O. Box in the United States?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, does the name on the letter/package need to match the person who the Box is registered to?

    If you manage to get a PO box open with cash and without it being linked to your real identity, then it would be safer. However as far as I know, you're required to use 2 forms of legit ID to open one. In that case its not much safer since they can just pull up your name and address, so its the same risk as just having it shipped where you live.

    When I signed up for my PO BOX I showed my real ID cards but briefly. They just wanted to make sure I was legal or whatever. I don't think they even wrote down my real address or full name. Remember, if it is really only domestic delivery, a postal worker won't think twice about it but you'll think 100 times about it. To them, it is just another day...delivering the mail.
