    I voted 0, but I did actually have one unsuccessful order.  I received the product from the vendor, a vendor that I trusted and had ordered from a few times before, but the batch the vendor had was bunk, and he partial refunded me outside of escrow.  He also made it good on the next order from a GREAT batch, so I count that as a net success.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All orders went to a single PO box address associated with a fake identity (not John Doe or some other blatantly fake identity--it's a convincing identity, just not mine).  I still order to that PO box to this day.

    In over 40 successful orders I've only had one that didn't make it and it was just a sample.
    <br/>
    The seller was brand new and was really sloppy with his packaging so even the re-ship didn't make it (domestic).
    <br/>
    I only paid like $5 for shipping so I didn't really care about it. I've saved a ton of money using SR so even if I get scammed I'll never regret using SR.

    To be safe, yeah agreed, but.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My PO box isn't associated with my true identity in any way, except for CCTV at the post office...if a single package doesn't arrive there (and so far I'm 42/42 at that box), I would be more likely to assume that USPS messed up, or maybe the vendor messed up, than that LE is on my ass at the PO box.  I doubt I'd burn it after a single no show.  It seems highly unlikely that a CD will happen at a PO box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now for residential addresses, where a CD is something that could happen on any order, regardless of the addressee, then yes, one no-show means don't risk the next one.

    I would never make the assumption of anything just for convenience sakes, admittedly having a very successful PO box not in your name would be hard to let go of and if a no show happened I would like you most probably be tempted to push it after a break of a month or two and try again. A lot however would depend on the size of the order that didn't make it if I were making calculated judgements on whether to burn or risk using again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't make the mistake of assuming LE will not attempt a CD at a PO box, I have heard of one unlucky person in my country currently facing serious charges in part evidenced by CCTV from post offices, you can never be too careful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay safe people.

    I've had three unsuccessful orders, but one was definitely a selective scam of sorts and the other two just disappeared into the sea of international mail never to be seen again. I do switch up addresses and take breaks though. Just as Same said, you can't be too careful.

    Both have been 5 weeks, One from MIMM &amp; one from Nevita. Saying that, I live in a hard to post country and have yet to go through the resolution process. I am going to wait another week in the unlikely event they turn up.
    <br/>
    Funny enough, they are also the only two orders I FE'd, being a novice newbie. All my other domestic and international orders are still coming through.
    <br/>
    Customs Problem or FE scam?
