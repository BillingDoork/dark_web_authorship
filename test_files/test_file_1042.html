    Does USPS accept notes/signs left on the door as a signature? My drop is going to be out of the house most likely when an international tracked package comes and the mail service here is notoriously shoddy when it comes to leaving slips saying it needs to be picked up etc.

    I don't know but that is throwing all plausible deniability out the window.

    They won't accept that. Call and request a re-delivery and advise that no one will be home to sign for it and ask if there is another solution then a re-delivery.

    <br/>
    From USPS:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    : Waiver of Signature
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A "Waiver of Signature" is initiated by the Sender and authorizes delivery of mail at the letter carrier's discretion (if area is secured and protected from weather) without obtaining the recipient's signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: Waiver of Signature must be checked at time of mailing by the Sender. It cannot be amended in transit. If the item is not claimed within five days by the Recipient, it will be returned to the Sender."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Domestic Express MailÂ®:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The letter carrier will sign for the domestic Express Mail item as proof of delivery and leave the item in a secure location.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Waiver of Signature is not available with additional insurance or for Express Collect on Delivery (COD).
    <br/>
    A waiver of signature will void any insurance claims for loss of the package. (However, a claim may be filed for damaged or missing contents or for service failures).
