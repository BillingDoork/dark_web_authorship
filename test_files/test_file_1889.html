    I ordered two packages to an address that I've used in the past before, a rooming house with more than 10 residents to be exact. I am a close neighbor and knew the code to get in due to parties in the past and normally have no problems. I ordered with a fake name and usually the package just sits in the room where everyone's mail is so I can easily come by in the night and pick it up. However, this time there was a new resident who decided to go around asking who owned the package. Since no one there knew who it belonged to he decided to be nosy and opened it. Out fell 3 grams of white powder. Needless to say he freaked out and called the cops who came immediately and took the package and flagged the house for future shipments. I was watching from a safe distance and heard the new idiot resident complaining about "heroin!" to the two cops (which it wasn't).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In order to prevent this thing from happening again, I urge sellers to ship with extreme stealth. For example, if you are going to have "Tech Solutions" on the return address please hide the baggy in a small computer part. This way even if the wrong person opens the package they wont freak out and call the cops, they'll just try to plug it in the computer and it wont work so they'll throw it away. Be creative. It's better than getting the police involved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm 99% sure that I won't get any of the heat since my prints are not on the package but I can't say the same for my supplier. I appreciate the sellers on here and wouldn't want them to get busted.

    Yep, don't leave traces on the computer that connects you to SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone could ship anything to anybody, remember this (As long as you 're not ordering bulk, which is not the case...)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sellers take precaution, they don't leave any traces:

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any LEA could order from any of the sellers on SR and receive the package, and this has been done more than once probably. Worry about you, not them.

    A lot of the time adding outside packaging makes the item a lot bigger. IMO the best thing is vacuum seal then mylar on the outside so you can't see it.

    He isn't complaining, he is suggesting that sellers take additional lengths to prevent accidental-discovery situations. In other words, packages being opened by people they aren't intended for.

    Am I opposed to lessening the  chances that a package is opened by someone it isn't intended for?  Uh, no.

    <br/>
    And you know a good way to lessen the chances of a package being opened by someone it isn't intended for?  Addressing it to the person it IS intended for.

    100% your fault OP.

    Use your real address.and don't call this new resident an idiot.  You're having drug's sent to his house, he opens it and finds white powder ... I would likely call the police too actually.

    the only reason you should be notifying a seller about this is to apologize for your incompetence, OP.  there are at least 20 threads that make a big deal about not using drops that are out of your control, ESPECIALLY if said drop can lead to package being opened by an unfriendly third party.  you should have your buyer's stats taken away until you decide to use the resources here and learn a little more.

    Maybe OP was partially responsible for this, but in his plight there is a real message to be headed. Most vendor's packaging is far beyond terrible, most packages could be opened and known instantly, a little real stealth would be awesome.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stealth means being able to open the package, look at the contents and think its innocent, such as no powder falling out.
    <br/>
    Stealth means the return address matches the contents, and is a real legitimate address.
    <br/>
    Stealth means vendors fingerprints shouldn't be all over the inside or outside of the package.
    <br/>
    Stealth means the return address that was successful for the last hundred packages should not be used for awhile.
    <br/>
    Stealth means once the packages start to disappear, that the packaging and return addresses must change.
    <br/>
    Stealth does NOT mean masking agents such as coffee, perfume, any scent at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The truth is most of the above points are the opposite of what your average vendor on SR provides you as a service. Due to the nature of postal services packages will accidentally be ripped and tore open, while not what happened in OP's case the same logic applies.

    If you don't want the seller to get burned, stop being so paranoid and sending shit to drops that you have no control of. Send it to a friends house or even your own, or work. Theres a million ways you could've don't this correctly and you have certainly created the most Epic fail Ive seen in the threads thus far.

    As a vendor, I would not be willing to give any refund for this whatsoever. They did their job. They got the contraband to you. Obviously you were taking a huge risk by getting it sent to a house that's not your own.

    Who orders drugs to their friend's house without telling them anyway? That's probably the worst thing a friend could possibly do.

    there, i fixed you post.  deleted text denoted by brackets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if a buyer does proper research, it's not too hard to order only from vendors with good packaging/shipping methods.  although, we would all obviously benefit from every vendor taking every precaution possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in this incident, what it really comes down to is the fact that the new resident OPENED it.  (isn't that illegal?)

    totally unacceptable  vendors you have there OP.  it's their responsibility to get products to us safely! they should be flying to each of our drops to evaluate its structural and environental integrity themselves!  they act like we live in a world where someone could somehow easily obtain a mailing address that is not accessible torandom members of the public. i mean, come on guys, we aren't living in a philip k dick novel here.  next thing you'll be tellling me there are carriages that can propel themselves without a horse!

    Thinking about the fact that you mail drugs under a random name to a place with multiple people makes me ill.  How dumb could someone be? It was a question of when not if a package would get opened.  Better packaging? Give me a break.  Your drop was as careless as I have ever heard.

    Yep. The guy who opened it is an asshole. But no one is going to prosecute that asshole, because it contained drugs. OP can't step forward and say "Yeah, that was supposed to be mine, so you committed a crime."

    OP during your next purchase PM the vendor first and ask if you can pay more for extra stealth shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Currently it is the responsibilty of the vendor to ship your item in a manner that if the box or envelope were to accidently rip open in shipment the items will still be not visible.  For instance a mylar impulse seal would be a visual barrier.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are asking for something a bit more.  You would like it to be so stealth that if an unsuspecting person opened the package and broke the seal to get passed the visual barrier they wouldn't find the goods.  If this is something you are interested in then that may be offered on a case-by-case basis for a nominal fee; PM the vendor.

    This is the fucking dumbest thing I have ever heard.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For one, why the fuck are you sending stuff to a place where it could be got at by other people? There is mistake number 1.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Point number two, why aren't you using your real name? If this guy saw your name he'd have probably given it to you and you could have had a grand old time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leading on to fact number three, why people are so surprised that people open other people's mail is completely beyond me. If someone sent something to me by mistake I'd probably open it, you never know there could be some cheddar in that letter. Especially if it looks like a greeting card or something. And lets be real for half a minute here, nobody can bullshit and say that they are impervious to that shit. When it comes down to it if it's not a business letter most would do it. I'd definitely take the letter out of the house to open it, but I'd definitely open it none the less.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fault is in no way on the seller, he sent you your shit, your shit actually got to you but some muggins got to it first because YOU the OP FUCKED IT UP. This shit isn't Chess, it's more like Snakes and Ladders. Take some fucking responsibility.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sellers, do not read this and OP may God have mercy on your soul.

    Seriously, what were you expecting?  The worst part of it all is: no one was probably suspicious of anything going on, LE or PO, and now they're going to be on the lookout, in your neighbor, and possibly being more paranoid of what's coming through the system.  The only reason they are now, is the OP didn't want to take the risk of sending it to his own address with his own name - where you still have plausible deniability - but since LE only showed up because they were called, it would have been just fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you realize that if you get caught sending it to someone else, especially at a different address, and you pick up the package - that's mail fraud and a federal offense?  Apples to apples, I don't agree with having it shipped to places other people are living, least of all if you don't know them / have some arrangement with them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as SELLERS packaging their stuff better, lets get realistic.  Do you think it makes sense for a seller to go buy a whole bunch of PC parts etc to put in the boxes, on top of vacuum etc sealing?  That's going to effect your bottom line a lot, and it's only really an option with small quantities of things.  If you order an O, are you expecting a laptop to be sent to conceal it all???

    I whole heartedly agree.  The more ignorant users that take part, the more likely things are going to come crumbling down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think people give enough credit to some of their mail employees..  The ones that I've known, are pretty good with names and who lives where, they know it looks weird if it's not a usual person they deliver to.  But if it's delivered to YOU, where YOU get regular mail and occasional packages, it shouldn't arise any suspicion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to get technical, the mail system in the states is heavily underfunded, they've been cutting back hours and locations and pushing their delivery personnel to finish up their routes more quickly... they should be happy to have the added revenue that something like SR provides and as long as people like OP don't give LE a reason to get involved and put the mail system under further scrutiny, then the success rate should remain high.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if you want to paint a target on your back, by all means, I just don't want to have any part in it.

      Come on man, Google.  You're asking about technical topics it's obvious you presently lack the IT skill for, so to ask someone to write up detailed descriptions for you and then answer your questions back and forth is a bit uncool.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I promise that most of the people who know the things you're talking about, learned by reading and experimenting, it's outrageous to expect me to easily give you a rundown of the different types of VPNs (PPTP, L2TP, etc) and their pros and cons.  No to mention that you either need to run your own server (which I'm guessing is not an option) or pay for access to someone else's server with VPN on it.  Please do some research and don't expect complex topics to be spoon fed to you, we all have lives too.

    You asked someone to PM you instructions, that sounds like you wanted someone to hand it to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As someone in the technology scene, it's super annoying to get questions like "how do I setup a VPN?".  You're not on a technology blog, and you do not understand what you're asking and how complicated of a topic it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm glad that someone was able to give you a simple cookie cutter answer in one word, he gave you a good answer for your bad question.  You didn't ask on some options or some advice on getting started, to properly do these things, you need to have a grasp of the technologies you're dealing with - one which is best done by doing some research on your own FIRST and then asking questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You want to ask a few questions about technologies, great, I'll even help you out, but if you give just a super generic topic and ask someone to PM you how to do it... it doesn't work like that and it would be irresponsible to send you into network configs blindly without some precursor knowledge.  I'm not trying to be a dick specifically to you, but people who are too lazy to do any research on their own and want answers and long, detailed descriptions just handed to them as if you were calling technical support - no one with higher level skills is going to want to do that all the time.  Ask specific questions, not for directions on a giant topic =/

    Jeff just let it go, your reply makes you come of as a total prick. The poor guy did not demand someone PM him and hold his hand, but I know for a fact there are several people here that are actually somewhat tolerable to deal with and don't get all pissy when asked simple questions. Those people sometimes have extra time in their day in which they can help people with issues like these, you though would rather take that time to be a jerk.

    sorts everything out in my opinion. When you want to place an order, send a pigeon to the seller, the seller can smash the package up the pigeons arse (eggs come out, quite a payload), release the pigeon and it will fly home. sorted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for stealth (because i think of everything) You could put bits of tin foil around the bird, wires and stuff so if ever it didnt make it and was found people might think its a computer component.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and for those of you who will doubt the holding capacity of a pigeons bum, well let me tell you. There is only one thing that bothers me, if indeed it decides to empty its bowls on the way, in which case i advise the seller to tie a bit of string to the package and the birds foot.

    I never said you were a retard ;)  Nor do I hate on you for being new to the scene and not having  a firm grasp.  All I'm saying is asking someone to PM you instructions (which I believe you did in fact do) isn't super conducive to getting a proper answer.  If you have questions, post a thread, get it up for discussion, and show us that you did try to do a little research on your own.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get that it's not easy to get into, which is why it's just as bad to expect that I could probably give you an explanation of how to setup a VPN without pushing my own personal bias int it.  No, I'm not angry or bitter, but it's a complex topic that demands more than a) hijacking a thread or b) a PM to lay it all out for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're looking for a VPN that works native with Windows without extra software, you've only got a couple of options, if you need it to work on all OSes then there are certain other stipulations.  Would you be running it on a Windows server or a Linux server, because the setup for LT2P/IPSEC on Linux is more more of a bastard than a Windows server, but you can run it without installing extra software, unlike OpenVPN, which is more flexible but requires a client to be installed on every computer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My point is it's a complex answer and the scope of what you're asking isn't finite enough to get a proper response.  The response you got was a stand-alone program, not quite the same as what you asked, so your question in itself went unanswered and that illustrates what I'm trying to express to you.

    Back on topic so I can stop feeling like a douche hijacking this thread and flame waring over something grossly petty...  The general consensus here seems to be that very few people have sympathy if you aren't sending it to a valid name who is waiting on the package.  Hopefully the cases where the unintended receiver gets it and they get in trouble do not exist, but it would be kind of a dick move to get your neighbor in trouble for your package.

    I wouldent be surprised if some vendors are put right off from doing any business with him. He painted him self into a corner, put both his feet in his mouth and then had the audacity to ask vendors to become a PC World franchise so he can behave a savage, send stuff to random innocent people in an attempt not to get caught. When there is no risk involved anyway.... If he understood how this community works then he would understand that all that can really happen to the buyer is loss of money. Its the vendor that runs the most risk.
    <br/>
    He really does insult the intelligence of the people who sparked his idea off in the first place.

     Come on man, Google.  You're asking about technical topics it's obvious you presently lack the IT skill for, so to ask someone to write up detailed descriptions for you and then answer your questions back and forth is a bit uncool.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I promise that most of the people who know the things you're talking about, learned by reading and experimenting, it's outrageous to expect me to easily give you a rundown of the different types of VPNs (PPTP, L2TP, etc) and their pros and cons.  No to mention that you either need to run your own server (which I'm guessing is not an option) or pay for access to someone else's server with VPN on it.  Please do some research and don't expect complex topics to be spoon fed to you, we all have lives too.

    instead of doing all that or trying to figure out all of the complicated stuff, why not use an old lap-top with wi-fi and go down to your local mcdonalds and log in through their wi-fi which is free and while you sit in your car and do what you need to do, i keep my old lap top for just this purpose.  it does not turn on  when im at home. i go to mcdonalds, get some awesome fries and place my other order :) simple.... no vpn. ppoe, hunting socks5 and you get fries with that :)

    After some serious thinking I suggest...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone who is foolish enough to post on here they're complaints of orders not turning up having used a fake name and address should have they're accounts suspended for a short time. (1-2) weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Reasons for this is that it shows great disrespect to vendors and also shows a very irresponsible and cowardly attitude. Both of which are not need here on SilkRoad.

    Do people think this is a bit harsh or is it the correct way to dealing with these people ???
