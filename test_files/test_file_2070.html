    I'm in the UK. A couple of weeks ago I ordered 1g of a class A drug from a UK vendor who I have used before and trust completely. Normally it would be next day delivery. However it never showed up. After a week myself and the vendor amicably agreed to split the diference and he sent the same again (to a different address) for half price.
    <br/>
    All good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last monday though, at the original address (which is a multioccupancy house where everyone has access to mail on a table in  hall; I don't live there but partner owns flat and we get plenty mail there already) a card came saying "we were unable to deliver your item due to unpaid postage (50p+£1 charge)"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can either collect it from depot,
    <br/>
    Pay online by credit/.debit card and have it redelivered
    <br/>
    or affix 3 stamps to card and have it redelivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My first instinct is to leave well alone.
    <br/>
    However the third option seemed possible. I was dithering about it turning it over in my head, but I was unable to trust my judgement as I have been overdoing valium the past week and was becoming somewhat scatty. Unable to decide and driving myself mad, I rather foolishly burnt the card, thus removing temptation .....unfortunately removing the safest way of possibly retreiving this package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously I am quite the dickhead...in my defence I had reached that stage of valium abuse where I could barely find my shoes!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, now the only realistic option is to go to the depot with £1.50 and some proof of address. I could act like I wasn't expecting any mail, but got the card and came down out of curiosity. (bear in mind it could be any of the other residents using my name to order stuff)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem is I cant decide  if this is an obvious trap....but I cant see LE staking out the post office. I suppose they could have instructed the staff to keep me talking while they ring the cops when I come to collect. But what i I had selected one of the redelivery options? It all seems a lot of trouble to go to over 1 measly g.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other option is the stamp just fell off and all i need to do to get my lovely drugs is turn up with my £1.50
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've reached the point where I dont know what the fuck to think. At the moment I have no intention of going in there....but then I don't like the idea of a gram of class A with my name on it possibly being opened in a week or sos time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts?

    by which i mean any thoughts other than " lay off the valium a bit dickhead"  At present I'm thinking, fuck it, is it worth risking it, I should just
    <br/>
    let it go....I've had the reship and so I'm only down £40 or so....I shouldn't let the greedy thought of a gram cloud my judgement.
    <br/>
    I just wondered if this is a well known ploy of LE i should be aware of?

    I'd affix the stamps to the card; use gloves. Someone could be staking out your mailbox and have ordered and then sent the card on your behalf without your knowledge. Stick to this theory if ever confronted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leave the envelope in your mailbox for a few days after it arrives, make sure LE isn't trying to do a controlled delivery.

    i would get it for sure mate he prob forgot to stamp it or made it fatter than 5mils so u need to pay more ,weight wouldnt be the prob if 1 g ,i sent 9 bar to my mate years ago and he rang panicking big time saying they want me to go down saying i have to pay a couple quid ,and id forgot to stamp it
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if its even average packaging it will be fine uk to uk even if it was busted they just come and see u not play these games for a g
    <br/>
    its pretty normal thing for xmas cards and letters to get called in if postage payment is short and people at the depo have been told to snag any under payments and when RM skint they do ,even if u collect it dosnt mean u new what it was u were curious and hoped it wouldnt be a shitty post card but wanted to know

    Yes unfortunately I burned the card. Not out of paranoia but simply because I became awarwe I was in no fit state to make such a judgement and in my confused state it seemed like the right thing to do.
    <br/>
    Now I've sobered somewhat I realise I've destroyed the safest way of doing it, so I'll just have to balls it out. I might give it a try in the morning. I tend to agree that I can't see LE playing these silly games over a G. It's more likely to be a postage error. If I go in with the attitude that I'm not expecting anything but just curious.

    No way it's a trap. If they caught it and wanted to chase it up, they'd have a warrant for your house. For a gram I doubt they'd even bother, not that internal mail is really looked at at all; I bet if pills started falling out of a parcel they'd put it in one of those "sorry we broke your parcel" bags and send it on anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    50p short = somebody used lick-and-stick stamps for a tiny parcel and the stamp fell off or something. Happened to me before, went to pick it up, paid my money, got my parcel, everything was fine.

    Ok just to update I decided to go and get it. Unfortunately having burnt the card due to the reasons above I no longer had the reference number which the postal worker assured me I needed :  " I've got 3000 items back here I can't go through them all" After making him try 26,256,265,56 and a few others he got exasperated and said he'd take my phone number and ring me if he found it.
    <br/>
    I drove away feeling slightly more paranoid, and wishing I hadnt burnt card. This had been the only possible scenario I could imagine LE involvement: the letter has a little note on it saying if someone try's to collect ring officer 12345 and arrange the customer to return at a set time. (anything else is just gonna take too much manpower for a g of h) Having not got the ref number though I couldnt tell if this was an innocent explanation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I decided I'd see if when he rang back I'd see if he tried to get me to commit to a specific time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Later that day I got the phone call "hi mate it's Paul from depot, found your item (it was 276 by the way) when do you want to collect it?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was vague " agh maybe tommorrow morning maybe day after"  thinking its no way police are gonna bother staking out post office depot .
    <br/>
    Then I went in immediately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure enough I paid my £1.50 and got an envelope that looked nice and familiar.
    <br/>
    With No Fucking Stamps On!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I drove away carefully checking rear view! Got back to work( I'm a self employed tradesman) and opened my lovely gram of skag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, technically, since we did a 50% reship:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor has been paid for 1.5g and sent 2
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have paid for 1.5 and received 2
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT if we factor in the week of checking the drop everyday on the original order ( and I guess we all know that disappointment ) AND the paranoia and pantshitting fear of collecting the fucker I'm inclined to call it quits. I haven't told the vendor yet. He seemed quite keen for me not to go; even offering another free .5 g. ( he has been a great vendor in all my dealings with him and I can't fault his customer service usuaslly)
    <br/>
    But since he normally puts 2 stamps on ( to avoid any width issues with the padding) Im pretty sure he just forgot ( or a minion) to put stamps on this letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I feel my free 1/2 g is fair enough for putting a letter full of heroin in a postbox with my name and address on it WITH NO STAMPS!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was lovely gear too; shame I couldn't feel it properly as I'm on 8mg subutex a day. Even missing my dose for 3 days i was still locked out. I even resorted to hitting up which I hasvent done for years. It felt sweet to hit that needle but I've lost knack a bit. First two hits didn't leave a mark but after that I bruised up my legs and then arms( trying to use legs so people don't see by my leg veins were never very reliable.
    <br/>
    The gear was definitely decent I could tell by smell and taste ( been into gear since early nineties) just these subutex handcuffs! I'm in the process now of tapering down the subs but I've been on them several years and the WDs are slooooooow! It'll be better all round if I'm on a smaller dose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway I digress.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say from reading on these forums that 99% of LE scares are paranoia. If the pigs are coming they'll just come and knock or kick your door. But it's different when it happens to you. It's hard not to imagine worst. My advice is remember you are a small small small fish in a big big pond. Unless your a vendor in which case you probably can't be careful enough!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks to those who posted your sensible advice, you got me a nice gram of smack!

    Sounds like you're over paranoid to be honest... Paranoia is actually worth having in this business, or any business where someone attempts to, or does, break the law.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If police wanted to get involved, it would've probably been a controlled delivery, but I tell you what - your sorting office workers are much friendlier than ours!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Out of curiosity, which vendor was this? 'No Sticks No Seeds'? (Or is his name no sticks no stems..? Bah, I digress).
