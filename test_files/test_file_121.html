    Hello everyone,
    <br/>
    I've been on the road for quite some time, and had my first unfortunate event.
    <br/>
    A vendor sent out a package, and the package for some reason didn't make it to my PO Box, and consequently was sent back to the fake address return label..
    <br/>
    My first and last name are on the package, along with correct zip according to the DCN the vendor told me.
    <br/>
    How much should I worry about this?
    <br/>
    Without going in to too much detail, if the said drug doesn't look like a normal "strain" of that said drug---will they not test it for any illegal molecules?
    <br/>
    I'm really hoping for the best in this situation... :-\
    <br/>
    but if all doesn't work out I'm stayingÂ  :-X
    <br/>
    Thanks for any advice, comments, and concerns.
   </dd>

    I guess it depends on your country, but most of the times mail that fail delivery and return is just destroyed/stolen without much inspection, they really don't care about it around here.

    not to hijack, but a quick question or two that is relevant - Would a PO Box be ideal to use if you dont have a safe house / location to ship to? Also, do they cost money or link back to you at all? I've never used one, but it seems like a good idea.
