    hey guys!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    took the chance to order from a new vendor to see what it's like... communication was great and very helpful, got the tracking code just after it got sent and checked it first after 3 days... and it says it's stopped by customs (in country of origin) and cointains illegal substances.
    <br/>
    now i confronted the vendor with this fact and he says: Oh, that's bad luck but i can offer you 50% refund or half the order sent again!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So... my question is... how can i get back all my money (i'm still in ESCROW)??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thx

    The new vendor must have handled / packaged it bad to have stink coming off / out of it in that short time frame.

    Hi waldheimer,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's great that you've stayed in escrow! When the option to put the item into resolution becomes available, click the link and explain the situation (including any evidence you might have) to the administrator that is presiding over it. Please note that clicking on 'resolution' automatically extends the due-date by 5 days, but an administrator will step in when that period is up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check out the SR Wiki for more information on what to do in this situation:
    <br/>
    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#My_order_hasn.27t_arrived_or_it.27s_not_what_I_expected.

     <br/>
     If your order hasn't come after waiting 10 days, you should click "resolve" next to it on your orders page. This will put the order into resolution. Read all of the instructions in the Resolution Center, and try to come to an agreeable resolution with your vendor.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    i mean i would be willing to accept a partial refund if the letter was intercepted like in my country... but it's not.. so i see all the fault at sellers site for sloppy packing... also there are more and more complaints from other users about this!!

    The option to enter resolution will appear 10 days from the date the order was placed in transit so that should be about 6 days from now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Indeed, if the package didn't even make it out of the origin country the vendor will likely have to up their game in the packaging department!

    The price of the coins won't matter if the item was hedged in escrow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On a site note, a little trick to tell if your order is hedged or not if the listing is removed and you aren't in the resolution center is to visit http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account There you can see if you have money in USD it's in escrow or if you have money in BTC it is not hedged.

    Personally I think that 70% is a fair compromise. The vendor did send the package, and it may have been damaged in transit etc. which allowed postal workers to find it. It's completely up to you what you do next, but do keep in mind that you may get a smaller refund if you choose not to accept the 70%. You may also get a larger refund, but 70% is fair in my opinion. The decision will be made by the administrator if you can't eventually come to an agreement with the vendor, and that decision will be final.

    70% is a fair comp. Vendor did lose product. 100% on internationals is rare. Super Trips does though!

    That's exactly it, waldheimer. Don't FE - if you do, there's a possibility he won't return the BTC and there's nothing we'll be able to do. Some buyers and vendors do work things like this out privately, but usually only when they've been doing business with each other for a very long time. Whatever you do, don't finalise.

    I think 50% return is fair enough. Yes it did get stopped and maybe the vendor didn't package it well but, it could of just been bad luck, or just one of those things. But as a buyer you should be aware of the chance that you're  taking ordering overseas and the chances of it getting intercepted is highly probable. So a 50/50 loss on both vendor and buyer I find is fair enough. Having a vendor cough up 100% on a order that didn't make it would make him  on a 100% loss with the buyer receiving the full refund just doesn't seem fair when BOTH parties made the agreement on the order.  Even the best stealth do get intercepted..It's a game of chance when it comes to international orders and that's why I stay clear and stick with domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact that he offered escrow for a international order says something also. Most vendors due to the high risk and the long transit times they ask for escrow.  Also the vendor offering 70% is awfully generous of the vendor IMO.

     I think 50% return is fair enough. Yes it did get stopped and maybe the vendor didn't package it well but, it could of just been bad luck, or just one of those things. But as a buyer you should be aware of the chance that you're  taking ordering overseas and the chances of it getting intercepted is highly probable. So a 50/50 loss on both vendor and buyer I find is fair enough. Having a vendor cough up 100% on a order that didn't make it would make him  on a 100% loss with the buyer receiving the full refund just doesn't seem fair when BOTH parties made the agreement on the order.  Even the best stealth do get intercepted..It's a game of chance when it comes to international orders and that's why I stay clear and stick with domestic.

     The fact that he offered escrow for a international order says something also. Most vendors due to the high risk and the long transit times they ask for escrow.  Also the vendor offering 70% is awfully generous of the vendor IMO.

    Buying drugs, thru the Road or IRL, is ALWAYS a risk. I agree 50% is fair, and h offered you 70%,,,,,not bad IMO. Remember he's giving back 70%, but, he also loses the value of the product too. So, if you want 100% back , he loses boith the refund $$$$ AND the value of the product.
