    Hi all just a quick question, I live in Aus, and is Spain flagged by customs like NL and Canada are?
    <br/>
    If I buy something with a tracking number do you think the item will come through?

    As far as I know (someone correct me if I'm wrong) but Spain is not a flagged country. I have done many orders from Spain before and feel really comfortable ordering from Spanish vendors.

    Can't be sure but I would err on the side of caution to assume so since it and Portugal are the main entry point of cocaine into Europe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you had to choose a country to receive a package from in Europe to Australia, then the UK is your best bet due to package volumes almost certainly being higher for historical reasons i.e. lots of English have family connections in Australia and visa versa, as well as sharing a common language.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would *not* put a tracking number on any package containing contraband. There are many reasons for this but it is mainly that you're giving Customs a source of intelligence. You are better off being in Standard Mail, no strings attached of any kind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If vendors force you to Finalize early because you're from a distant country leading to longer turnaround time, well that sucks for you, but everything I said ^ is still true whether you like it or not. Either find a vendor that doesn't request early finalization, or you put your faith in a respected vendor with excellent feedback. Otherwise I'd just wait.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People who want things right now are asking for an increased probability of interception and much higher risk for the vendor since they would most likely have to walk into a post office carrying contraband in order to put a tracking number on the parcel. If you are a redistributor, you never should venture out of Standard Mail and you should plan ahead. Since Australia's threshold amounts for most states are miniscule, almost anything you order from SR is likely to get you labelled as a drug vendor even if you're a humble consumer. I mean you can go to prison in Oz for having *fake* MDMA pills. That's right. You can have no drugs whatsoever and get sent down as a major drug dealer. I kid you not. Search the forums for the [intel] tag and Australian threshold amounts and you'll find a LE document showing that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So take my advice about standard mail seriously. Other than choosing a vendor with a brain, it's the single most effective way for you to minimize downside risks. I am tired of giving this advice to people but hopefully you'll consider and apply it.

    That could certainly be the case in terms of overall volume, but the internal domestic market surely can't be that large and so most of it must either be transshipped to the UK asap or held in dark storage somewhere as a form of insurance. I doubt there's many Irish vendors on here. Not to mention that they can't have many geographical arbitrage possibilities (which might make their vendors more likely to ship to Oz, not less, come to think of it). I think there is grahamgreene and he'll know the other ones, you could ask them about the situation on the ground.

     I've seen\heard of people busted with fake pills here, truly ridiculous stuff. Think the laws might vary state to state though, either that or just luck. But I've also heard of a past dealer being caught with a safe full of dud pills and they let him off, different state to my original anecdote.

    Nah Spain is cushty for mail, I have a few custys there and apart from one who was just a cunt and tried to mug me off they have all been fine. The stuff you have to be aware of is shipping containers and large parcels from Spain to the U.K because of their connection with Latin America and Morocco for Blow and Hash respectively but even then that's decreased in recent years because the importers in the U.K are going direct to Latin America. There was a big war about it between the U.K expat Blow-barrons in Marbella and the Scouse Importers in the mid 2000s.

    Ireland has become a major landing point for UK bound cocaine in recent years - this is generally stored for a couple of weeks, split up, then taken to ports on the East coast and shipped from there to the UK; the reason it doesn't seem like this is happening (resulting in no news reports) is because we have a rather inept drugs force, a low-budget intelligence service, a practically non-existent naval service (our fleet totals 8 small ships, at least 2 of which are almost always deployed outside of Irish waters as part of various international taskforces), and 340,000 square kilometers (4 times the area of the entire country) of coastal waters to patrol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There was a case back in 2007 where 1.5 tonnes of cocaine destined for the UK literally washed up on our south west coast completely by chance due to a vessel used by the traffickers capsizing. If a seizure of this magnitude was only discovered by accident, you can imagine how much is getting through unhindered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In 2008 there was a seizure made on foot of an intelligence-led investigation that netted 2.5 tonnes, with very few other seizures worth noting. These are very small scale seizures when you take into account the size of the UK cocaine market.
    <br/>
    Even with Ireland becoming known as a cocaine landing point, the fact that most of it is being moved out of Ireland means that our security forces don't take as much of an interest in it as they would if it was being distributed here, for obvious reasons (no public outcry, meaning no interest by politicians, meaning no reason to waste precious resources.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This also means that Irish exports (including mail) are less likely to be under as close scrutiny as exports from certain other countries. As a result of this, Irish vendors do have an excellent opportunity for providing products to the EU market in particular, but also the US and Australasian markets (in particular Australia) due to the high number of Irish families, students and expatriates there. Prices in Ireland are generally quite high though, even wholesale, so if one were able to source excellent product here at reasonable prices there would be a lot of money to be made on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Spain and Portugal are still major ports of entry to the continental EU market though, so I'd imagine mail from those countries would probably be singled out for more random inspections than mail from countries such as France, Germany, Austria etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not a vendor myself - I work in a drop-shipping capacity to a number of my former IRL customers so I'm more of a middleman.
    <br/>
    daRwin is the only Irish vendor on the Road at the moment, selling weed, mushrooms and prescription drugs but currently only to EU customers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I recall correctly SpanishFly ships hash worldwide from Spain so it might be worth your while messaging him and asking if he'd be comfortable letting you know how successful his Australian shipments are. This might give you an indication of whether to order from Spain or not.
