    Hello. Im new to Silk Road and want to begin sending. I have a few questions:
    <br/>
    -Is a QP of cannabis too much to send?
    <br/>
    -Will a QP of cannabis fit in a usps envelope? Will it fit in a flat rate box?
    <br/>
    -How can I ship it vacuum sealed without destroying the buds by compressing them in the vacuum sealer?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance for all the answers.

    OK, first of all, a fat OP WILL fit in a flat rate box. A medium flat rate box, which if you seal the bud up well enough will end up weighing more than 13 oz. Shipping a package over 13oz using stamps is a big no-no as far as the USPS is concerned. You are either supposed to take it to the counter to pay for it or use the APC, both of which get you on camera, probably multiple times with a good face shot and a pic of your license plate as you come and go. So if you are brave enough and confident that your package contents will not be discovered, go for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I once sent a little under a QP to a buddy and I threw in some shwag and a small amount of a different strain as well, all sealed up properly so there was no smell at all. In a medium flat rate box it weighed in at just a hair under 14oz, so I chanced it, threw some priority stamps on it and dropped it off. I walked to the post office and looked down the entire time so they wouldn't get a good pic of me. Usually Priority flat rate boxes take 3-4 days max, even coast to coast. My buddy waited over 7 days, finally received it and luckily everything was intact. The creepy thing is that it arrived with stickers on it that said "Inspected by postal inspector" or something to that effect. It had not been opened, but it was a close call. I figured they X-rayed it first, saw the different densities and textures, didn't know what to make of it since it was not just a big bag of the same chronic, and sent it on its way with the obligatory stickers explaining why it took so long. Really bad idea in hindsight.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So to answer your question, yes it will fit but you have to take it to the PO in person to not raise suspicion. I recommend breaking it down into like 3 or 4 small flat rate boxes, using different fake but real return addresses, different drops, and that way you can use stamps and minimize the loss of the entire shipment. I know I would rather loose and OZ or so than a QP.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my experience.

    Thanks for the reply. That helps a lot. One more question though:
    <br/>
    Should I just separate each ounce into its own flat rate envelope? Wouldn't that be the best way? Or do I need to use something as big as a box? I was thinking a flat rate envelope because its smaller and no one thinks much of it as opposed to a box.
    <br/>
    Also, should I send each separate ounce out at the same time or wait a day or two in between?
