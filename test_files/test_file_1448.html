    Hi Peeps,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if anyone could pm me how they get their items shipped. I mean to your own house? etc
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help would be appreciated, I think by now I have proven that I'm not LE, but I want to make sure that I can continue on here, everytime some thing is in transit I get worried!

    And it isn't as hard as people say to get things into Australia.

    You just need very good packaging methods. I would say that most of the vendors I have bought from have good packaging, but not very good. DrNyx is an example of someone with very good packaging

    Yep! If you're bringing it by plane, you want to make sure of two things: a) it's overcrowded, b) it's night time. Customs will just let you violate a couple of laws :| Show them some dried vegetables (declaring shit - earns you a big smile from the customs people), look normal (slightly nervous... why wouldn't you be?), have more of it, hide your goods :) I didn't smuggle anything in because it was my first time looking at an airport from that perspective... but it's really easy to smuggle a few grams of whatever the fuck you want lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    International Orders are a bit annoying... Netherlands barely ever gets through to you, and everyone else wants you to FE. Fuck FE's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh yeah... don't buy weed overseas. You're more likely to lose money buying Swazi Gold from Africa at $280/O than you are buying Bush Buds from Australia at $400/O (When adding spendbitcoin's ridiculous 10% fee).

    Nothing is ever 100%. I know with my first purchase, it took a lot of fucking research as to how exactly everything worked, all the hassle with setting up bitcoins, anxiety from when your vendor says the order has been shipped to the moment all that weed hits you and you get mindfucked hard.

    Yea i shouldn't of said 100% but like compared to intl it seems fairly safe seeing as no customs etc, how are they gonna find it apart from smell but then i think double vac seal would get past that, i doubt auspost is fucking running drug dogs over packages for domestic anyway.

    Sorry, didn't realise he was running a charity for us. I mean how dare he offer an incredibly easy, anonymous, quick and simple service to get what many in the rest of the world struggle to get anywhere near as easily, anonymously, quickly or simply.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The nerve of charging 10% on top!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope for your sake you never learn the mark-up on most products you buy on a daily basis or the 'service' charge many businesses put on their service for far less service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And surely don't travel overseas to places where they put 10 to 15% 'service' charge on everything, even when you get no service whatsoever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, if you don't like paying the fee, they're not making you.

    I assume you live in a small town.  If you lived in a city, there's no way you would even wonder this.

    I believe such security is more of a problem in a small town and sorry, can't comment or help.  :(

    Na not a country town, in a city! But I thought the posties would be aware of what is going on  form the media. So thought they might be like this dude gets a lot of express postage packages and alert someone. Its really the express part that worries me they stand out a lot, but I dont like waiting long either LOL

    @Kingpin
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bro an absolutely fuckload of mail goes through the system daily, if they were to tryin analyze even a small percentage of mail to the point your talking about it would slow the postal system to a snails pace and a lot of ppl would be pissed off. Correct me if i'm wrong people but i think LE are much more worried about shit coming into the country than shit moving around within it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you truly are worried then just take precautions so that if you are caught, there's simply no case against you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Things that are found in the silk road buyers guide.
    <br/>
    The system ive found that works is:
    <br/>
    Open a PO box using your OWN ID and order to a fake name (believable), this will give you more plausible deniability than if you use a fake ID because you don't want to be caught 1: looking through someone else box and 2: using a fucking fraudulent ID, thats a bigger crime than ordering personal amounts of weed around im pretty sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you get your package, don't open it straight away and just relax, you havent committed a crime, if LE come flying out of everywhere just look at them with a confused look on your face and say "Its not addressed to me, wtf is in it?" and throw it on the floor like it contains fuckin anthrax or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be extra cautious you could wait a day or 2 and write "return to sender" on it to be overly cautious, but in reality if they know your picking it up they need to bust you within max an hour or something of you getting it since they are not allowed by law to let those drugs re-enter the market/society.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please correct me if i'm wrong anywhere as i don't want to take any risks either!

    For what it's worth, I used to be apart of a business that would send, like, between 10 and 70 Express Post parcels. A day. Every day. All legit, too. The sheer volume of just Express Post envelopes/packages in Australia would be fucking massive. As has been said before, it's a numbers game, and the numbers are stacked in your favour.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think everyone just gets hell paranoid due to the nature of what we're shipping around. And rightly so. But everyone needs to keep a cool head, and be patient.

    My man used to sort mail for Auspost. They would get ounces sent through all the time (the could smell it) . It depends on who picks it up as to what happened with it. If it was a normal guy doing his job and didn't give a fuck about peoples drug habits it got sent to the guy who delivered it. I guess if he was an arse licker he might report it. If it was an arse licker that sorted it in the mail centre it would be reported to mangement. but i don't know what happened to it after that cause he never asked management.

    I for one fantasize about the AFP kicking my door down for 1/2 a zip and a bong / papers. It would validate everything I have said bad about them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AFP: grow some nuts....go catch the real criminals (the ones... you know... you never will?!). But hey...sure is fun to beat up the individuals!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway! All vendors need to smarten up if they are going to do SR imo. Using the same look of mail for months is as spastic as the message replies you get from 90% of SR vendors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    finally, I work for companies who have hundreds of express post parcels and envelopes being sent daily.
