    BigBill6778 Is spot on with this. Usually you'd be able to pick it up at the post office after a certain time it all depends on what they marked on the slip.
    <br/>
    If they marked they'll re-deliver then I don't think you've got much to worry about. But being on ones toes never hurt. ;) Let us know how it works out.

    YA should be safe just they either let you retrieve it or they will reship depends if it was an express post they have to deliver then they can scan the letter verifing delivery for the sender

    Thanks for te responses guys.  Okay so the problem is I have a very demanding job and will NEVER be home when it's delivered OR be able to pick it up.  Can't I just tell them to leave it, no signature?  If they resist then that's fishy.  War do you guys thinks?  So far y'all seem like its not a threat which is relieving.

    WELL IF YOU CALL THE POSTAL OFFICE WHERE THE PARCEL IS AND HAVE THEM ALLOW SOMEONE WITH id THAT HAS THAT ADDRESS ON THERE id SAM SHIPPING ADDRESS THEY WILL ALLOW THEM TO PICK IT UP JUST EXPLAIN YOU WORK IN THE OIL FIELDS AND THEY HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO PICK IT UP THEY WILL RELEASE IT TO THEM

    The problem is I have a terribly demanding job that will never give me time to be there when delivered or pick-up from them.  Can't I just tell then to ship with no signature required?

    Read the slip they left front, back, and side to side.

    Seriously, this is a massive case of RTFM.

    RTFM?  Are you kidding?  It simply has a redelivery date.  If you read my posts I can't be there for delivery or pick up due to my job.  I needed to know if there's a way they can leave without my signature.  Which the "manual" doesn't list...

    It really has no instructions about taking it into a post office, or signing it and then letting someone else take it into the post office, or ANYTHING at all like that? 'cause if so, then I've got no advice for you. The last time I saw a slip, that's how it worked.

    I have always seemed to have been able to write note and put it on my door, giving him written consent to leave it. I guess this might be a "signature" in form, but right now I have a general message for all orders, as I get tired of dealing with attempted re-deliveries or going to the P.O... And when I do this, it seems it works. Those guys would rather just leave it than have to deal with checking it back in.
