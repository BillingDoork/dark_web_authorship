    Hi Guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm a vendor here on SR and have sold quite a bit now. Even if i would never save usernames or addresses of my customers, some order so often that i recall them when they order. First I was all like, sweet, my friend xy is ordering again. here, have my dope. for most Buyers with many transactions thats still how i handle it. But looking closer at some of them, the pigsmell is so strong that i cant ignore it anymore...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ill make it clearer with an example: I have one buyer who has bought a dozen times from me in the last 30 days only. He allways orders the smallest amount of my cheapest shit. his stats: nearly 1000 transactions, 100 vendors, only 7000€ spent in total (average of 7€ per order!!). He orders 1g on monday, then 1g on wednesday. transactions the last 30 days: 120. thats 4 transactions every fucking day....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there is nearly no way this is a normal customer. Perhaps a 1% chance its some weird freak who gets a better high by the thrill of receiving packages than with the acutal dope. 99% chance its LE Scum and we deliver them everything for a penny. They can easy analyze the whole system, learning from packaging, collecting evidence, investigating and all the other fuilthy stuff they do all day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If we step our game up it would make it way harder for LE to investigate. The rate of successful deliveries would improve since we dont reveal all our secrets, shipping styles etc. directly in their hands. We just have to filter the most obvious cases, that would make a huge difference. Sure, they can create new accounts, but acciring dropoff addresses is a huge bureaucratic effort, they cant just create new addresses. so new account, same address -&gt; gtfo

    I think you should contact the buyer and offer him your other listings that are higher in volume.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or you can make the 2g(w/e smaller listings) only for 1st/2nd time customers, so they can see that you sell valid stuff and the package will arrive. Then not sell the *sample* products to them anymore after 1/2 orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you can work it out,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All the very best to you all!

    unfortunately that would go against SR ethic. no ones stopping you from doing it yourself, but you could be accidentally targeting just a buy happy guy and of course the LEO themselves would get their hands on any such list if it were crowdsourced. This isnt just a problem with possible leo but with scammers too. We cant throw people into jeopardy just to defend against a few scammers and cops.

    Well if he's continuously ordering from you, I doubt he's LE. And if he were, he'd probably want more that 1 gram. He's already got more than enough to bust you. As long as he doesn't no who or where you are, it doesn't matter one way or the other.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He could also be a journalist/blogger. I've read several articles about journalists who've bought drugs here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How long has he been a SR member for?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's one clue:

    He might buying a bunch of digital goods. That's pretty common. Plus he's only buying grams from you so he could just be a small buyer (or broke). 7 Euros is about the price of half a gram (in the US at least). So he may have bought a bunch of digital shit and a few grams here and there. That's not that suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If he makes you uncomfortable, don't sell to him. He sounds odd, but that's the most I can say. Try talking him into a larger quantity and see what his reaction is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can always tell him that you can't ship more than one order per customer per week. I'm sure that's a pain in the ass for you anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At any rate, the information you've mentioned about him wouldn't be enough to label him a scammer. There at one point was a scam buyer (and vendor) page in the Rumor Mill section, but I haven't been in that section for a while, so I'm not sure if it's still there or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: I misssed the fact that you said dope. I thought we were talking bud. If you mean H, then he's just a common dope fiend

    I'm no vendor but the only idea I have on the subject would be, like someone already said in this thread, contact the strange buyer with something polite or say you had an issue sending to them and see what they say. Feel them out from there.

    It sometimes happens that a number of people all use the same SR account, typically because one guy got it figured out and then his buddies started giving him money to order shit for them so they didn't have to figure out SR and PGP and bitcoin and everything else, and pretty soon this one account is just booming because a whole bunch of different people are all putting their orders through it. Just a thought.

    haha sir you are greedy. Because you always have the right to cancel your order. If you are still selling to him even though you have doubts, then there is nothing more to say..
