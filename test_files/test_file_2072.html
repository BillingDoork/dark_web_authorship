    Small amounts of drugs come in envelopes right? Do i have to pay,or does seller pay for it? I live in a small apartment,there are like 10 houses but 3 residents,and i have all keys of postboxes. So if i just use a fake name + empty flat adress,will it work? I can pick it up from their box. Or does buyer pay for the shipping?
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Most vendors will charge you for shipping because it cost them money to buy packaging materials and pay for the shipping itself.  Many offer free shipping though, perhaps as an incentive for you to buy from them, or they can just afford it cuz the profit they're making trumps the shipping cost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whose mailbox it ends up in is irrelevant aside from the security aspect of having packages sent to an address that's not your own and the increased risks involved (and from that the increased number of reship's/refunds the vendor has to make).

    Shipping depends on the vendors.  Some choose charge some dont. Your best but is to always get more coins then you really need incase you need to pay shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also i'm not sure if that is a good idea. The post man will find it a bit strange if no other mail is being shipped to the box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that helps.

    Sounds good just be careful  as that is a instant felony for checking someone else mail.
