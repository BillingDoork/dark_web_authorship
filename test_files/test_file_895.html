    The guy I usually get my stuff posted got his phone taken off him by the cops and there will be txts from me asking if the mail has arrived etc. obviously it's too risky to send to him but I'm wondering would it be dangerous posting it to my own address. Or even a neighbour. I'm talking about a half kilo of weed.  100 xtc pills ordered 3 weeks ago failed to show up but nothing about them or anything to do with post was mentioned by the cops to my mate.

    So you're:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Possibly embroiled in an investigation over drug smuggling.
    <br/>
    -Missing a package with enough pills to result in a search of your property.
    <br/>
    -Asking us how risky it is to get half a kilo of weed sent to your address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe slow the fuck down and keep a low profile for a bit?

    That son, is skoolboy shit right there. Both of yous  - him with the texts in his phone and you sending the fcuking things. Im going to assume the sim is a prepaid one and not registered in your own name, and was only ever topped up with cash? If so I think you are in the clear. If not then, well thats what you get for being low hanging fruit.
