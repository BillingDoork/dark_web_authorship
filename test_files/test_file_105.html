    I'm afraid you've come rather too late for that kind of talk here... Such information is now considered too sensitive to give up for free to any officials who are inevitably monitoring these channels, and a lot of the old heads are tired of answering similar or what they see as redundant questions of this kind. The best you can hope for is to search for and glean from some of the old threads what exists, and work backwards from negatives (unsuccessful deliveries). Similarly, if you or others do take the chance on a given vendor and it doesn't work out, please take the time to report the loss, without sensationalism or needless speculation for the benefit of others. And cease using that address. Thanks.

    Sorry about that, gotta hate how the authorities ruin everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And no losses to report was just curious as to what the odds of my theoretical gamble would be.
