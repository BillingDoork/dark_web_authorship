    I've just bought something and forgot to put my address so im going to message them with gpg
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im wondering to use a fake surname because i cant remember my friends-
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im thinking of just putting a generic- Female first name &amp; Male first name. for example:  Steve and Laura  with one of the names being real
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'm having this sent to the UK where were probably not as sophistocated as the US (in hunting for contraband, at least)
    <br/>
    do all packages that are flagged as overweight or comming from a country of drug production get checked for false names?
    <br/>
    or do all packages get scanned and matched to the house occupant and flagged if it doesnt match?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    where did the rule "use a real name" come from? or is that just to stop people putting "Professor Mick, the prick (with a big fat dick)" etc
    <br/>
    does it mean A real name, or a real name of a person living there?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Quick answers please, you can always edit later. i'm waiting to send a vendor my address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks

    It depends if the UK has a system of national registration connecting names to addresses, or if it does not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it does, use a real name. If it doesn't, use a fake name.

    The general idea behind using your real name is that if it's a stealth and secure package, a postal worker who is somewhat familiar with your address won't give it a second glance, but a suddenly different name has a marginally greater chance of being noticed.
