    I've had 2 deliveries seized recently. My cousin (Royal Mail employee) says it's probably because of tighter control of mail entering the UK during the olympics. They are working at enhanced staffing levels and heightened security. Beware.

    I hear you. I hope your address isn't flagged and you can order again safely after this shit blows over. Also hoping other Brits can update this thread with their experiences throughout this fiasco. I'll be cancelling my order even though the amount wasn't terribly big and probably still has a chance of getting through.

    Fucking Olympics. It's just one big paranoid military exercise now. You wouldn't think the event had anything whatsoever to do with sport or athletics just going by all the unnecessary drama leading up to it.

    Ordered a decent amount of blotter and pills recently (as in today). I can't really wait until the end of the Olympics with this so I hope all goes well. Will post here if anything comes up.
