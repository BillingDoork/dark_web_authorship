    I haven't been selling for very long but I notice that lots of buyers get their address wrong in some way. Once it was so messed up I spent 15 minutes trying to fix it. It wasn't in the right format.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get the impression that lots of people are sending drugs to a friend's house and don't know the proper address. It's not just completely new buyers but also people with 5+ transactions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buyers: please consult Google, Royal Mail and Wikipedia before sending your address, and I'm sure less packages will be lost as a result.

    That's gotta suck, I can't imagine not being sure of what address I'm having drugs sent to. It's like the one thing I stare at for a minute before I encrypt it, then maybe redo it to be sure. People.

    A few examples:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Australian buyer gave town name, even though it's not part of an address in Australia. Suburb name was the other way round.
    <br/>
    2) UK buyer gave a postcode that wasn't even in the same county.
    <br/>
    3) Another UK buyer who didn't know the name of the street his block of flats was on.
    <br/>
    4) US buyer didn't provide a zipcode.
    <br/>
    5) Brazilian buyer who gave all the right details but in a seemingly random order.
    <br/>
    6) Countless buyers who think name is not actually required, and don't provide it.

    That's ridiculous that people can't format their own address. Not sure how it would effect stats as I haven't had to cancel any of my own orders but if this is such a large problem you should put in all caps on your listing/vendor page that customers need to make sure the address is correct. Refuse to refund/reship orders with incorrect address information or outright cancel the order.

    I admit I have made some orders while pretty fucked up, but things like making sure your address is right? That's just fuckin hardwired in my brain man. I get some people aren't like that, but I'm the type that looks both ways before I walk into the street... Yeah literally.

    I'd send them a message telling them you're cancelling because they're too stupid to get their address right and are a risk to man and beast.  Do these dimwits encrypt the address?  If they do, how can they manage the braincell challenge of encrypting the thing if they don't even know how to write their own address?  My mind boggles.

    That was my first thought but then I realize from a vendors perspective it doesn't really matter whether the dumb ass receives his order or not, at most they might not get full payment, but likely with these types could convince them to finalize anyway.

    That's scary, it means they've never received a letter, or lived in a house that has received a letter, in their life.  With kids perhaps that's true but for adults?

    I think it probably has a lot to do with kids too.
    <br/>
    1/2 of them don't even use email now, just FB and texts... there should be a whole diagram thing for the SR wiki, explaining how addresses are used and where they go on the envelope.  Where they should put the stamp and such.
    <br/>
    Of course they should get off their asses and know how to do this stuff before they even come here, but you can't mitigate the stupidity of others.

    I do have this on my profile page, and have had it since my first day since I started my vendor account. This does not help if they do not read the vendor profile page to begin with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is my suggestion instead: Integrate it into the Silkroad User Interface where the user fills out their name, street, street number, city, state, zipcode, country, etc in a form instead of one big textarea so there is no guessing. Unfortunately this would not help with PGP-encrypted messages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perhaps someone could make a client-side utility which will make this process easier for them and be capable of PGP-encrypting the address to paste in the textarea? Or even just a javascript webpage would work which would then format it accordingly so you can paste it into your PGP/GPG program of choice in order to encrypt it.

    Obviously if they're that lazy or that reckless, it wouldn't help, but http://usps.com/zip4 is awfully useful.  Personally I just keep my address in a text file, and every order I make I PGP it and paste it on over -- quick, easy, &amp; I only had to get it right once.

      If you don't have the correct shipping format on your vendor profile, your buyers will have to depend on their own knowledge or googling ability to figure out how to receive stuff. Many of ours newbies haven't even bought something off of amazon before.

     I haven't been selling for very long but I notice that lots of buyers get their address wrong in some way. Once it was so messed up I spent 15 minutes trying to fix it. It wasn't in the right format.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I get the impression that lots of people are sending drugs to a friend's house and don't know the proper address. It's not just completely new buyers but also people with 5+ transactions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Buyers: please consult Google, Royal Mail and Wikipedia before sending your address, and I'm sure less packages will be lost as a result.

    I used to bother fixing incorrect addresses. Not I just cancel PM the buyer telling me to re-send the address correctly otherwise their order will be cancelled.
    <br/>
    If we didn't pick up on these things, it might not arrive and then the buyer would blame the vendor for it!

    Wow Sukey, that sucks! Really?! It's the buyers responsibility to get this correct, if they want to make sure they want to receive their goods they shouldn't be that lazy, no respect for the vendor.

     I do have this on my profile page, and have had it since my first day since I started my vendor account. This does not help if they do not read the vendor profile page to begin with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Here is my suggestion instead: Integrate it into the Silkroad User Interface where the user fills out their name, street, street number, city, state, zipcode, country, etc in a form instead of one big textarea so there is no guessing. Unfortunately this would not help with PGP-encrypted messages.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Perhaps someone could make a client-side utility which will make this process easier for them and be capable of PGP-encrypting the address to paste in the textarea? Or even just a javascript webpage would work which would then format it accordingly so you can paste it into your PGP/GPG program of choice in order to encrypt it.

    On each of my listings I say "please read my vendor page before ordering."

    On my vendor page is the exact way to set out addresses. A lot of buyers still fail to write it correctly...
