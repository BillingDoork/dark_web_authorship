    Found this on a Google News search, this happened in Columbus, Ohio. Just goes to show that postal workers do steal our mail. Glad he got caught.

    Postal worker arrested, charged with mail theft
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A postal worker has been charged with stealing mail after investigators found him with 65 first-class letters stuffed in his underwear and six in his socks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Terrence R. McLean, 37, of 1161 Whitney Lane, Westerville, was charged on Monday in U.S. District Court with mail theft by an employee and assaulting officers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dustin L. Rambacher, a special agent for the Postal Service’s inspector general’s office, said in court records that McLean was under surveillance on Thursday while he sorted mail at the postal service’s processing and distribution center, 2323 Citygate Dr.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Agents saw him separate, cut and tear open colored envelopes, remove their contents and hide them on his body, according to Rambacher’s report. McLean ran outside when two agents tried to arrest him in the building lobby. The agents reported that McLean bit them, punched them, and swung at them with a coffee mug and lunch cooler before he was handcuffed and taken to jail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The agents were treated at a nearby hospital.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A search of McLean’s body turned up 71 first-class letters, 20 gift cards and $341 in cash.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The investigation of McLean began on June 11 after a woman reported mailing a gift card to South Carolina on May 4 and later learning that it had been used two days later at a Reynoldsburg Speedway and three days after that at a Westerville Kroger store. Using surveillance video at both locations, Rambacher had postal officials identify McLean as the person who had used the gift card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth Preston Deavers ordered McLean held without bond yesterday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The maximum penalties for the offenses are five years for mail theft and 20 years for assaulting an officer, said Fred Alverson, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Columbus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since December, two postal employees and a contract worker for the Postal Service have been charged in federal court. Two were charged with embezzling money and the third with throwing mail in the trash.

    The guy was obviously a dope. First of all, what good does it do to run when they collar him? Does he think they don't know who he is and where he lives? He would be looking at only 5 years if he had not assaulted them.
