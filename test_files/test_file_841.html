    So, Ive been searching through the threads and doing a lot of reading, so please If ive missed a thread witht eh difinitive answer to this please let me know, I couldnt find it, just mixed answers and opinions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I use a 3rd party tracking service, through TOR, as well as a proxy ontop of that to connect to the 3rd party site, can I safely track my package without raising a red flag?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I keep seeing "this has been discussed to death, go do the research". But all the research revealed to me was a mixed opinion in the community.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, anyone kind enough to just put this to rest?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regards,
    <br/>

    I'm pretty sure that you're not supposed to use any kind of IP obfuscation when doing tracking. Instead, you should just check it normally. You package already has your name and address on it - why would you track it through some proxy service if you have nothing to hide (and by that I mean, have no idea of the contents, which you OF COURSE do not have)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What you should do is NOT track the package, and just wait for it to arrive. Then, if it doesn't arrive after a long time, you can use the tracking to see if anything went wrong - and possible get a refund from the vendor, with the tracking data as proof. If you really, really want to use a proxy, then at least be sure it's an IP from your own country.
