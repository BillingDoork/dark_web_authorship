    I have a half gm of coke that's been in transit for three weeks. Usually this vendor takes about 10 days. Coming from NL and probably due to Xmas. I was checking the forum and saw an interesting post with a link to a pic of a love letter from Canada Customs. It was asking permission to open a seized letter suspected of containing controlled substance. So I did a little research. This is from a document on the CBSA website:
    <br/>
    "Under subsection 99(2) of the Customs Act, a border services officer may not open any mail item that weighs 30 grams or less, unless the addressee or sender has given the authorization to do so."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So it seems that even if any of my little international shipments get seized I can tell customs to fuck off and just let them destroy my unopened letter. Only in Canada... Pretty sweet though.

    Hey this is very interesting, but I wonder if it actually precludes the police opening a package with a warrant. I'm not sure that it does. Yes, CBSA might not open it, but RCMP is not mentioned in that statement. The RCMP procedure is: get notified by CBSA of a suspicious package, if there is reasonable suspicion they can bring in a dog, if the dog identifies drugs they will get a search warrant and then open and it goes from there. Not sure if RCMP would go through that much work for something less than 30g or not, seems unlikely, but I would be cautious about thinking that international shipments under 30g are totally un-openable - I don't think that's the case.

     I think RCMP could get a warrant, but in my case, all orders are 1 gm or less, or 2-3 pills. I doubt they would go through the trouble. I agree with you completely, but feel my small time letters would be far too costly. Especially when the federal gov't is cutting 19000 staff across all departments. Still good to be cautious either way...

    They can still openÂ  mail if it tests positive for drugs from the outside. This is only done when they cant prove theirs an illegal substance from the outside. IE scan looks sketchy but dog/swab does not react.

    Hi Mito. No tracking in the order, but it did arrive on Monday. This was the 4th order from same vendor, so I didn't doubt it was sent. Everything worked itself but, just took double the usual time from NL. So far 36 orders in 3 months and all arrived.

    yeah, we have to let the canada post dudes do their work, they get overwhelmed sometimes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as long as they deliver the parcels and do not lose or steal them, we're fine.
