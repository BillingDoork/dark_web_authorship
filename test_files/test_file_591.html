    a parcel, thought to be seized 4 months ago by customs, has just turned up. no one was in so parcelforce have left it in a local post office to collect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the parcel is from China to UK and contains a bulk order. my supplier has advised he had a parcel released and delivered after 2 months once but it still seems very sketchy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if anyone has had a similar experience or can give any advice it would be much appreciated.

    If you buy stuff from china on ebay you will know it commonly takes over a month.
    <br/>
    The sellers often have charts giving the average times. Maybe a 10% chance that the parcel takes over 90 days or 3 months.

    usually packages take 3-5 working days. tracking last read awaiting customs charging, it would normally clear customs withing 2 days.

    Unlikely to be a customs trap, they wouldn't leave it at the post office, they would keep returning to your address until someone answered.

    I was thinking surface mail. You must be using airmail or something faster then.
    <br/>
    Anything non drug I have got from China has taken a minimum of 2 or 3 weeks. Often 5 or 6 weeks.
    <br/>
    I find hongkong &amp; japan to be slightly faster though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Depends on what was in it and how much as to the risk you would be taking.
    <br/>
    I would go and get it but make sure you are clean and un-bustable in every other way.

    i thought that but the house has been lying empty for months so they may have been to the door several times for all i know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    maybe this could be a last attempt?

    the parcel is 500g 4mmc.

    They might need his ID docs though. (unless PO will accept a letter addressed to you that could have been stolen from your bin).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can you not arrange a redelivery? Or just go and pick it up. Maybe the police would be called and the Post office try to stall you?

    I don't know. But OMG a half kilo of drugs is a hell of allot of drugs man!Â  Let's hope you pull this off you drugs baron! :)
