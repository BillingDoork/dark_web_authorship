    How would one take a small amount of MDMA to Vegas from a non-US country? Just want a bit for EDC in Vegas.

    How do you mail an entire package? Haha.. like when you're getting it at the hotel. Your name has to be on it, but also room number? I guess that would be a really good idea. Did you repackage it yourself as well?

    Well i called the hotel and asked them how to get sent mail to my room because my mom wanted to send me somethings i forgot and they told me exactly how to do it and most hotels on the strip have mailing centers in the hotel it was easy and yes i stealth packaged it myself with mbb bags its way safer than trying to carry on plane.

    Daaaamn! Thats sick! So for something like MDMA.. (still unsure about whether or not to get beans or powder), would you still get MMB for the package? I could probably use an envelope, or a small box. Since it's next day delivery, chances it gets looked at will be slim, I'm guessing.

    Lol dude your fine i brought a K pack thats 1000 tabs i think u will be just fine use a small express box and honestly  vac seal is fine or maybe not even either i only mainly did because i had a oz of bud with it and just make it look like a normal as possible most people that work on the strip are foreigners they dont give a fuck and they aint gonna look through your shit edc is fun bro i will be doing the same thing again this year. Lol just bring your own shit because the fags in vegas all are selling meth tabs tha have the pokeball stamp unless u catch some of the dealers that drove legit macs or pokes from cali but even then those only have at most 60mg

    I actually do have bottles of those that I never use. On some of them though, they have a stupid smell to them. plus having to sell a cap that isn't see through makes me kinda meh on behalf of the customer cuz I want them to be able to see what they're kinda getting. Im thinking maybe I'll just get pills  from xtc or someone and use those. easy to pop and theyre already concealed well in packages.
