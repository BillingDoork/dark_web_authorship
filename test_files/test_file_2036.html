    Sorry if this doesnt go here, but I'm just wondering how long , from within the U.S., it takes Priority mail?  I have shipped many times before, and it has never taken more than 3 days. If an item is in transit and being shipped in this method, should I worry?

    Whether or not someone is attempting to rip me off. Apparently wasnt sent Priority. Hell, it was marked in transit on the 13th, and just left today (20th). :/

    Just because it is in transit does not mean that it is out the door AKA in the postal system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know you think it should mean that, but it all depends on the vendor. I put my stuff in transit once the package is made up and all the postage and blah blah....its ready to go out the door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now with that said it never sits more then 24hrs from that point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ask the vendor, but relax a little too and dont worry  until it has been AT LEAST 5 business days from in transit...and even that is a little too soon to worry.

    No, the vendor told me it was on its way BEFORE I got nervous. And it was 6 days. That seems long enough to me. If someone has to lie, and then tell you 2 different times that it will come on two different dates? That to me is sloppy, period. In transit should mean just that - in transit. Not "Hey it is on my kitchen table for a few days, oops". I realize people are busy. But dont mark it in transit and then send it 6 days later. I dont even know if it is in transit, because I was refused a DCN, which is fucking stupid, imo. I know how that works, there's no "security risk". If a package is coming, if it arrives, the place of shipment will be known. And I was nice, even when I was bullshitted, more than once. Legal or not, someone should have the balls to be honest. Too much to ask? Perhaps. Obvious , stuffing of  any good reviews is obvious. Some reviews stated 2+ weeks. Wheres the excuse there? Some people need to get over themselves. if they cant handle the pressure, they shouldnt be in it.

    Sounds like someone should have read review BEFORE they ordered and got their panties bunched. If the vendor says it ships priority then 6 days is indeed too long.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Contact the vendor. Demand info or put your order into resolution. Simple as that. You seem to have your mind made up, not sure what the OP was even about then.......

    12+ pages of reviews, yeah I could have. That is my fault Im not denying it isn't. It just pisses me off that a vendor thinks its cool to mark something in transit when its clearly against the rules. Even a noob such as myself knows this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am very curious about something, maybe someone can help. I was told to expect Thursday, but that is only after I was told Wednesday a few hours before that. Now what caught my eye is that it will make it 17 days, not counting weekend, and the "resolve" becomes an option. Does that not seem sketchy? I could resolve, and I'd lose half my money, I'm thinking. You know, being the noob and my word meaning absolute shit, even though it's clear, to me anyway, that the vendor hasnt got their shit together. And before anyone gets all huffy - you were all new at some point. Im sure there were a thing or two you were not clear on.

    Doesn't sound like you are having a very good transaction with your vendor. No one is going to be sure if you are getting screwed or not except for the vendor.

    Personally, once someone lies to me I don't trust their word ever again.

    You can request an extension. I am pretty sure that it is done from within the resolve link. I do not know exactly as I am not a buyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "against the rules" - any "rules" here are liberal at best. there is another thread where someone was pissed off that a vendor would not sell to them. lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it goes to resolution the vendor would have to prove that it was delivered to you. AKA the tracking number to your door. falling short of that you would more then likely get a full refund (minus any SR fees) which we all pay for no matter what.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do end up getting ripped off start  a thread with the vendors name and your FACTUAL account of how it went down (you could do that now if you wanted) keep your emotions out of it as it makes you look less believable.
