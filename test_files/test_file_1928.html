    Apologies if this subject has already been covered. I was just wondering the safest way to buy Royal Mail Airmail stamps in the UK.  I’ve just bought one this morning but I got my fingerprints all over it!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    :( :( :(

    You can print out Airmail labels on the Royal Mail Website. Also you can print direct to a letter. That way you don't have to get your mitts all over them! :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make sure you have the right labels first if that's the option you plan to take:

    However I don't know what kind of computer record gets generated by the Royal Mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Theoretically they have a record of who you sent the package to and how much the postage was. So I'd be very careful... especially about filling in your own personal details.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At least make sure you access their Website through a Proxy.

    if you do it through their website you can be traced.
    <br/>
    Best thing is to just buy a bunch of stamps and pick up a bunch of airmail stickers from the post office, get your customs stickers here too.
    <br/>
    Get a pamphlet with the weights and prices and international zones in it, it's number is rmop1
    <br/>
    Weigh your parcel, affix suitable stamps according to weight and zone, make up bullshit for the customs sticker, and away you go :)
    <br/>
    up to 100g it's £2.70 europe and £3.30 rest of the world, but for heavier items there are more regions.

    Just one further question about buying the stamps - should I wear gloves or go on a rainy day and ask them to put them in a plastic bag for me?

    Put on a work looking uniform and put work gloves (even just thin woolen ones) and when you go in there just say you're on your lunch just trying to get some errands done real quick.  It won't arose suspicion that you're wearing gloves (im not talking vinyl/nitrie gloves) because you told them your on a brief lunch at work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So many workers go into businesses with their uniforms/protective gear on that it won't look weird to the employee at all (i'm saying this with past retail experience).

    Buy a large amount at once, in varying denominations so you can put the right amount on depending on region, the nice counter staff will put them in an envelope for you :)
    <br/>
    Either ask them for a few sheets of airmail stickers and customs stickers, or there will be a pile near the stamp machines. You can't get international stamps from the machines but it doesn't raise any flags buying stamps at a post office.

    Many thanks for all the info guys. In particular asking them to put them in an envelope sounds a great idea!

    Looks like I'll be getting lots of stamps over the weekend :D
