    What do you think you should do mate?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are 100% sure your order was shipped and it has been seized do you really think it's a good idea to use the same address again??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll leave you to ponder your options...

    Do you think the vendor forgot to ship it?  Did they give you a tracking number or anything?

    just had a similar issue.. was hoping for my medicine today from the well known vendor, but unfortunately had the 'happy' surprise of the police instead..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    not amazing for someones first 'big' (1 oz) buy ..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thankfully I had read some guidance via these forums in how to protect yourself as a buyer, which worked (change of name).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway.. it does make me think that some kind of 'SR Vendor Packaging Minimum Criteria', should be met, I dunno, I expect most vendors take extreme care, perhaps I was just unlucky, damaged package or something.. shame I can't find out, but ye, blehh, really was looking forward to that :( but kinda glad the Police didn't try arresting me (not that they would've got far with that anyway, but ye)...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @ OP - change the name, change the buyer, and if possible, change the delivery address.

    Ahah, now I can tell the full story - This is for the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's the short version - got arrested for importing drugs - later got de-arrested - got a caution (my 1st, woo, it's actually going to be rather useful) - almost made a convert of the officer in charge - customs here are corrupt (no surprise there).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Firstly, the vendor is totally legit, and I'm in contact with him about the situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some advice - false names work - if you keep up the denial.
    <br/>
    If someone lives at your place who has a past cannabis record, and they find out the name, they WILL be back (trying to arrest that person). If this happens, they will very likely try to search the persons room, and may try to seize any computers, notepads, or similar - So, try to AVOID mailing to an address where someone has a past record (preferably of any type, living in 'big brother UK' remember).
    <br/>
    Customs here stole half the oz before reporting it (as I was later told by the Officer in charge that it was £83-93 worth, and in the UK they ALWAYS overvalue smoke).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, it's picked my interest up, I talked my way out of being arrested (and well, the Officer in charge had his head screwed on right), and now I'm going to look into what went wrong. Seeing as my work involves Mail of the Royal kind, and let us say, I am Politically motivated into ending the prohibition on cannabis in the UK (coughclearcannabislawreformcough).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll be making posts about advice concerning mailing to the UK and customs over the next few weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly, so many people in the UK smoke, they really blooming well need to unite behind the same banner, then we'd bloody well be able to make a change!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Btw - Letters from other countries seem to be fine, they go through no problem.

    It's likely that they stopped it during transit, but it being a small amount they either stole it or just burnt it. Lack of resources to chase up everything.

    Again, anyone can send drugs to anyone. The cops will have to proof the person receiving the drugs is the one that ordered them. They have to proof this beyond a reasonable doubt.
