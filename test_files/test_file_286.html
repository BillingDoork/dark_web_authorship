    Okay im starting this thread partly because of my situation and for support, but also to provide others in my shoes some support.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live on the east coast and ordered from portugal through globalshipping. Ive now been waiting on my $350 parcel for 3 weeks. Im growing increasingly concerned and the worst part...even with 10 purchases and 300 dollars spent, i had to FE because of my buyer stats...i was sold on his feedback and reviews, and it may not be his fault, but im aware of at least one other person who has also been waiting 3 weeks for an item from globalshipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do want to add that globalshipping has maintained communication with me and tells me to wait it out. Im not bashing GS, just seeking some reassurance and hoping my package arrives, soon, and not in the hands of an undercover LE. I dont think the feds are coming for 50 grams of hash.
