    After all the effort I've put in to getting multiple drops, acquiring BTC, learning PGP and figuring out how to use TOR, I find it extremely frustrating to have the shitty postal service be the weak point in the process. I've yet to have a parcel not arrive, but damn the idiots at Canada Post are off their game the last few weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It makes me look stupid to the people I deal with IRL, when Xpresspost, which is a guaranteed service, is routinely taking 5-7 business days for shipping that is supposed to be guaranteed 2 or 3 days depending on where it's coming from. some of the parcels go to a major center, then out to a little town, then back to the major center, then out to me. I assume this is due to not reading the name of the town and just looking at the postal code and getting it wrong, but close.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMHO it's time to remove the union from Canada Post and let management run the place as they see fit.

    I definitely feel like unions are mostly outdated. They were meant to be a positive but they have gotten ridiculous.
