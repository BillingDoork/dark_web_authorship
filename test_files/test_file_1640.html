    Pretty sure my mail carrier took an incompetence day today (I assume the USPS gives those out like other companies give out sick days) because I've been home all day and haven't seen him drive by.  Can they really just not run the mail for a day?  I get random junk mail and shit every day but today, the day a nice package was supposed to arrive I get nothing.  So much hate...

    same shit happened to me one time. i was expecting a pack on a friday and no mail. then saturday the mail came way too early in the morning and i got some junk mail then at the normal time the pack and more junk mail showed up..never usually comes more than once.. however.. there were crazy bad storms on that friday...perhaps my mailman no is too bright in the head or is afraid of the rain??

    A good number of times when your mailman is sick, they may not have a replacement for them, so your mail route basically gets skipped that day and delayed until he/she comes back or someone fills in.  I've seen it happen dozens of times.

    I remember a month or so back I was getting a STEADY stream of junkmail shit then all of a sudden NOTHING for like two weeks. I had an order enroute from out of the country, a small order, but it was my first international order. I was so nervous that someone was holding my mail because a regular vendor that is NEVER late and I can set my watch to was like 2 days late. I got freakin' nervous as hell but it all worked out in the end. Sometimes there is nothing...sometimes they are lazy haha.
