    So I joined SR quite a while ago and decided to try it out. My first order was international and quite small, for 2 blotters of LSD. The seller had good ratings so I finalized early and waited. After weeks passed and nothing came (despite the seller insisting he'd sent it), the seller disappeared and others came forward claiming to have similar experiences. My guess was that he'd scammed me, and since nothing had arrived either way in 3 weeks, I put my paranoia aside and tried again. This time, I tried a similar order but domestically (US) and did not FE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After a week or two had passed, the seller gave me a refund and told me that somehow my package didn't arrive but he had certainly sent it. He said everyone else's packages arrived but I was the sole non-arrival, however that it wasn't ceased and I had nothing to worry about. Being paranoid, I disregarded this advice and gave up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's been about 3 months since then and nothing has happened. Mail continues to arrive as it always would, never had any controlled deliveries or love letters, and my paranoia has since subsided. I'd like to try to order again since I still have some bitcoins and there's very little supply locally of what I want, but I'm still slightly worried that somehow I'm flagged or things will go wrong again - to be fair, I was unlucky enough to be scammed in my first purchase and have my other package lost. Do you guys think it's safe or not?

    I think based on your situation. as described,  it is definitely safe to order.  You're first order you got zinged.  My guess is on your second order the vendor never sent it, and then refunded you.  So that's it right?  no other orders to date?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only concern I would have if I were you is that you have a very low number of transactions then...Did the refund on your second order go through the SR resolution center?  If so you're going to have a huge refund percentage so it's not your address being flagged that you have to worry about.  It's finding a solid vendor who's willing to do business with you based on your stats.  What substance are you looking for?  You mentioned its hard to find IRL, so that may also mean the number of SR vendors shelling it is low too.   Not to mention, with less than 5 transactions and possibly the high refund percentage, any vendor with +35 transactions can require you FE.  Some may not do that, but will make you FE with your stats..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck.

    The forums are your friend. If you were refunded and have a refund rate with no successful transactions, I would suggest making a new account before you order again, but back to the forums.... If you're looking for LSD check out the good LSD vendors list here- http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7077.0
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Same goes for any drug that you're interested in. The forums are your friend. Look for established vendors on the forums, and with good feedback on SR. Do a lot of research. Dont rush it. You will be rewarded for your patience. Good luck.

    Thanks for the help and assuaging my paranoia a bit. For some reason, my refund rate is 0% - the transaction with the person who refunded me was never finalized, so that may be why (I'm not exactly 100% sure how transactions on SR work). I'll look around and see if I can't find a solid vendor this time around.

    Thats good about your refund rate. Another couple of pointers that have helped me along the road:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -If something looks to good to be true, it probably is.
    <br/>
    -Read the vendors feedbacks. If they all seem like they were made by the same person (a lot of times the vendor himself) and the vendor is new, it could be a scam and proceed with caution.
    <br/>
    -Even established legit vendors sometimes flip and decide to cut and run so be prepared for that.
    <br/>
    -Sucks to say it, but if a vendor requires you to finalize early, dont spend more money than you would be willing to lose. It can be a gamble sometimes and again vendors could cut and run.
    <br/>
    -You are new, so you are probably going to have to finalize early, but avoid doing this if at all possible.
    <br/>
    -Get some smaller orders under your belt before ordering a sheet for instance.
    <br/>
    -If you Finalize before you receive your product you are not protected by SR and stand to lose your btc.
    <br/>
    -Research on the forums. The more you know the better your chances of having a successful transaction.
    <br/>
    -If you have questions ask the vendors or ask here on the forums. This is a great community that wants to help out fellow members.
    <br/>
    -Always be respectful to the vendors and understand that they get bombarded with questions so it may take time before they get back to you.
    <br/>
    I could go on, but half of the fun is learning this stuff for yourself. One more thing:
    <br/>
    -Have fun and enjoy. This place is really great.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace!

    Thanks again for all of the help. I realize this isn't really the section for this, but do you/does anyone know of good domestic LSD vendors? So far there has been very little I've seen listed domestically, and what little there is seems to be very overpriced/have mixed reviews. Anything to recommend?

    I was thinking about putting in an order with synaptic-http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0d0344107d
    <br/>
    <br/>
    His prices are high and he requires early finalization, but based on my research, he seems legit to me and i havent tripped on cid in a looooooong time so i would be willing to spend extra because its a rare treat for me. Gamely54 is another us domestic vendor, but his rating is a 92 which raises a red flag. Check out his profile though he has an explanation posted on his family issues-http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5e77550897
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He might be worth a shot if he doesnt require FE. Good luck and make sure to come back to the forums and post a review after your trip.  ;D

    Okay, I'm not going to be extremely detailed but just would like if someone here could get rid of my paranoia. I tried again and made a very small order (can fit in an envelope). It came within a few days, doesn't seem like anything's wrong - there's no way a controlled delivery could be prepared within a few days, right? I'm just a little concerned as there was no other mail beyond this today, which is pretty rare (I get a lot of junk) and the envelope is sealed shut with tape, which I find a bit odd. I have not opened it yet.

    If it were to be a controlled delivery, they wouldn't wait days for a personal amount that you could possibly use within the same day. I would say the maximum amount of time to worry about a controlled delivery is 24 hours. In the case of a small amount, I would worry more about just a knock or a letter. You should contact the vendor and ask if he/she sealed the envelope with tape. If you haven't opened it yet, it may actually have been taken out by a postal worker.
