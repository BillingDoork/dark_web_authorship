    Hi
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd like to discuss the available methods to ship and receive controlled products into Australia while reducing or eliminating risk if detected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd appreciate to discuss this with a seller as per my thread in the requested section about cocaine,MDMA etc.

    No, just fucking no. If you actually wish for parcels to continue coming into Australia then you will see why this is such a fucking bad idea.
    <br/>
    Your post made me register just to tell you no. Why is it that so many people don't see how posting statistics and discussing methods on a public forum is a bad idea?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sorry if you're just naive, but posts like these stink of either feds or regular people who just shouldn't be on SR without learning a metric fuckton more . Either way you shouldn't be on here, so please kindly on your bike sir and return from whenceforth you came.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fuck, there's the "Aussie buyers - your local and O/S vendor recommends" which is full of intel. I know people have been going on about what I am, but why don't others see that the less intel you give to the feds then the more man hours they actually have to put into doing things which severely drain their budget and making them cut down on resources. The more money they have to spend without getting anywhere is where they get their number and hours on cases cut. Money is always king

    I only see LEO using words like controlled in this phrasing. Look into linguistics and read lots of LEO reports and you get a general idea for how they use their words.

    Anyway, I couldn't stand by anymore and watch people being stupid. Now I've said something I feel a little better. Feel free to flame me about how I'm wrong as I shan't use this account again and couldn't really care :D
