    Hi Guys :)
    <br/>
    I've just had yet another order returned to me as "Undeliverable as addressed"
    <br/>
    The order was for 2 items and the buyer left me 1/5 for both with a comment that I can just steal peoples money because I have a good rep here.
    <br/>
    So I get a knock on my stats, 2 nasty comments in my feedback and as a result less business, just because someone can't get their own address right :(
    <br/>
    I'm lucky that I can use a genuine return address so returns actually do get back to me, but most vendors cannot do this so they never get to know why that parcel disappeared.
    <br/>
    If other vendors get the same number of bad addresses as me then this is the BIGGEST reason for non delivery, your stuff didn't get nabbed by customs most of the time, you put the wrong address on!
    <br/>
    Please guys, make sure you put the right address in the order box, success rates will soar :)

    Good to know I am not the only one here. I have to ask my customers (too often, I may say) if the address is really correct, and why the hell it is written wrong, or why the address doesn't even exist in the first place (Hurrah for address lookup services).

    I hope you re right PP,Â  but I think just being a vendor here is enough to get troubles with the law. Unless you have taken some legal advice and you re sure they can't touch you, you re taking a big risk doing that.

    Do you operate within the law as a business (local laws, tax, etc), or just sell items that are legal? Not hole-picking, just interested.

    Yeah no doubt, my first purchase I must have checked my address 10 times to make sure it was correct.

    I guess some people are just too lazy/stupid or just don't care if they get the drugs or not. My bet is on stupid.

    For domestic USA we've found that it's either the goofy name with the address, or the address fucked up for 99.9% of all undelivered parcels.Â  Which is why we tell customers to use the same name &amp; address like is used on all their bills that always get to them!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a bit ironic how someone who doesn't really want the bills, make damn sure they have the correct info on the billing address, but on a package of drugs that they want to make sure they receive, they fuck with the name or address!!!

    Love your store Pete I am a semi reg customer of yours. I am not sure you are allowed to transport Salvia to many countries. I know it's illegal in Australia anyway, so if our customs picked it up with the return address you might hear more about it. Thought you should know..

    That's not an issue of it being the wrong address - that is your competition trying to fuck you over by getting your packages returned to an invalid return address. They're hoping that you don't use your real return, and that whatever business it gets returned to opens it up and reports it to the police or whatever, so as to make it easy for them to investigate your operation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It could be a violation of certain postal services' regulations to mail the caustic chemicals that are found in test kits without proper hazardous material labels, or something. And like the guy said above, someone could order Salvia to a fake address in Australia to get the Australian police on you... they conduct hardcore surveillance on the rest of the world too.
