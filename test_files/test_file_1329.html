    Ok so i'm getting a package shipped to my house (in a box) that probably won't fit in my mailbox.. Would USPS drop it off on your doorstep if your house is down a long driveway? Or will I have to take the sketchy trip to the post office to get it?

    Hm I've seen it both ways. From what I've seen they will not open any door to leave the package inside any building. If left, it will be left on the doorstep. If not there might be a note to pick it up at the post office. Generally those have been ones I've had to sign for (but not SR related).

    Well this might be crazy, maybe not, get a bigger mailbox. Shoot for $30 at the big home improvement stores you can get a mailbox large enough to fit a priority mail large flat rate box. That's a small price to pay for simple delivery without human contact.

    A long time ago USPS would leave an oversized box on my doorstep, but now for a few years it seems like they only leave a note to pick it up.  I don't know if policy changed or what.  Maybe it's just my area.  Anyway, I really wouldn't stress about going to the post office.  They give you a note that says "go to the post office to pick up a package" so you go there and say "hi I got this note telling me to come here."  They are likely to check your ID however.  Don't stress, they are protecting against a thief taking the notice and trying to steal your package.

    Yes, yes they will, as long as your post man is not terrified of dogs or those sorts of things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember they are paid by the hour, so the longer they spend on their route, the better for them. I had a post guy once who refused to come near my house because of the viscious dog. He often left large packages next to the mail box... which I'm so glad they were never stolen. The dog died one day and the mail man started leaving them by the front door. Really it's his own choice. I don't think they are supposed to leave them next to your mailbox if it doesn't fit, it is probably against their policy, but I don't think it breaks any laws.

    They have always left my packages at the doorstep, always. Sometimes they open the screen door and put it in between there if it fits. But yeah, never gotten one of those slips that some people mention.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if they do leave a note, I don't think you have much to worry about. Just because you're going to the PO to pick it up doesn't mean you know the contents or were expecting it. You still have just as much plausible deniability I would think. Unless they ask you to sign for it when you pick it up, then simply decline. Simple as that  :) Then again, now that I think about it, that might seem a little weird or sketchy to them, haha. But fuck it, it's not like it's illegal, if you don't wanna sign you don't have to sign.

    Nearly all of the Express packages delivered to my house are left in a vestibule, which requires the postman to open a screen/storm door and then huck the package inside. This is true whether or not the item would fit in my mailbox. Other times, the packages are left in the mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The strangest ones are where they leave a note saying I can pick up the package at the PO after 4:30, and I have been home the whole time, so they either did not knock at all, or they knocked quietly and then fled. I've even seen them pull up, drop off the note and then take off without trying to deliver the item. I figure this must be because they are being graded on how quickly they cover their Express routes. In one case, they guy left the note, I went to the PO a little before 4:30 to pick it up and the counter guy said "Oh, he realized the signature was waived, so he went back and dropped it off at your house. Fortunately, it now seems to be the case that my regular mail man is delivering Express stuff in the morning and regular mail in the afternoon. I say fortunately, because we've gotten to be pretty friendly. I'm pretty sure he knows (or at least suspects) why I get a fair number of express and priority packages. But it also helps that I order a lot of legal merchandise. Also, the PO is about 150 yards from my house and I am on a first name basis with 3 out of 4 of the counter workers.

    if the po is 150yds away and you know them well, dont bother with getting a new box. that may actually raise suspicion since most people dont get a new box ever, unless the old one was damaged.

    I dont know why people are so stressed about having to go into the PO. I have a small box and my express never fit and so they always put a card in there so I just grab it and go to the counter and hand it to the lady and she hands me my letter.  I think people forget the best way to do something your not supposed to do is to act like your not doing anything wrong. Im very friendly and talkative with the ladys that work there and make a point to say more then just Hi and thanks.  I have nothing to hide, I get a lot of express packages but there are always other ones there to so its nothing odd. Ive already thought  of what I would say if I was ever asked(doubt it) or it seemed appropiate to say in a conversation.(also doubt it but maybee).  with the internet there are a lot of free lance small business type people that use the mail to and net to make money.  or theres also clubs you can join where you get cheap movies or music sent to you in the mail. or computer games, or stickers/decals etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dont think it makes any diff if you have to go in there since they know how many you get regardless whether they put it in your box or behind counter. to avoid them or act sketchy cause your soo fuckin nervous that they read it all over your face and body language.
    <br/>
    just act like a fuckin normal friendly outgoing person who is law abiding and a benifit to society. if people like you they wont think negatively of you

    That was me (scratchthis) talking about how close I am to the local PO and how I've developed reasonably friendly relationships with the people working the counter there, *not* the OP.
