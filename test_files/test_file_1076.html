    Anyone have any input on how far apart to receive orders? Should I make sure they are a few weeks apart or anything? So far I haven't. No less than a week, but no more than 2. My daughter is a shopaholic who uses my paypal account, so there are always packages coming in my name. Sometimes multiples, days in a row. Sometimes with a few weeks breaks in between. But regardless, getting packages on a regular basis in my name is not suspicious at least and I make sure I'm home to get the mail on the days I'm expecting something. Again, any advice greatly appreciated!

    This is completely my opinion (not really) so take that with a grain of salt.  The USPS (if that's what your dealing with) has so many problems right now, the associates at the package handling centers and the carriers have zero incentive to play detective.  Now your mail may be going through big hubs where there may be random dogs and/or x-rays but these are usually used for imports from other countries and to inspect suspicious packaging.  The average postman/mail handler has little interest in the numerous packages you get at your house and, at least in my case, has even engendered a little closer relationship with said mail carrier.  I talk with him all the time even though my dog wants to jump through the screen and eat him.  Now, having said all that, what are the things (in my mind) that are going to get you busted?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1-Shipments with poor stealth from lazy vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2-Vendor who does not truly destroy his/her records like they're supposed to and HE/SHE ends up taking you to jail with him/her when his/her shipments are tracked all over the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3-Stupidity on your part.  Do you really need a QP of weed or 7 oz's of coke?  Not if you're just a user so don't fall into the temptation of being greedy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, there are a lot of bigger fish to fry in the world right now.  LE may get to us eventually but for now, we're pretty safe.

    just order legal wares from amazon as often as you can. you can just look up whatever is cheap only have to spend a few dollars at a time and eventually it will seem like you just do a lot of online shopping.. which is quite common in this day &amp; age. and ya like guy above me said your postman really doesn't give a fuck.

    I would just space things out but its no exact science nor does it really matter for small personal use amounts. Just don't order 20 packages arriving on the same day. I spouse it depends if the products are likely to smell.

    If you're already getting alot of packages coming to your address I don't see any need be too concerned about making multiple orders in a week, should be fine
    <br/>
    <br/>
    personally for me I usually make one order a week but I live with people that do alot of online shopping as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alot of vendors do very 'official' looking letters/packaging so there's no need to worry too much :)

    What about express envelopes? Is getting an express envelope delivered regularly unusual? Most online shopping would be priority and boxes or bubble mailers I would think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What would be a legit reason for receiving express envelopes often?

    I actually got one of those today with my replacement Logitech earbuds cord.  I do get these and they are more infrequent but how many vendors ship in these and if they do, how many of these do you think would raise attention?  I would be much more concerned with larger packages.  Especially if they have not been professionally packaged.

    imho i think its very area or town dependent. seems like the smaller towns who's police dept. revenue
    <br/>
    depends alot on dui's and drug bust's and such they are more likely to follow up on stuff like that.
    <br/>
    but in cities where they have SO much mail daily. i dont think they notice. gotta gauge your particular
    <br/>
    postman/area etc.. but really so many people order tons of stuff on the internet it's not uncommon to
    <br/>
    get lots of packages. if you consistently start to receive random small packs from different parts of europe
    <br/>
    or otherwise then it might raise an eyebrow but still i doubt it! find a TRUSTED(may be difficult) friend who does
    <br/>
    not use SR at all and have them sent to them. that way if anything does go down they can do all the investigation they want and will come up with nothing..

    That's my thinking on it. I could be off base, but my personal opinion on it is that  I am taking a smaller risk getting it from a reputable source on The Road than to have to deal with someone I don't really know live and in-person. The guy I've been buying from delivers to the house, but he's not someone I would otherwise have at my house. Nothing personal, he's just young, one of these "yeah I got the dro, yo." kind of guys.  He makes me nervous and I think he's a risk. So, I've decided to give this route a go and see how it goes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not all that worried about the amount of packages we get, because we get a lot of them anyway. I do almost all of my shopping on Amazon or Ebay, and others in my house get packages all the time as well, so I don't consider it an increased risk as long as the vendor is following proper stealth procedure and the packages blend in with all the rest.

    If there's no reason to suspect and its a good vendor not someone just having a go I wouldn't over think it. There are a lot of reasons for a sudden influx of mail and drugs is not very high up there.

    I'm a big online shopper and a big user of the Road. I recive atleast 2 or 3 packages a week, so no, I wouldnt worry at all. these days people get tuff delivered all the time so there is nothing to worry about frequency-wise.
