    Does anyone have a list of drugs that police dogs are trained to detect?
    <br/>
    I was wondering if they are trained to not detect some pharmaceuticals, such as amphetamine, and Alprazolam, because they get shipped in the mail legally all the time.

    Its not just dogs you have to worry about now a-days bud. They have electronic sniffers now that they prod into an edge of your package to check for residue and chemical signatures of known illicit drugs.  The tech is still in its infancy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But to answer your question, dogs can be trained to find any kind of drug. Its all about what they have been trained for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most dogs that i have read about, are for coke, heroin, meth, and weed. But dogs could be trained to find say, mushrooms, E, basically anything that has a scent that the LE can train their dog's ball drive to attune to. But the chances of finding pharma's in the mail are pretty slim i'd think, as long as your not ordering massive amounts by the bottle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Amphetamines such as Adderall and Ritalin are pretty easy to send out, i've had some super stealth packaging in one order. When i opened it i was like " wait... i didnt fucking order this online.... " It had receipts for a fake purhcase online, it was wrapped accordingly to how the real item would be actually wrapped and packaged. It was great. Its just all about the vendor and how much time they invest into ensuring their packaging is stealth.

    Which vendor did you get your Ritalin from? Am trying to get some UK side but am having trouble finding vendors but if the stealth is as good as you say it on them then maybe from else where might be an option! :)

    LSD is odorless and tasteless so it's never a problem unless it's been laid down with something else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've heard you need to be careful even with this tho, as some well trained sniffers will notice that they feel something is amiss when there is NO SMELL emitting from an area (ie you've got 20g coke taking up a heap of room in your bag which has no smell cause you've 5x vacuum sealed it or whatever) so that should be noted

    Just commenting on what I know, they can not train for Psilocyben mushrooms. It has been tried by many to assist in hunting them and the dog can not tell the difference between a Psilocybe Cubensis, Armillaria mellea, Agaricus bisporus, Chlorophyllum molybdites, or a Pleurotus ostreatus. It has been tried with both fresh and dry samples so there is no chance of a dog catching a shipment of mushrooms.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless the shipper is stupid enough to smoke a J while packaging them. lol

    How do dogs differentiate between substances/things though? Cause the variety of e.g. cannabis smells is quite wide... Say a South African dog gets trained to search for Durban Poison (a landrace) and it comes across some US-engineered hydro weed - would it recognize them to be the same "thing" its trainer rewards it for? I'm sure our canine friends categorize things quite differently than we do.

    Its not so much that dogs are trained to detect strains, think of it this way.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can smell bbq across the street coming from a neighbors house...You dont know exactly what they are cooking, but its BBQ regardless, it has all the signs of being BBQ.
    <br/>
    The same applies with dogs. Basically, sniffer dogs are trained by a thing called a " Ball Drive " LE use dogs with a intense ball drive, meaning they have a natural hunting instinct for their favorite toy.
    <br/>
    LE will scent the ball or toy in the  drugs scent ( not necessarily the drug itself, but something with a key scent component, or chemical. ) So, now this dog will have a major urge to find their ball or toy that they know has a certain scent. ( They believe the drugs they sniff and find, are their ball )

    Would a dog really think its ball is inside a 2mm thick letter? I assumed they taught them the scents to look out for and the ball was a reward for finding them.

    Clicker training works just as good as a ball. To see how well it works get a clicker at the pet shop and train your own dog to sniff out weed. Follow any standard clicker training manual and start hiding your stash and having him find it.  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are some advantages to this,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    #1 you can use him to see how well your packaging is working.
    <br/>
    #2 You can take him to the park and he will locate people who have weed. Find new dealers and friends.  :o
    <br/>
    #3 when at the park, if he goes for a good looking lady, you can always tell her that he is trained to sniff out weed and ask if she would like to slip off and share a J  ;D

    Yes, its all about the ball drive with sniffer dogs. They've been trained to find their ball that is scented like drugs. the trainers hide the ball in these training courses, so the dog is use to having to search for his ball. It really makes sense if you think about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The sniffer dog has this incredible need to find his toy, its been instilled in his brain by the trainer. The dog has this mentality of " find my ball, get rewarded " Its a very smart process, when i was 17, my mom was dating a LEO, who worked with sniffer dogs on occasion and he knew i smoked alot of weed, an one day we kinda got to talking and he explained all this to me. Its really a cool process.
