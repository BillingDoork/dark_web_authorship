     Over the course of a single day, the U.S. Postal Service handles 550 million pieces of mail nationwide. Inside those packages, birthday cards and bills, college applications, letters to loved ones and illegal drugs. Those drugs end up in our community.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It doesn't want to be a drug courier, but it happens. The U.S. Postal Service is seeing an increase in the number of people trying to mail illegal drugs. But there's also an increase in the number of people being caught too.  From 2006 to 2011, nationwide there was a 371% jump in the number of people sending packages with illegal drugs inside.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     News10NBC's Janet Lomax sat down with a man whose job is to catch these criminals. She wanted to know how many of them are trying to use the U.S. Mail to deliver drugs in our area.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sam” is a U.S. Postal inspector, a gun toting federal agent who is part of the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sam” said, “In some cases, the public isn't aware of what we do or that we exist.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The public may not be aware, but criminals are, people who use the U.S. Mail to send illegal narcotics. News10NBC is protecting “Sam's” identity. We aren't showing his face because he comes face-to-face with the men and women caught. News10NBC is just calling him "Sam”.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lomax asked, “So how are people sending illegal drugs through the mail?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sam” said, “Picture frames and in and among dog food and children's toys or clothes. You name it. It's as multifaceted as the human imagination can be.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lomax asked, “Why should the general public care?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sam” said, “When it comes into our communities, from countless young lives being lost to additions to violence. I would think that would be an overwhelming reason why folks should be concerned.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As creative as drug dealers try to be, U.S.Postal inspectors are one step ahead in detecting illegal drugs in the mail. For obvious reasons, "Sam" can't tell us everything they do except to say they are trained to profile packages from the way they look right down to zip codes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sam” said, “Postal inspectors have gotten, have gained a fair amount of expertise, in being able to recognize packages.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He says, for the last two years, on average, there have been approximately 80 seizures a year of illegal drugs being sent through the U.S. Postal Service in western New York. Primarily, marijuana, cocaine, meth, heroin and prescription drugs. Most of the narcotics are coming from the west coast and southwestern states like Arizona and also Puerto Rico.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And "Sam" says on average they make between 20 and 30 arrests a year in our area, working with local, state and federal law enforcement. They're nabbing both the senders and the receivers.  Some are teenagers but "Sam" says a vast majority are adults who he says should know better.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lomax asked, “What kind of penalties would a person face?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sam” said, “Imprisonment, fines, and in some cases, the penalties are pretty steep, 20 years or more in some cases. If you engage in this kind of activity, we will investigate you aggressively. We will seek you out. You will be found and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Officials say people who try to use the U.S. Postal Service to mail illegal drugs point to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees privacy. “Sam” says no one, including a postal inspector can just open a piece of mail on a whim. There has to be a suspicion. And when there is, they go to a judge and get a search warrant.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Here are some tips for law abiding citizens: “Sam” says you can be arrested even if you didn't know illegal drugs were in a package you mailed or received. It sounds simple but postal inspectors say never accept or pick up a package for someone you don't know. If you do, you're taking a chance on meeting with a postal inspector in a way you'd rather not.

    80 seizures a year is an embarrassing number.  This whole article was just horrendously written.

    So you take an implication of more people being caught (without actually giving the number), and have that be the direct lead into saying there's more people than ever that are not caught?  The wording (and the article as whole) tries to impress upon the reader that the postal service is doing a smash-up job of things, while only including numbers which appear only to indict the postal service as being inept.  Just hilarious.

    True.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And they even have the pretense of saying they are "one step ahead", omg. They should be embarrassed by that low number, seriously; in an year they don't intercept much probably neither 1% of the packages sent in a day, where it is the "one step ahead" I cannot see.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if one thing must be said. I understand how much difficult it must be their work. It is very difficult no matter what to separate an illicit mail from a normal one when the thing is done correctly. Laws that protect the privacy either surely don't help the work of customs (luckily for us I must say  :))
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still I don't see what they have to boast around, even because much probably that number was inflated just to no look absolutely pathetic in the eyes of the readers (but now that I think about it it's possible that it can be either the contrary to make think those that send drugs by mail to be more at ease than they really are - a sort of psychological trap; you can never be 100% sure one way or the other so it's always best to not lower the guard).

    if these guys are content about seizing 80 packages a year, then I'm happy too. because that means more than 99% of all drugs that are mailed get through. and everyone seems to be happy. this is a beautiful win-win situation right here!

    there's nothing LE loves more than to get credit for large amount of seizures to DISCOURAGE people from ordering drugs, they will not fake number to make people think they can order more and get away with that so they can catch them later down the road one day...   ;D

    Thank you to the OP for posting though. A good reminder that despite being a druggie and written by most of the normal world I am still not as fucking useless as the Author of that article!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However the 80 seizures is for the Western New York area only I think. The arrests for 'our area' wherever the fuck that is so I'm reading it that those figures are for that sorting center only.. Still not very many IMO and not something I would be broadcasting to the public, that its so low, but thats just me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the question is; How much money is spent on paying, equipping, training etc this worker and his colleagues to catch out 80 fucking packages a year? They freely admit its not the big players they get as 'its sometimes teenagers but often adults who should know better' So what this master package profiling ninja nabs 1 thing every 4.5 days give or take (that's if he got them all himself) who would be payed a decent income, gets a gun, healthcare (prolly) etc etc and the best he can get is some teenagers and naughty adults!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fucking pathetic how this world prioritizes things... Catch a kid getting a G of C through the mail = CRITICAL! Making sure not one person goes hungry tonight or freezes to death cause they have no home/hope = OPTIONAL &lt;----- just an example of where the money and man man power could be refocused if(when) the new world order comes..

    It's from a TV news story. For a broadcast story, it's more in depth than I'd usually expect (which is to say, it went one past ZOMG DRUGS, ZOMBIES WILL BE DATERAPING OUR DOGS. It's not like it would be that hard to put some depth into this and to look at the other side... You know what I miss? James Burke's Connections, that was a great show. But I digress.)

    Here, I fixed it. "From 2006 to 2011, nationwide, there was a 371% jump in the number of detected packages in the USPS mailstream containing identified illegal drugs which met reporting requirements. That number does not include suspected packages that were still entered into database, the packages which were intercepted but which, for whatever reason, did not meet criteria for warrant, or packages which contained novel drugs which were too weird to identify. In addition, the number of packages intercepted containing illegal drugs does not directly correlate with the number of people sending those packages."

    <br/>
    Random responses to the above:
    <br/>
    I assume that when he lists the target shipping states, he's giving the info from the package profile, or it's misinformation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look back to the heroin-in-the-mail/Glory Hole story (sorry to quote myself). They can potentially fuck you even if you don't sign. His trial appears to be in mid June now.
    <br/>
    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112893.msg769736#msg769736
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The number of interceptions, which I take to mean packs they could actually open with warrant, cited (80) is very low, as is the number of arrests (20-30), although it's useless without ANY denominator, and I really doubt they're going to tell us how many packs are flagged for inspection. The fact that they are making arrests in 1/3 of the intercepted packs is interesting - no knowing what the issue is with the other 2/3. [Procedural issues invalidating the warrant or making the case questionable - delays and such, LEO not having time/money or the target not having seizable assets making it worthwhile, not seen as chargeable, is there a difference between packs going to houses vs boxes vs offices, quantity, waiting and building a pattern/case, etc.]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's more of concern to me: what number of parcels are flagged for inspection and get entered into database and then sent on their way, as I'm not aware of ANY requirement for warrant, etc., for that, and I don't think there's the standard to meet that there is for a mail cover.
    <br/>
    Package profiling is handy, I have no doubt, and I also am guessing USPIS doesn't use the package profile described any longer. They're going to have to change that pretty soon in their affidavits. Anyone here sending  heavily-taped-seam Express Mail packages from Bob Smithe at 123 A Street, Springfield? Didn't think so.
    <br/>
    They can pull better data from their  system, I'd guess, as far as shipping/receiving trends.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And, yes, their interviews stay remarkably similar.   I'm thinking any psyops energy goes into online efforts.

     You've Got Mail: Marijuana Shipments Skyrocket
     <br/>
     By DREW SANDHOLM
     <br/>
     Mar. 16, 2010
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Neither border crossings, nor sniffer dogs, nor extensive search efforts by authorities are keeping potheads from their appointed task: getting high.
     <br/>
     According to U.S. government officials, more marijuana is now being shipped through the U.S. Mail than in recent memory. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, whose seizures of marijuana parcels have increased by more than 400 percent since 2007, says increased seizures almost always indicate a much larger crop being shipped.
     <br/>
     "There is no better way to ship drugs right now," said San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne, whose city is one of the most popular in the country for using the mail to ship marijuana. "It's going up all the time."
     <br/>
     Drugs are often concealed inside everyday items, like computer towers, car stereo amplifiers or microwaves.
     <br/>
     Inspectors recently came across cans that appeared to be "Teasdale" canned corn. But when inspectors cracked the cans open, there wasn't corn inside. Instead, they found bags of marijuana. The smugglers heat sealed the drugs in bags, ensured the weight was the same as what was listed on the can, and used a can sealer to mask the smell.
     <br/>
     ￼
     <br/>
     The increase is a continuing trend. The total pounds of marijuana seized by inspectors, as well as the number of parcels containing the drug, have increased every fiscal year since 2005.
     <br/>
     And postal inspectors, increasingly, have their hands full. There was an 84 percent increase in the amount of marijuana seized from 2007 to 2008 and a 180 percent increase between years 2008 and 2009. Inspectors uncovered 8,453 lbs. in 2007, 15,521 lbs. in 2008, and 43,403 lbs. of marijuana in 2009. In that same period, the total number of inspectors has remained relatively constant.
     <br/>
     The U.S. Mail has always been an attractive way to ship pot, authorities say. It is seen by drug dealers as a good alternative to having someone drive a shipment cross-country, where one risks arrest and loss of product if stopped by law enforcement. However, the recent spike in marijuana mailings can also be explained by increased demand for the drug and by inspectors improving law enforcement techniques.
     <br/>
     Now, inspectors are working to determine which mailboxes are attractive targets for traffickers.
     <br/>
     Targeting 'Hot beds' for Shipping Marijuana
     <br/>
     They have become more efficient in what's known as ZIP Code targeting, said Peter R. Rendina, a postal inspector and national spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. Through the course of investigations, inspectors identified which mail centers see the most drugs. Inspectors from other geographical locations are sent to assist those mail centers until problem becomes more manageable.
     <br/>
     "Right now, we're really seeing an uptick in drugs being shipped through the southwest to destinations throughout the U.S.," said Rendina.
     <br/>
     Of the 3,621 parcels of marijuana intercepted by inspectors nationwide in 2009, 75 percent were in the border towns of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. The area is seen as a "hotbed" for using the Postal Service to transport marijuana.
     <br/>
     While post offices in the southwest region have seen the most drugs come through, other parts of the U.S. aren't immune. Last month, a New Jersey man was arrested for allegedly purchasing methamphetamine in California and mailing it to Newark, N.J. After obtaining a search warrant for the parcel, inspectors say they found 300 grams of meth inside. The case is still pending.
     <br/>
     Illegal drugs are also being shipped to the Midwest. In the rural stretches of north-central South Dakota, a woman was expecting a new television at her home in Walworth County. When a large box was delivered to her doorstep, she assumed the television had arrived. Instead of finding a television inside the box, she found three bricks of marijuana, totaling 50 lbs.
     <br/>
     "It was not what she expected," said Sheriff Duane Mohr, who believes a Mexican drug cartel sent the package to the wrong address. "It had an international post stamp on it, but they were crafty enough to print off a return address label with a Motorola logo on it just to make it look legitimate."
     <br/>
     Mohr estimates the drugs had a street value of $100,000.
     <br/>
     Why Mailing Marijuana is Attractive
     <br/>
     There are 1,614 inspectors at mail centers across the country looking for suspicious packages. Every day, they comb through the thousands of pieces of mail. Many inspectors employ the help of canine teams to locate packages containing drugs, though parcels are often packed with mustard, peanut butter, axel grease or coffee beans to cover up the drugs' odor.
     <br/>
     There is "an attraction to shipping through the mail because they think they can be anonymous," said Rendina.
     <br/>
     Rendina explained that drug cartels believe there is less risk in having a mule drop off a package at the post office, instead of driving a U-Haul full of product across the country.
     <br/>
     But arrests are happening. In 2009, 1,278 people were busted for using the mail to transport drugs.
     <br/>
     To identify potential suspects, inspectors conduct interviews, review video surveillance, and examine paper trails, like when and where the package is scanned. Inspectors also use intelligence about drug cartels and analyze drug trafficking trends, which they obtain on their own or by working with other federal law enforcement agencies, like the U.S. DEA.
     <br/>
     Inspectors offer a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of individuals shipping illegal substances through the U.S. Mail. Rendina says the reward money comes from asset forfeiture.
     <br/>
     While marijuana mailings have increased, shipments of other drugs have declined. Between fiscal years 2008 and 2009, there were fewer seizures of cocaine, heroin, opium, and methamphetamine.

    Hell your  last point is the most poignant of all. I cant begin to fathom the amount of wasted energy and expense incurred by the taxpayers than this level of incompetence. What if they applied that money and energy to helping ensure foster kids arent raped or ensuring that there is plenty of economical public transportation? wait that would be helping the people not selling them into the FOR PROFIT "justice" system, the government cant get on board with that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    80 pkgs a year? sounds like someone is napping on the job (thankfully so :) ). i saw a similar article where another inspector was bragging of seizing another laughable quantity of packages. why should anyone expect anything different from the government than mediocrity? ever been to a post office? those people are going through the motions, dead to the world. that is the one reason that the mail system works for our uses. the mountain of paperwork which would need to be processed for even investigating a package has to be huge as well. who likes paperwork? NO ONE! especially those going through the motions trying to coast into a pension from the government. just a thought.

    He's brainwashed by government propaganda.  He is doing his job that he gets paid to do and he probably believes he is doing good.  Do you wish all American soldiers get shot in the face?  The terrorism they commit is much worse than what this man is doing.  They invade other countries and kill innocent people.  They are brainwashed too.  To wish such harm on someone that doesn't honestly know what the fuck is going on and is just doing their job to support their family is very sick and twisted.

    It's 80 seizures a year through one post office most likely.  It says western New York and Sam is talking about the place where he works.  That is just one location with one postal inspector working at a time.  They are just catching really sloppy shit.  Remember, they are trying to catch these packages without being able to open them without a warrant.  That is difficult, especially if everything is done correctly.  So they are catching three packages every two weeks at this one location.  Considering they don't have any special technology and they can't open shit without a warrant, they aren't doing bad.  It's not really how good they are doing their job but how bad people are packaging their drugs.  I'm sure they are tipped off to some of the seizures too.

    correct, he implied 80 seizures in his 1 location. in the manner of tip off's, the usps offer a very large reward for information on anyone dealing with drugs in mail, no specifics on how much you have to snitch out though.

     He's brainwashed by government propaganda.  He is doing his job that he gets paid to do and he probably believes he is doing good.  Do you wish all American soldiers get shot in the face?  The terrorism they commit is much worse than what this man is doing.  They invade other countries and kill innocent people.  They are brainwashed too.  To wish such harm on someone that doesn't honestly know what the fuck is going on and is just doing their job to support their family is very sick and twisted.

    Honestly Silk Road probably has helped the USPS immensely.  I've had "workers" go in to post offices and spend tons of money on things I need to ship orders and I'm a pretty small time vendor, I can't imagine how much some of the Top vendors are helping the USPS stay afloat.
