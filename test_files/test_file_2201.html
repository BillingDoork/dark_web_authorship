    Eventually you're gonna have an order that for whatever reason, got left at the post office, or needs to be signed for.. in which case good luck getting it if its in their name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just use your real name. Or.. a variant thereof. So if your name is Steven Green, put it as Steven Greene. That way the postman won't say anything because its close enough to be a clerical error, but if the police come you can say "well that's not even my name".

    This is the best way to do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be honest everyone I know who has received drugs in the post and got convicted was stupid because they got the drugs and excitedly opened them within a few seconds which is when the police burst in. It's best to order them in some weird name, then after receiving wait a few hours before opening them.
