    I've followed the instructions/advice. Waiting for my order. It's not going to be a large package since it's nothing bulky and easily compressed. I was told it was being sent as business mail from the EU to Canada. As it's my first order and it's that anxious first timer wait I'm making sure this type of mail doesn't need to be signed for. Anyone with experience that can put a noobs mind at ease?

    The vendor you ordered from will have mnetioned whether or not you have to sign. Or there may have been an option to do so.

    Your feelings are normal for a first order.
    <br/>
    Its just mail being delivered to you so dont stress.
