    Hey guys, i am thinking to order 50 or 100 grams synthethic cannaboids from china, to the overseas
    <br/>
    from very  professional vendor, with EMC tracking system
    <br/>
    i will keep my questions simple
    <br/>
    i am thinking to order that pack from another computer to my house with to my correct name
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and i dont use my own bank accounts to getting bitcoins and signature is not neccesary in delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1-in worst case scenario, if they caught that pack, can they are gonna blame to me in this circumstances?
    <br/>
    2-How risky is 50gr or 100gr packs when passing borders?
    <br/>
    3-is there any advice, information,source and fresh links about it please tell me and send the links , i can read it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kindly Regards.

    i am in midde eastern country Silo, not in europe or usa or arabian one so it is not seems to effect this side of world atleast for now ,but if you mean that was a sign of global politics against sythethic cannaboids, than its better to be more carefully like you said.
    <br/>
    but i am still open for any other usefull info too.
    <br/>
    Thanks alot

    If you get caught with recreational drugs in the middle east then isn't the punishment extremely severe?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not many in here have experience with shipments to the middle east but I would recommend you get the package delivered to somewhere other than your own home/place of work if you decide to order.
