    Let me say 1st I DID NOT buy mine from Defycode.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recently decided to start vending and will be working with another vendor via sub-account. I decided to order these tracking stickers from a vendor here on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It WAS NOT Defycode.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After doing some thinking I decided to send out some test packages. I sent a total of three test package pairs. Each pair had one with the label and one without. Each pair were sent from different PO boxes separately. In each case the labeled packages were late by 2 days. All three were held over night in sorting facilities. In one package it appeared it had been opened and sealed but done very well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One again, I did not purchase these from Defycode. In fact, I have been thinking of ordering from him because he is a established vendor. Just wanted to throw this out there to make people aware of erring on the side of caution. I'm not sure what happened to the labeled packages previously ordered but I know I won't be using them.....

    @Hell_On_Heels: Good disclaimer at the beginning, and PS, not a "he" lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since we don't know all the variables it could have been anything that caused your problem. But I can assure my labels are not compromised. In general anything less than priority tends to get abused a bit by the postal system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Btw: I just added the option to buy them individually at 50 cents (+ SR fees) per label with shipping set at $3/$5 (First Class/Priority) and here is that link: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c180dabf78

    when you order a roll of tracking numbers they are linked to eachother, if you buy a roll off a guy and one of his other customers package gets intercepted its trivial for them to flag the rest of the tracking numbers for closer inspection. chances are this is what happened to you, someone already got intercepted and now they were looking at the roll. also this is really stupid for a couple of other reasons: buying them through a drug site labels you as a drug dealer, and youre giving your address to a stranger, this goes against the whole design of the site. And the person selling them is putting his ass on the line so when the cops go knocking, cause the only way to get these is to order them online which gives away your name and address,Â  theres always the chance he gets into shit probably being involved in drugs too and begins working with the police, who then are watching who he's selling to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    yeah, gl with that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you want tracking use clicknship for business from a public hotspot and slap stamps on the label.
