    Hey guys, I just found out about silk road and whatnot; just wondering how much safer it is to order bulk (~100g at a time) mdma from within the US than international (most likely germany). For those who have ordered from both the US and germany/europe, is the german mdma consistently better than the US's? And what is the best way to receive the order? I don't plan on sending it to my home address as it is bulk. Help a fellow user out? :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S. Silk road has been down for me; any idea when it'll be back up, if at all? If it stays down for a long time, I might end up trying out black market reloaded...anyone got experience with that?

    start small work your way up... silly to order such large qty's straight off the bat.

    Yeah I plan on starting out with a couple smaller purchases and working my way up; silk road is back up again (yeahhh!!) and I'm thinking that I'll just buy domestically. But do you have any tips on how to safely receive the shipment? From what I've read, all I really need to do is have an address where there are no drugs/paraphernalia and ship it there; when it arrives, take it and leave it untouched for a couple days in case there's a sting op. Am I missing anything?
