    Long time buyer on the SR. Basically ordered a quarter p of weed and i'll try to explain the story as I saw it. Literally almost shit a brick because I know this is something to look out for and I had to make an impulse decision on the spot as I had NO other choice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So basically I was standing on my porch smoking a cigarette watching the mailman on the other side of the street dropping mail off waiting for my express parcel peacefully. In what seemed like an eternity, the mailman gradually made his way on on my side of the street. As I stand there watching waiting in anticipation as he's 2 houses down out of nowhere comes a USPS minivan further parking parallel to my house on the other side of the street. The postman walked over to the minivan and discussed something for roughly 5-7 seconds then got back in the mail vehicle stopped at my house and moved on, in-between the USPS worker getting out of his minivan and walking up to me handing me the package saying the sig was waived and handing it to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Call me crazy, but i've heard many times if a postal worker delivers your package you're having a controlled delivery. I literally stood there smoking my cigarette waiting to see if I was about to go to have a felony under my belt. Luckily, 12 hours later and everything is gravy. I am a bit sketched out and don't know really what to think about the whole situation of a USPS worker coming to drop off a box.. why couldn't the normal mailman do that?

    not all post offices offer express delivery.  they offer it for sale but that post office isn't the one who is in charge of it's delivery.  i used to live in a town like this if you sent something express they had to call a neighboring postal office and then they'd come pick it up.  when they delivered me anything express it would actually come after my normal mail was delivered by someone from the neighboring post office.   another thing that might have happened is your postal delivery worker may have decided to leave the package at the post office (thinking it needed a signature) and planned on leaving a reciept to pick it up at the postal office.  sounds like his co-worker noticed his mistake (hence him mentioning to you the sig. was waived) and made sure your package got delivered on time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    edit: by the way during a controlled delivery they don't give you overnight to destroy their evidence they will grab you the minute you accept delivery

    I've actually seen this happen in front of my old house, only with FedEx rather than USPS.  A truck delivering packages, another one drives up, drops a few off, and the original driver drops one of those transferred packages off (in this case, it was a bottle of Japanese whisky I was waiting on.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it's basically done when the delivery person leaves the sorting facility and your package arrives immediately afterwards. They then dispatch another driver in the same area who hasn't left yet to run the package over to your driver so it could be delivered that day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my conjecture on the matter... you should be fine though if LE hasn't shown up yet.

    It's because the vendor used express shipping. Use priority, much safer (way more packs are sent priority than express), and as you can tell whether we like it or not express packs get extra attention. Priority mailers are usually just as fast, if not faster. For example, if you order express and aren't there to sign for it, it gets sent back to your local post office where you must go pick it up. Let's say you're busy and have to work during the already cut post office hours...your pack could sit there for days, and the smell could permeate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Priority/First class are the way to go, bro.

    I would say to chill because you have nothing to worry about.  I used to have the same thing happen all of the time when I was ordering poppy pods.  Sometimes, the regular mailman would have the package, but more often then not, a different mailman would show up to the door and drop off the package.  I used to wait for the mailman and if he didn't have my package, I would see a USPS minivan park on the street, grab my package and bring them to me.
    <br/>
    I think they do this, so it does not slow the mailman down on certain days because it would be a burden if he had to lug some packages around in addition to his mailbag, and it would slow him down if he had to make frequent stops for packages if he has a busy route.
    <br/>
    If you are still worried, I would sit on the package a couple days without opening it, but when I have heard of Controlled Delivery's, they usually bust the recipient immediately or within a couple hours after making delivery.

    If its a controlled delivery, and the detectives are on the case, you will be busted almost immediately upon accepting the package.

    Nothing to worry about.  Express may not come via your normal carrier because the post office guarantees delivery times on it.  Looks like you saw one letter carrier showing professional courtesy to another while on the other carrier's route, or maybe the carrier who delivered your parcel was simply asking for directions from a co-worker more familiar with the area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless... Controlled deliveries are executed in order to gather more evidence.  They need a warrant to open it.  Then they need to get you to accept it.  I don't think it matter for squat whether or not you actually sign for it- verbal acceptance is probably sufficient to initiate their next warrant, which will be to search the premises indicated on the package.  The package itself, in the absence of any other evidence, isn't evidence enough to charge you, let alone convict you.  It doesn't even matter if it has your name on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The drugs will have been mostly removed and replaced with look-alikes, but the placebos will be closely watched (as in not let out of sight) to maintain a secure chain of custody.  If you are able to walk out to the box, gather your mail, walk back inside, and shut/lock the door... No one is going to be kicking it back open with a warrant in hand.  Not because of the package, anyway.  More information/sources, etc can be found by searching for the keywords contingency warrant and controlled delivery.  There are some good threads in the shipping forum..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I once had to go pick up a package at the post office for friggin' postage due...  I was going on vacation early next day, and I sure as hell didn't want my shit getting sent back to a wrong return address, so I pretty much had to go get it.  What finally prompted me to get my ass in gear and get down to my local branch were the silly and outlandish scenarios I'd come up with for why they were trying to lure me to them instead of just handing it to me and asking me to take it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using the post office to deliver drugs is nothing new, but it's the "problem" we rarely hear about because there isn't shit that can be done about it because of 1) the sheer size and scope of the US postal system and 2) the constitutional protections it provides.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Roughly 20,000,000 pieces of mail per hour on 2008!  Non-stop, constantly moving, never ending...  By an under-funded pseudo-corporation that must abide by the same rules as the rest of government.  Our deliveries, so all-consuming and highly prioritized to us, are completely invisible to the post office, perfectly camouflaged amongst an endless sea of similar packages. One little piece of mail out of hundreds of millions, even billions (in 2008 more than 2 billion pieces, IIRC)...  And since no one really pays attention to the Constitution anymore, so it really is the sheer size and scope of the post office that makes it all possible.  It would simply cost TOO MUCH MONEY in the form of equipment and/or manpower to even slow it down.
