    I ordered from Dutchanbod when he was still selling internationally before Pfer took over his business, never showed, got a partial refund. Also had a 5 gram order from Pfer refunded because his shit has hit the fan. There are a lot of rumors going around that his coke is total crap, bottom line beware of Pfer.

    I've had some from seasampino arrive in less than a week to Aus that was pretty good, definitely no complaints about quality. Would expect 1-2 weeks though as I probably got lucky.

    Going to try Drgonzo as he has a pretty good rep. Other than that it a bit of Russian roulette at the moment. Will let you know about afterhours soon.

    Needing to make the plunge and find a good seller here too... ITs so hard atm to pick. If only it was still going strong in canada :( Looking at at GlobalCocaine or Afterhour. If you guys receive from afterhour then I will place an order with them. Did you get tracking or FE?

    gonzorx : I agree but its horses for courses ......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If ur a weekend user then its alot cheaper getting a 8 a month off a reliable vendor ere a month .... (like me for example) few hundred n i have 90% success
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but if your in it to make profit u can still grab an oz of &lt;70%+ flake for 7k over ere at a .6raw/.4cut (which is good by our standards) you'll still double your money .... and you also cant sit around waiting for OS mail to come through if you plan on keeping a customer base happy
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so Id say personal use SR all the way ... otherwise find an aussie connect cause its way to risky recieving anything bulk via mail

    Sesampino fishscale or dagobert are the best imo. AfterHours is a cocksucker and has shit coke (I will say this to the day I die. Anybody who has traded with him knows he is an uneducated twat.)

    Point taken. for dealing SR is probably great. For a professional user who wants function / quantity and you aren't 18 y.o (reads: been on the blow for a decade or more) , I would rather spend 300 a gram here and actually receive it quickly . SR is half price, but also 25% worse quality than what I buy locally. So all in all *bites fist even saying this* I would still rather get coke here!

    Then you sir are lucky. Because I reckon most Aussie would argue that compared to the decent gear available via SR that the Aussie stuff is pathetic. My local guy tried some SR stuff and said "I can get you stuff like that, but it'll cost a lot more".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A lot more than it already does? No thanks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMHO it's not just the price that appeals on SR, it's the quality compared to the average downunder. Sure some people get a great local hook-up now and then, but like all good things in life they don't happen often or last.

     Then you sir are lucky. Because I reckon most Aussie would argue that compared to the decent gear available via SR that the Aussie stuff is pathetic. My local guy tried some SR stuff and said "I can get you stuff like that, but it'll cost a lot more".
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A lot more than it already does? No thanks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     IMHO it's not just the price that appeals on SR, it's the quality compared to the average downunder. Sure some people get a great local hook-up now and then, but like all good things in life they don't happen often or last.

    Hoffa, the problem with that is it is 350-400 a gram as you well know, just to break even on a sale. So why bother? Nobody on SR would buy it. I find it will be the same as the better SR coke in Australia, minus the amphetamine paste and with more caines. As for selling it, not my bag. I have busted my ass to make my money in another field (albeit dealing with toxins. technically speaking, way way more harmful and LEGAL ones...lol) . I can handle a possession charge but would lose everything with a possession with intent to supply charge.

    Folks, when surgeons are getting arrested for killing hookers by shoving cocaine rocks up their assholes...we can get good coke. not for a gram deal...not even for a ball... You need to drop a lot of money...money that c is not worth when considering the opportunity cost of quality toxins on the black market

    Thing that shits me the most, it used to be $200 (or $250 if it was a late night club hook-up through someone you didn't know and you were unlucky) - and it was soooooo much better than today's crap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then the big drought hit, everyone started getting onto smoking pipes, the coke came back but it was all of a sudden $300 or $350 if you were getting screwed.

    I just want my GEAR... .. had a few successes from a couple of diff EU vendors. One has recently stopped shipping here, and the other ( supposedly reputable ) i've had success with before, but recently looking like a no show. Not sure what is going in the last month or so, but there seems to be an increasing amount of Aussies not getting their product from EU. Going from PMs etc, it is also apparent that the issue is from different vendors. Check out all the threads.. lots of speculating going on... personal situation is that my last orders are now over 22 days and starting to really give me the shits. PMed the vendor and he agreed to reship without question... not sure what to make of this, as i said the dude is has a good rep on the Road. In so far as the Blow is concerned, i wont go back to my local guy as 1) he is a compete wanker 2) is a complete rip off 3) quality.. well, i can say that i have had better here ( in the old days and still a reasonable price ) but so far as the current status quo is concerned, i refuse to pay $400/G for a 10x jumped on product. I guess my next mission in life is to hook up with a Colombian or Peruvian girl and pimp myself out.
