    all domestic mate, one got lost in the mail, the vendor resent free of charge and they ended up coming at the same time after that, so i payed for the second. So yeah don't worry about it though a little paranoia doesn't hurt.

    I have had domestic mail not turn up in the past. VERY VERY rarely, but it does happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the extent, if this is what you are driving at, where I wouldn't offer a reship/refund if somebody claims it didn't arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, times could be changing... AFP/AusPost might be cracking down on this more and more. (way to combat prohibition idiots...)

    Aussie mail does tend to get lost, albeit rarely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A place I worked at IRL had a few disappear... but they were mailing out like 100's of envelopes a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An envelope might get misplaced in the sorting centre and then just get thrown out...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If seizures were to happen, they are building a case against the receiver and prob. won't kick your door down for a few xannie's... but multiple packages all containing illicit goods.. different story.

    I find it very unlikely they would let through drugs in order to build a case on someone over smaller amounts everynow and then. So noone has ever had a domestic order seized?

    I don't mean allowing multiple packages to be delivered. I meant multiple packages being seized, to build an importing case against the buyer.

    C.D's seem to be an American thing, but then again just look at recent raids, particularly in NSW.. SOG sure love bringing out their toys....

    In the modern countries domestic letters under a certain weight (20 grams from what I hear) never see a humans eyes until they are in the hands of your mailman as he walks up to your door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Properly sealed and flattened, with a well made envelope, and you run virtually no chance of getting caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Boxes and larger envelopes see human eyes en route to your house.

    Jesus Christ guys the Question was about any domestic mail being seized so can we stop derailing the read thread with talk of customs seizures from people importing. There is already about five threads on that. Now back to the original question:
    <br/>
    Does anybody who resides in australia ever had an order that they have ordered from AN AUSTRALIAN VENDOR BASED IN AUSTRALIA AND SENT FROM WITHIN AUSTRALIA seized/stopped/whatever you want to call it by LE or Auspost/Private Courier and not just "lost in the Mail"

    cool. it would be good to keep this thread up just in case it does start to happen, has happened in the past, or in the worst case scenario they are cracking down and it has already started.
