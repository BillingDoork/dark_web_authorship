    Ok i had a package show up that it had arrived at a facility ,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It then was processed and departed the facility
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I now check the tracking and the same day it departed the facility It Now shows its back at the same one it left being Processed again from what it says. Im gonna print it out an show you/.It  left or departed then showed up same one saying it was processing again..I  have never seen this before..Any explanation? Or thoughts? It never said 'Missent' so it was routed wrong. This same sorting center has messed up my last pack and sent it to the wrong sorting center and updated it as 'missent' before.. Now this.

    It is a bad move to post your tracking info here.

    They can corolate those dates and times and find a short list of packages that match them. Bad idea to connect any tracking information with a drug shipment on a public board(this board is public).

    go to a pay phone, either you or a trusted friend ring up regarding the where abouts of it give tracking and if they ask your name make one up and a story like your sending it to a friend as a birthday present (if they start asking questions)
    <br/>
    i have done this with previous packages no issues.  if it has been seized or anything it wouldnt have been scanned into the country.
