    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm on  a secret account. For many reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recently ordered a package of something from a new vendor, and he included tracking on the package. It says it was delivered in my area a few days ago - still no sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if it is possible for a new vendor to rig the tracking system in order to get it to show like a package has arrived - when in fact it hasn't. Maybe send a plain letter to a near by address with tracking?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thing is I'm a respected buyer, never scammed or done anyone wrong. Hell I even write a lot of reviews. I'm just shocked this happened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or could it be the USPS fault?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I never had them loose a package tho.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Idk what to do  :'(

    Call the police and ask them lol no just kidding.
    <br/>
    Did you received the trackin code yourself.
    <br/>
    Or was the vendor the only one who got it?

    It's very strange - I might ask the post what's going on. It's just a letter.

    I don't think any one can rig a tracking number...might be possible but I don't think I've ever heard or seen it being done.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However,  there has been a mistakes made by the post office that marked the package as delivered when it didn't come till the next day or it was delivered to the wrong house!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it doesn't come by regular mail time tomorrow, make sure you call the PO before they close.  At this point you should explain the situation and ask so they can contact the dumbass mail man and he can run to that house and grab it from them.

    I just had usps mark a delivery confirmation as delivered even though I never got anything.  I think it either got stolen off my stoop or the mail man fucked up somehow.  It was not an SR item or illegal.  A $10 online purchase I made that I won't miss, but still pisses me off.  I'm not having anything more delivered to my place, there are some packages I just can't afford to lose.   ;)

    try calling in off a burner and see if they'll tell you which address it was sent to. this way you can see if the vendor is trying to fuck you with the scenario you just explained

    Sup uniwiz, I can tell it's you by your typing :P. (I made weird observations, sorry :X)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless, I always wondered about vendors potentially doing this. I mean how easy is it to "act" like you sent a package to the same town with nothing in it just to prove your case with a DCN to the admins. I've actually worried about this problem for a while.

    Yes and No about rigged tracking... both scenarios work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes Scenarios:
    <br/>
    -If the domain name is not the legit UPS domain and you were just emailed a link, it's quite possible that they have full control, that's a ton of work for tricking reasons. (doubtful)
    <br/>
    -If your host file was infected redirecting the legit domain to their dummy domain. (very doubtful unless you opened some file to get your ass infected by this person)
    <br/>
    -If they worked at what ever website owns the tracking service I'm sure they can link a tracking number to a trigger a dummy page, but that's even more work, the question is why? (VERY VERY unrealistic)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, with those 3 scenarios you have the technical reason of how it's possible, just extremely unlikely.

    I just wanna add guys - after I ordered from this new vendor, he took all his listings down. He is asking me to finalize.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have perfect buyer stats, have spent thousands, and many of the greats including 3Jane, Albionessentials, FredDaBaker, and others can vouch for me. I don't pull any bullshit trying to "scam" a vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think I am going to take this into dispute - every order I've gotten on SR has arrived as expected - even the international ones. I know I typed my address right when I sent it to him, and I know my mail does not get messed up - when I order something, it arrives. I live in a small town, with a locked box too so I know it wasn't stolen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This guy is a new vendor too - to me this just adds up to a scam. He probably pulled this on a few people already - using the same trick to get people to Finalize.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, that's my opinion. I will take this to dispute if necessary, my perfect buyer record should help me with this, and some friends I made on here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for all the input guys.

    New vendors with less than 35 successful transaction or been a member for under a month, cant ask buyers to FE. You definitely need to take it to the Resolution Centre, open a dispute requesting a refund (full or partial),  detail what's happened and add any supporting documents you may have so SR Admin can make a fair decision based on the evidence they have in front of them. You might get lucky with the vendor prepared to accept your resolution proposal but if they believe it's been delivered,  it will be a decision made by SR for sure. Don't finalize the order what ever you do. If you did, you would literally feel a lot worse than you do now. Hope it gets sorted for you.  :)

    Yeah, that sounds like a rip-off if I ever heard one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As soon as a vendor removes all their listings and starts demanding finalization, something is definitely up.
