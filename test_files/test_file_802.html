    Are the USPS 400 Labels able to be used on a Priority Flat Rate box? The way I understand it is that Priority has their own tracking now that comes free, but I haven't seen a workable way to do that anonymously. But if I could use these 400 labels, I think that would work fine, but I don't want the package to look odd with that label, ya know?

    Just keep in mind they store the tracking #'s in a database along with the order info when and where you have them send you Label 400 stickers.

    Now, I overthink EVERYTHING but.. It just clicked in my head that LE could use this as a good way to catch potential vendors, or even just stop packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor thing is fairly obvious.. But they could have all their labels marked somehow that if detected in the postal system that it must be stopped/checked. I know I'm overthinking this, and that it's probably not going to happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just thought I'd point it outÂ  ;)

    This is probably true and we need to assume it is true but AFAIK there isn't any reliable source that confirms it to be true.

    I am reposting this in various tracking label threads in case it is true - sorry to be repetitive.-
    <br/>
    I was told recently that the Free tracking on priority mail is only if you buy the postage online or take the package to the counter. She claimed that even if you have the "400 labels" you have to pay $0.90 more postage for tracking if you drop in a blue box with stamps. I'm not even sure she was saying you could add the extra postage as stamps? I don't trust this information although she seemed to think she was an expert on the subject. She gave me a bunch of different bar code labels she said did not add tracking (even though they say "USPS Tracking #" in bold print) but would keep the package moving through their system faster. These labels are not #400 and do not have the little extra strip on the bottom with a copy of the tracking number to keep.
