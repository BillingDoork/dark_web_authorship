    You may get one of two things... a customs letter or a controlled delivery.

    It's either thrown out or stolen, they never send out customs letters and they aren't going to chase you up for small amounts, it's not worth the time or effort, they are after large shipments and large criminal syndicates, because that's where the money is at.

    I'm in the UK, and I had some weed seized on the way in from Spain. They just opened up the envelope and packaging inside, removed the weed, taped it all up again and sent me the empty packaging! Nothing ever came of it, so I'm pretty sure they're not interested in small amounts. Opening an empty package does make you :'( though!

    I once got one (in a fake name) for importing LSA seeds. They just removed the seeds &amp; replaced with the letter. Nothing came of it obviously.

    I know someone that got 250grams of Ketamine snagged before and just got a letter needless to say he packed up all his shit moved to a different part of town and started all up again. A lot of it depends on where its going big city vs small town, the severity of possession sched 1-5 etc, and if the local area prosecutor and  the customs agent that found it is in a bad mood that day.

    I see, thank you. About controlled delivery, what is the legal way to avoid prosecution. For example just getting a package of drugs is not an offence cause any1 could send it, they need to prove you ordered it. So would they get me in the post office or at home? I think before opening the package i am safe?

    From everything I have read, and just how I feel the whole thing would go down, If they want to get you there going to at home the post office work etc.  Putting in the man hours and resources to set up a controlled delivery simply putting "return to sender" on a item isnt going to make them say, "well he didnt accept it, lets go home and circle jerk" They will detain you and question the shit out of you. Your best bet in this situations is and mind you this is my assumptions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) shut your mouth dont mention anything other than you identification information.
    <br/>
    2) lawyer up, If your doing this kind of stuff its best to prepare for the worst and have a lawyer you already picked out and on deck who has experience with this type of stuff.
    <br/>
    3) Have a clean house, this includes illegal stuff, non illegal yet shady stuff (scales bags etc) Computers, phones, ever FB (if you talk about "getting fucked up" in messages etc delete that shit. (they can still find it if they want so its best not to mention shit online, or through text messaging.
    <br/>
    4) keep your mouth shut still. This is supper important most cases get prosecuted based on what a defendant say's if there is not much evidence.
    <br/>
    5) have a nice little cash fund already set aside to pay (lawyers, bail, random fee's from police etc)
    <br/>
    6) SHUT THE FUCK UP. again super important (they arent your friend's they may offer you a deal if you do A, B, or C but really all that is going to do is give them evidence and make you admit guilt.

    As far as I know, when it is seized the tracking does not get updated at all. It just disappears.

    You would know nothing different. either the package will never move form customs, if they tossed it out, or if its a controlled delivery it will like just like any other packaged being delivered.
