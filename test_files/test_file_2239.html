    I will be short and sweet. What are your opinions on shipping to a college campus? I am going to set up a PO box type address soon, but I was wondering which would be better. I have asked a few vendors and they all seem to think it is fine to ship to a campus, but I am just being extra cautious. I don't think personal amounts are worth getting kicked out of my university.
    <br/>

    Thanks,

    When I was in college in res, before I new about silk road, I had a an ounce of hash mailed to me, and essentially the office you get it from was closed when I saw the truck pull up, so I went to check it out and all the mail was chilling in a bin unattended outside the door. I found the one addressed to me and just took it. Anyone could of taken my package if they knew what was in it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I knew of other packages with hundreds of pills and lots of mdma which I did the drugs from and which got through fine. I doubt colleges are tighter about scanning mail than the mail system itself. But every college is different.

    Thanks for the reply! Well, do you think it would be better to just go ahead and get this mailing address, similar to a PO box, at the mom and pop postal store? Even if not, I'd have 2 addresses to choose from. That's always nice. I was going to set up the mailing address under a "business" name.

    Your University-Office of Residential Life/Housing (Something to that effect)

    With a standard letter you might be fine. However, my friend ordered a Cap-M-Quik off amazon and the mail room had actually opened it and asked him why he had it and he just said it was for vitamins and they gave it to him. But yes, they do have every right to check the mail. Once the University recieves it it is no longer in the USPS system as it has already been delivered to the destination and unlike an apartment building (some apartments also manage the mail but they would never look through packages) they deliver the package to your mailbox themselves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't risk it with Universities as every university manages mail difference. Don't assume your uni doesn't search your mail, because they have every right. Get a PO box (they are super cheap) or get a UPS store box if you want a physical address (good for amazon) for $25 a month.

    Well I went ahead and set up a PO box type address at a local mom and pop postal store. I wanted to post it on here because she made copies of my identification, my real information by the way, to put on file and then forgot and handed everything back to me. Now they have no copies of my ID's. Isn't that great? I don't think I'll have any trouble here as they are older people who don't really seem to have everything together or know what the internet is. There were literally 2 employees. They also sign for any packages. :) I think I'll be doing alright. I think I could get it to my college safely, but it's not worth the risk of them searching it, because as you said they have the right to. They pretty much hold my career future by the balls; can't risk it. Thanks for all the advice. You guys/girls, and this whole community, are great!

    I may be off here, but just because it's no longer in the possession of USPS doesn't mean the uni has the right to search your mail.

    Uni has every right to search your mail. When mail is sent to the a dorm it is sent to the University itself. Universities have different rules regarding mail just like they have their own independent police departments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They can search your package, argue the injustice of it all you want but that is just the way it is. They also have every right just to barge in your room whenever they feel like it if they think you are smoking weed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also keep in mind that even if nothing legally comes out of it you will get in trouble with your school and lose your scholarships. A small misdemeanor off campus is a lot better than a misdemeanor and getting expelled.

     Keep in mind that if you get busted, even if it's for a small amount and you just get probation, you will get kicked out of school if you have the stuff on campus. However, if the drugs are off campus, they usually won't do anything to you, unless it's some small or conservative university. You're better off getting it delivered off campus.

    As long as you are not in a religious school the worst that will happen for possession off-campus is that they will make you write a letter (or take a class if they are really huge dicks) to your student responsibility board (or whatever your school calls it) saying you learned your lesson. But yeah the city PD will inform your school. It is standard procedure.

    USPS Mail delivered to a campus mail room en masse ...technically, is no longer USPS mail and therefore no longer enjoys the protections provided by Federal Statutes.  Now if the mail carrier places each student's mail in that student's private individual box it would be a different story. Any mail box intended for the use of the PO to deliver mail is automatically deemed property of the US Mail so it would be illegal for anyone other than  the addressee to remove it.  I am assuming most on-campus university mail is delivered in bulk to the univ. mail room where it is then sorted by univ. employees.  There may remedy by local or state laws under different statutes but there isn't any Federal law that  specifically states it is a crime to open mail addressed to another.  What is illegal is taking mail not addressed to you out of its authorized depository(mailbox)with malicious intent.

    I have had items ship to university addresses in which the mail is sorted then delivered. Its actually wonderful because often packages are signed for and your address is burnt at the end of the semester/year anyways. Its always fun to get things you'd like from overseas the last week or two before you jump ship.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The trick is to 1) choose a vendor with a reputation for good packaging OR 2) do not order products that are easy to fuck up like marijuana. No one will open your mail with a few tabs of lucy in it, opiates and bud are cheaper for you to get locally, and molly is easier to hide than E pills. Also and most importantly 3) Don't give anyone a reason to go through your mail. If  someone is going through your mail it is because they suspect that you are receiving drugs in the mail. Most people don't have drugs in their letters/packages so no one will really suspect this unless you talk about it, deal drugs that you are receiving, or smoke in your room excessively. This rule falls under the "don't be a dick about it and no one will bother you" rule that will pretty much hold true for the rest of your life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are going to skip over more local options for benign and smelly drugs, I can vouch for freeside's packaging as the best bud packaging I have received thus far. You may also consider domestic hash as an easier to hide, less smelly alternative. The rumor mill is the place to find out who is a professional on here.

     The trick is to 1) choose a vendor with a reputation for good packaging OR 2) do not order products that are easy to fuck up like marijuana. No one will open your mail with a few tabs of lucy in it, opiates and bud are cheaper for you to get locally, and molly is easier to hide than E pills. Also and most importantly 3) Don't give anyone a reason to go through your mail. If  someone is going through your mail it is because they suspect that you are receiving drugs in the mail. Most people don't have drugs in their letters/packages so no one will really suspect this unless you talk about it, deal drugs that you are receiving, or smoke in your room excessively. This rule falls under the "don't be a dick about it and no one will bother you" rule that will pretty much hold true for the rest of your life.

     If you are going to skip over more local options for benign and smelly drugs, I can vouch for freeside's packaging as the best bud packaging I have received thus far. You may also consider domestic hash as an easier to hide, less smelly alternative. The rumor mill is the place to find out who is a professional on here.

    I don't know what college campus you people went to but when I was in college they obviously new what was coming to people in the mail. Perhaps, they don't have the ability to search all the mail like USPS. But let me tell you, one time I bought clothes and had them sent to me; I went to pick up the package and the lady said "there's some pretty nice shirts in here". Probably differs if you go to a public university; I don't know.
