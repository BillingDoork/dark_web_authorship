    I only order US domestic but occasionally I'll remove the filter when browsing just out of curiosity.  I guess I left it off and then ordered from a vendor not knowing they were in the UK.  I'm pissed at myself for getting sloppy and making the mistake but the vendor has been on SR almost a year with around 500 fans and 100% feedback selling one specific product.   I've had 60+ transactions on SR without an issue previously and all were domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My address was written for a domestic letter and didn't include the country.  Not sure if that added to the reason why Homeland Security-Port of Chicago ended up replacing the contents of the envelope with a "notice of removal".   It had a case number at the bottom and a hand written X next to "Schedule I or II".
    <br/>
    http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/l1.gif
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I know people who have gotten these messages over the last 5+ years for prescriptions meds and such and it seems like a "hey we took your shit but we're way too busy to fuck with you" warning but since it was Schedule I or II I am a bit concerned about getting on some list.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So now I want to go back to domestic orders only but do I need to figure out another address?  I really don't want to have to do that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does the fact that Homeland Security flagged it at Port Of Chicago mean that domestic mailings are out of that loop probably so maybe I should just lie low for a bit and then test the waters with something in a couple months?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other advice on how I should proceed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    Consider yourself lucky.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would delete the account you are using as soon as possible and start fresh with a new address as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason I say delete the account is you have provided more then enough information in your last post to identify yourself.
    <br/>

    keep safe

    Chicago is one of the two customs entry ports that bust their ass to catch everything.  They catch orders of 10 cannabis seeds on a daily bases!

    <br/>
    The whole flagging address thing doesn't work anything like people here think.  You can still receive domestic and international with no problems.  I've had over a hundred seizures so I know from experience and not some made up hypothetical idea like everyone here has. :)

    Cool thats what I figured but I wanted to be cautious.   I don't want to change what I've been doing since aside from this incident I've had 60+ transactions with only very minor mailing issues.

    'Homeland Security'.  Fuck.  I can't believe this redundant, retarded government agency still exists.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why exactly is it that they are involved in seizing small amounts of drugs through the mail?  The day they are abolished I will shed a few tears of joy for the future of this country.

    Phew, thank god. A friend actually received the same thing today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything I've read before this was that an address should be considered dead once you receive a notice of seizure.

    I'd like to think that the government is a giant bureaucracy, where ICE doesn't talk to USPS, or they are extremely inefficient at sharing info, but with computer databases these days, it could be trivial to share lists of flagged addresses. Should you use another address? I don't know. You might try shipping something to your address that looks like drugs, a bag full of baking soda or something, and see if it gets opened. DON'T order one of those parcels with drug smell on it.

    Well...
    <br/>
    I'm curious to know how the address flagging system -does- work. :)
    <br/>
    For USPIS as well as the other CBP/ICE /other TLAs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They'd be just plain stupid to not track the data, and they aren't just plain stupid. Plus I've read too many complaints, reports, indictments now where the past history of the address is cited, or the history of people associated with the address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm really curious where the data-sharing stops. I too have assumed that an intercepted address should be burned, certainly for international and a traceable address; the risk of future intercept is too high.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm completely open to education here...

    The USPS is not stupid, but they're also underfunded and overworked and in general have neither the time nor resources to maintain a detailed flagging system. That, and both the Privacy Act and the ECPA restricts the information that the USPS can disclose to other agencies without their presenting a warrant or subpoena. If you're receiving massive quantities of drugs, then yes, there's cause to worry  - at that point the Postal Inspection Service might decide it's worth it to intervene. If it's personal amounts, you'd have to be extremely unlucky to find yourself investigated. (There's a reason the USPS is still the most trusted government entity in the United States - even if that's not saying much. :)

    I have had no reservations about simultaneous orders and having as many as 6-7 incoming packages at one time.
    <br/>
    I know this is not a bright thing to do but if I order just one thing when it arrives I use it, get high and next thing I know I'm ordering 5+ more packages that same day.  Haha.  Its a vicious cycle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway I had 2 packages arrive the next day and I dumped the drugs out onto the letter from Homeland security and dug in.  I have another package or two due to arrive tomorrow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have decided to completely ignore this warning and have asked the vendor to reship.   :)   Like is too short to get stressed about the little shit.
