    Hi Im new to SR and I already bought bit coins and transfer them to my SR account so Im ready to do my first order but I have a question in the adsress window that says"Please enter your name and address as it would be written on a letter".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I need to write the address in PGP or enter the normal address and then SR will PGP my address?
    <br/>
    if not then how can I PGP my address. anyone can recommend a free software?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks.

    You encrypt your address and then copy/paste it in the box.

    Try gpg4usb it's one of the easiest.

    I am wondering about this as well, as I am on the same stage as OP.  So you add the vendors public key, check the box next to his name, write your message on the clipboard, click encrypt, then copy paste the encrypted message into a PM on SR to the vendor?  Please correct me if I'm wrong, it's a tad bit difficult to wrap my head around.

    Yes that's correct.

    <br/>
    edit: NO , you don't send it with pm, you paste it in the order page where it asks for your address.

    Awesome, thanks for the help.  Almost ready to go, just waiting for my coins to be transferred from my instawallet to SR.  Does it normally take so long?  I've been waiting for about 30 minutes.  I know people insist on just being patient, but it has me a tad worried.

    From my experience 1-2 hours. I think it waits for at least 6 confirmations  ~1 hour. But shouldn't take much longer.

    Be patient and read a lot of threads here, most of the questions you will ask or have asked are answered daily.

    As the guide I posted earlier describes, you go to the vendor's main page (eg http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/da1293a8c7) and copy the public block.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Highlight a public key in an email or forum post, right click and select "copy" to put it in your clipboard.
    <br/>
    Important: make sure you highlight the entire beginning and ending lines, with all five dashes on either side of the text:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A common mistake is to miss the first or last dash when highlighting. PGP programs won't recognize a public key block without all the dashes.
    <br/>
    After copying a public key to the clipboard and selecting Import Key -&gt; From Clipboard, you'll see some details about the key. Click OK to finish importing."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can't find that block then he doesn't use GPG and you have to send your address not encrypted, or not do business with him at all.

    No. The default key that comes with the program belongs to one of the program developers. You have to copy and paste the vendor's PGP key from their vendor page to the left-hand (editor) pane in GPG4USB, and then click on Import key, and choose Editor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor's key will then appear in the right-hand pane.  Write your address in the left hand pane, put a check in the box beside the vendor's key, and click the Encrypt button. Your encrypted address will now appear in the editor pane.

    What I don't understand though is whether you're supposed to use your real name and address as the ship to address, or someone else's name and address.
