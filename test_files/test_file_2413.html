    If it's intercepted and The Man knows it's definitely drugs, then one of two things can happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They keep it and get high as fuck.  They claim they throw it it into an incinerator, but who knows.  Anyways, they then send you a letter saying, "WHAT THE FUCK?  We found drugs in your mail!  That's pretty weird," and it ends there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if they have enough evidence that something else is going on (they've intercepted a lot of drugs going to you, or suspect you're a dealer, more than just a small personal amount, etc.), then they're going to try to deliver it to you.  This is called a controlled delivery.  The popo will send a dude to your crib dressed as a mailman and demand a signature for the package.  If you are expecting drugs, DON'T EVER SIGN FOR YOUR MAIL.  The coppas are trying to get probable cause to break into your house and fuck you.  Your signature probably isn't enough to get you in jail, but nobody likes pigs in their houses.  So if you refuse to sign for something and the mailman insists on it, chant "I know your tricks, Mistah police man!" at him until he leaves.  If you are crazy enough to sign for it and it's your drugs and they goddamned know you know it's your drugs, then thirty seconds after you close the door the 5-0 will bust in.  If you have nothing lying around, or at the very least nothing obvious tying you to Silk Road, you'll be fine.

    Keep it classy, finbin.

    Not even 30 seconds, sometimes the mail man just pulls the cuffs out of his pocket and is like "lol your fucked".
