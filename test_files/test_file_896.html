    Not entirely sure if this is the right place or not, but I'm wondering if any people living in ireland can give me some info
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How tight is irish customs  with post that arrives in ireland from international countries??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone living in ireland ordered cannabis from either europe, UK or canada or america and how did it go? would it be hard to get some
    <br/>
    weed mailed to Ireland from any of those countries or would the stealth need to be top notch??  I would buy my smoke from an irish vendor but
    <br/>
    i doubt his quality is as good as he says and his prices are a complete rip off typical with street prices here in ireland.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so can any irish lads on here who has ordered some grass internationally give me some info on how safe it is to order weed from abroad?

    I'm Irish and have gotten weed in from the dam a few times. Just make sure your buying from a vendor who has good stats and you should be fine!
    <br/>
    There is no way of really saying how tight Irish customs is but I have ordered from all over the world and have had no problems with customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only place I wouldn't order from is china, I have had a huge amount of legitimate packages from there searched for no reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Word to the wise though, Last time I ordered weed I got to say the quality wasn't great compared to the stuff you would find on the street in Ireland.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me know if you have any other questions, I don't mind helping out a fellow paddy! :D

    I've had plenty deliveries off this to Ireland. Nearing 20 now. Never had one problem ordering from here. About 3 or 4 years ago I did have a package intercepted from India off the clearweb. But thinking back now India was a poor choice of somewhere to order from. Majority of orders have been from the UK but have had some from elsewhere in Europe and the US. Haven't braved Holland tho and don't intend on chancing it either.
