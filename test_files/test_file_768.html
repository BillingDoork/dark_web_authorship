    Got an envelope today which I have been expecting from rl it is a bunch of contract papers I need to sign,Â  when I turned the envelope over to open it across where the envelope would be sealed there was a big red and white sticker saying ''Found open or damaged and officially secured''
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now call me paranoid but does this mean RM have had their reasons to suspect a package and opened it and now their just trying to cover it up by saying they found it open so stuck this sticker on or do you think they just genuinely had to reseal it as the contract papers might of fell out? I suppose the papers were squashed in there pretty tight, what does every one think ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Answer: "My sources say no"

    <br/>
    That is as good as any other answer you'll get here.

    If they want to monitor your mail they will do it in a way that is hard and likely nearly impossible to detect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The postal service of larger industrialised nations processes quite a large volume of mail. This is accomplished by automated machines. Sometimes, exactly as stated, items are posted but not well sealed. Other times machines jam, the alarm bells go off, someone unjams the machine, tapes up your letter or package and throws it in the correct bin.
