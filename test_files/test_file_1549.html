    So I know so many of you guys have tricks and secrets to shipping. I don't want LE getting those so don't think that's what I'm asking for. However, say my dog wanted to ship a 200 pack of pills to a distributor before a music event or festival. How could the little guy do that in the most basic way and not have to worry about it being confiscated and getting his lil puppy ass in trouble. This is in the same state and not more than 250 pills at a time. I know some of you guys have good ideas for something simple and reliable! thanks!

    Same state? You could get away with just throwing it in the box. USA to USA doesn't even pass through any customs and I think 99.9% of drug mail will go through just fine(with the .1% being lost mail), unless of course the package is extremely sketchy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you were smart you would buy some vitamins from the store, empty out the bottle and put your own pills in there. If you want to go the extra step super glue the lid-seal thing back on. Or you could always disguise it inside of another products or what not. Be creative. 200 pills is nothing, and domestic usa shipping never gets caught unless the package is piss poor and reaks of an odor.

    good luck--just did the same-
    <br/>
    -read the shipping thread on the forums--you can learn a lot in that discussion.
    <br/>
    make certain the contents in the container doesn't rattle while in transport--use the small priority mail box for 5.60--go pick up a few to practice with before mailing (they are free) --pack the container in crumpled magazine pages so it doesn't move around when shaken--i used herbal supplement containers, stuffed with cotton-get the square shape plastic bottles not the round plastic bottles that we are used to seeing in vitamin packages--the square containers pack perfectly in the box and are readily available--i even included a couple of bottles of legit supplements also--include a faux packing slip or order invoice if you have time and want to go the extra step--VAC seal (3x)or MBB if the contents have a 'smell', and TYPE the address label and return address--you can go to Office Depot or Staples to ship if you don't want to go to the USPS office--others do it differently and more stealthily i'm sure, and the method described above forces you to give up some if not all anonymity--however, if your packaging is 'normally' packaged 'properly' and addressed correctly, and you're not sketched out--everything will go fine--it may cost you a small bit of money to do it this way and also time, but you will sleep much better and your friends will be very happy.

    Thank you very much Jones. I appreciate that info. I've been looking into it more and more and I've got a major level of respect for these vendors.
