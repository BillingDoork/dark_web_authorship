    Realisticly, I was wondering if it is safe at all to have a drug-related package delievered to a PO box at my college? Its a small college in south dakota with about 2000 people so its not real big. I could always do a foreclosed house I am jut curious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any experience with this?

    They won't think twice - even a small school like yours probably gets 100+ packages a day and a package that gets past the postal workers will definitely make it past your school mail

    I would think about getting a postal box if you plan to receive a number of packages from overseas/international locations ( Canada/NL ) or from company return addresses in high risk states ( cali, colorado )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are caught receiving drugs at school, they will kick you out so think of that.

    A postal unit is like $30 a month, dont chance it.

    I recommend buying something legal first to get to know how the postal system at your college works. Then pills, then coke if you choose.

    I would recommend buying lots of shit online first and while using SR.  When I was at school I would buy something else online a couple days later so even if I got caught I could say I thought it was whatever I had ordered off eBay.  Don't use Amazon because Amazon packages are all the same looking so they could say you knew it wasn't what you ordered.  I wouldn't be too concerned but have a backup story about what you thought the package was.
