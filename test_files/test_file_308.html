    So I ordered from juergen about 20 days ago. On his homepage it said he would answer all mail within the next 12 hours well its been 24. I have sent him mail saying I still have yet to arrive. I have never had shipping take this long. So as of now I am just waiting for the package or for a letter from customs. And if neither of those happen I am out 100 bucks and looks like no more international shipping from me. Very disappointed as of now.

    There are many reasons your order may be delayed or not coming at all, what have others said in the forums re juergen recently? anyone else having the same problems?? also depends on what country you are in, I've had one take nearly 20 days recently and have been told by another vendor I could be looking at up to 22 days for a shipment based on other customers from my country.
