    the title says it all. I see people posting all the time refering to their "drops" and implying that they dont get packages shipped to their name. how does one do this? money isnt an issue. i can spend as much as it takes to get one. im sick of getting ordered shipped to my po box that would give me years in prison.

    if i'm making a order for myself, i'll ask a friend if i can ship it to their place, use their real name and address, and give them some of what i ordered. as an example, i received 12 tabs, so i gave my friend who i had it delivered to 3 tabs. you also need to trust the person you are doing this with, because they could easily fuck you over if they wanted to.

    It's worth pointing out: if the package gets identified as containing drugs and they pursue it, it'll still get delivered.  Doesn't matter who it got mailed to.  Doesn't matter whose name is on it.  If you're the one who ends up holding the package after it gets pulled out of the mailbox, you're the one getting arrested and charged (and probably convicted).  Deny having it shipped to you all you want -- you're still holding drugs.  Don't fool yourself into thinking they'll let you go if you convince them you're a good guy.  If it goes to trial, you might convince a jury to let you off.  But you'll need a really good lawyer who convinces the jury to acquit *even though you're obviously guilty of possession of a controlled substance*.  Getting a jury to find someone not guilty when they've been caught holding drugs in their hand is a hard thing to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There may not be nearly as much protection in an anonymous "drop location," as you think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way, I honestly don't know how often they pursue a drug package when one is found, but to err on the side of caution I personally assume it's 100% guaranteed they will.

    Police really can't do anything if they find you opening a package sent to your address.
    <br/>
    I could hate someone strongly and send a brick of cocaine to their house (massive waste of coke &amp; money) and tip the cops about how I know about someone smuggling drugs, etc.
    <br/>
    Anyone can send anyone anything in the mail - whether or not they know it's coming or not. If you have a criminal record or something, my advice would be NOT to send drugs to your own address, because if you have a large quantity that gets caught, law enforcement may look into it. Unlikely, but still a risk. If you have a clean record, it is up to you if you send it to your own address or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, I take NO risk and I have a sophisticated mailing setup going on. Works for me, but it took a while for me to figure it out. Think long and hard about possible ways to work your system - I'm  not giving mine away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, in a true democracy, all drugs would be legal. Governments around the world treat their citizens as children and criminalise and punish those who make an adult decision on whether or not to use drugs. I hope I see the day when I can legally walk up to a store and buy MDMA without any questions asked. I'm an adult. I have a brain, I have done my research and I know the facts about drugs. I choose to use them because they are no where near as bad as Governments would have us believe.

    Don't take my tone as being argumentative (as it's no doubt going to seem), but I have to disagree with you: what proof of this can you offer?  It's dangerous to tell people something like that without having direct proof it's true.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course anyone can send you something in the mail without your knowledge.  That's why they can't arrest you immediately upon intercepting the package -- it's why they do things like controlled deliveries.  They have to actually catch you doing something illegal.  For better or worse, friend, if you're holding something illegal then you're getting arrested for holding it.  Whether you intended to be or not is for the court to decide, not the police.  The cops just have to make sure they don't fuck up &amp; get it thrown out of court (as well as 'interview' you in all possible ways, including lying to you, to try and get a confession).  They can and most certainly will arrest you for receiving and opening a package that has illegal goodies in it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it were true that they can't really do anything for opening a package, then it would be impossible to ever arrest someone for receiving drugs in the mail.  Even if you opened it right in front of them.  That just can't be the case (at least in the US).

    Good point. I should have been more clear in my point. If you plan ahead and take the necessary precautions, you can protect yourself from all of that. I very much doubt they'd do a controlled delivery for anything under an ounce. I know that in Australia, if you're caught with more than 2gm speed / meth / MDMA / coke / heroin, they will arrest you for dealing, but most of the time they can't prove anything because many personal users buy in bulk to save money in the long run. I've seen lots of cases where people have ounces of coke, or 5-10 grams of crystal meth and they only ever get convicted for possession because there is lack of evidence proving they were going to sell the drug. Even if they have baggies and scales in their home, because many drug users have scales &amp; bags so they can control dosage, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't sign for a package. Make sure no (suspicious?) cars are parked near your home when checking the mail.
    <br/>
    Put it under a fake name (you can do this in Australia because names aren't linked to addresses) and write: "return to sender" on the package, don't open it and leave it a few days before opening it.
    <br/>
    Never use SR from the address you are sending to, in case they got a warrant to go through your computer. Never send anything about "getting the mail" to anyone else via text or phone calls.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This will protect you, and unless you admit you ordered the drugs, there is really no way they can prove any "(victimless) crime" has taken place.
    <br/>
    Most people who use silk road have a reasonable level of intelligence and should work out how to protect themselves. I sure have and I am very careful because I do not want to get caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, every SR user should take responsibility to protect themselves.

    Do you mean can you be reasonably sure nobody will come to take you away in cuffs because of that particular package?  Oh yeah, if you open it and you aren't in custody within the hour, I think it's almost certain you "got away with it."  If you mean leaving it in the mailbox for a few days, well... I really don't know.  There's so little factual information available when it comes to this stuff -- personally I've seen it said that they won't wait more than a few days for somebody to pick up the package, but I've also seen it said that if you don't open the thing they'll just come in after an hour to get you anyway (they just prefer the tighter case of you having opened it, but they'll arrest you one way or the other, was the point of what I'm remembering).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's about all I know.
