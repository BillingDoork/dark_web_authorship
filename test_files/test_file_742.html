    Dont let other vendors tell you there is no way to ship packages with USPS tracking anonymously. The Movement still ships packages with DCN ANONYMOUSLY! We have ways of acquiring tracking and we have been using it since USPS phased out the old tracking Jan. 27. Havent had a problem yet. If any vendor is interested in our methods we will gladly give up the info.....for a price!!

    Yeah it was what i suggested a while back, that someone buys the labels, scans them, then sells the scans and the buyer can print them off at home. Why the hell do people come on here acting like they got this godgiven idea and that everyone should have to pay for it. Srsly go fuck yourselves.

    the info we want on it? Id like one with a tracking number on it that works, that's the info I would like.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you mean using click and print with a prepaid visa/mc card, at a coffee shop or other open wifi, saving as PDF and printing them when you get home thats another story.

    tracking is generated with the label.
    <br/>
    i have just discovered a second way to generate tracking labels, 2 different types.  And unlike with my first method only receiving info actually needs to be valid.  it just makes either a full label or even a new mini label which is just tracking number and bar code.
    <br/>
    my question is if generated tracking label bar codes contain information about where the package is being shipped to?
    <br/>
    i think i will test generating tracking for one package but put the tracking bar code on a different address label and see where the package ends up.

    So you can generate them based on the address you're shipping to? Seems like it would be better off to get a bunch of normal tracking labels than to register to USPS databases your buyers information.

    not sure if your aware, but every address on every piece of mail is scanned and electronically processed.  so no matter what label, hand written or otherwise, you use the address information that the package is being shipped is in the system.
    <br/>
    like i said i'm not sure if the tracking number and address are actually linked when generated.

    I'm thinking that you are getting tracking #'s and the USPS address barcode system mixed up.  The current barcode system which incorporates both addresses into the code will be defunct shortly &amp; they are moving on up to a more sophisticated system.  Anybody can create the basic barcode for mail within Microsoft Word, but it has nothing to do with tracking it that is what you are talking about.

    no, i am well aware of the new Intelligent Mail Barcode, as well as the Intelligent Mail Package Barcodes.  and looking into generating these as well when they are made avail.
    <br/>
    there is actually a 3rd way i looked into today where you can pay for postage with tracking label with moneypak over tor,  but i still like the first ideas better...
    <br/>
    tracking numbers i can gen look like this
    <br/>
    9405 4123 9935 0001 5805 10
    <br/>
    (changed a few numbers but thats the format)

    if you have info on the new Intelligent Mail Barcodes let me know
