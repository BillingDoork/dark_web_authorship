    Do any vendors here not ship to PO Boxes? I just wonder if it raises suspicion sending a stamped package to an individuals PO Box, but I might just be being paranoid.

    It's rare for a vendor not to ship to a P.O. box, I personally wouldn't send one if it was an international order because that's the biggest red flag ever. If you really wanted a P.O. box I would get one with an actual address instead of one that just says "PO Box ###"

    And the address ones are NOT po boxes. They appear as if an apt. n whatnot, but are at the small biz post stores. Great at customer service. But then again so is plenty PO's!

    I cant tell if you're being sarcastic lol I'm just trying to figure everything out before I dick myself. The large scale  RC orders ive done have always been no problem for me with PO boxes but I know these drugs are different being they can be detected easier and what not.

    Using proper vendors it shouldn't make a difference. That's just an opinion. You have to decide if you want to walk into a place with possible cams n such or have friend do it n all that instead. I know people who receive at po's often.

    The PO Box is sounding like a better solution to my residence problem. Is it possible to put the PO Box in a fake name ? And then once you have the keys you just walk in and get your mail and no one really checks (you'll never be ID'd "But you're not James Snow!" so to speak)?

    If anything I would open the PO Box under a real name and claim ignorance when drugs arrive (and they find it). Also order some embarrassing items such as condoms or porno mags. Then they'll know you're using it for real stuff that you don't want at home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Opening it under a fake name begs for further investigation

    Most of the UPS stores and mail places offer private mail boxes. Here they check ID and take a photocopy as well as a second form of ID.  They sign for the package, they hold it in a room behind the boxes until you are ready to pick-up. Go scope them out first, none of them have cameras that I use. Look for neighboring businesses as well. Its good to get boxes where there isn't too much area where LE can set up surveillance. I'm real paranoid so any time I pickup i will drive around the entire area and look for suspicious people/vehicles until I feel comfortable. The mail centers I use are wide open and usually as 1 or 2 dork/high school looking kid working there. Wide open lay out, no back rooms.

    I'm planning on grabbing 1-2oz at a time of weed from SR (after a few smaller purchases) and plan on buying a PO box for this, can anyone tell me if that would come in a box that would fit in there or whatever? I'm going to be using a Canada Post PO box, if that makes a difference to anyone. I've personally never seen how much an oz looks like as I've always bought smaller, but it seems like it is much cheaper to buy bulk. The fact that it will be sitting in the Post Office for a while makes me a bit uneasy, but since people say not to pickup at the door and let them leave it, I'd assume the package would be a tad to big to fit between the door so he'd leave a note to come pick it up there anyway.

    I dont live in Canada, but its probably the same in the US. Get a private box, don't use a box from the postal service. They leave a notice in  your box, i don't even pickup the notice, I have someone clear that out later for me. Just go to the desk and tell them your box number.

    If you rent a box from the USPS...you are guaranteed to have a "PO Box ___" in the address.  No way around that one.  If you rent a box from any private \outfit such as say... say a UPS Store..you are sure NOT to have "PO Box__" in the address since they are NOT a Post Office.  In fact, the term --&gt; P.O. Box&lt;--  is a USPS trademark.

    The only problem is I can't find one for the life of me. I literally made an account on the forums to ask if anyone

    knows what kind of places usually have these PO boxes that aren't in the actual post office.

    So I just got a box, it's not a PO box, it has a street address. I didn't get it from UPS even though I wanted to (because you know they email you when you get mail which would have been really convenient for me). When I was there I was kind of on edge and I was asking about keys to get into the building after hours and then they asked me if I want to authorize my box to receive for other names and I said "Oh so if someone else sends mail to my box or I want to receive mail for my box it's not enough to  just send it to my box number, I need to call you and give you their name ?" Then the boss guy who I wasn't even talking to made some remark like, "We don't want drugs and money laundering." Of course his reasoning is ridiculous because as has been discussed on here a few times sending drugs to a box in a fake name is the worst tip off, plus how would you deny it if caught after you receive it ? It wasn't even addressed to you, for you to say "Oh I thought it was a letter from my aunt." I am really freaked out now though... I don't know if I want to use the box now.

     The PO Box is sounding like a better solution to my residence problem. Is it possible to put the PO Box in a fake name ? And then once you have the keys you just walk in and get your mail and no one really checks (you'll never be ID'd "But you're not James Snow!" so to speak)?
