    feedbacks are a joke on here
    <br/>
    <br/>
    seems like people are so happy when they receive that their way of thinking changes
    <br/>
    <br/>
    first thing is the stealth,there is only a few vendor out there that have a brilliant stealth but pretty much every one has good coms about it
    <br/>
    a good stealth to me is a package that can be inspected from the inside and still go through
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also people leaving a 5/5 when package took 15 days domestic comon you have to be kidding me!!
    <br/>
    i Know you re now relieved and glad to have your product but dont forget  you v been worried for about a week

    also having a good stealth practices too always needs to randomize the packages look or stealth constantly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if a package was seized or something, cant get the risk to get other orders on transit seized too for having all the shame package.

    For your safety and your vendor's you must demand excellence from them. They in turn should demand excellence from you (using PGP and such). Any vendor who takes honest criticism as an offense is someone who shouldn't be in business anyways.

    I had to question myself this week as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got a package, but instead of it being in a flat rate box, it was in an envelope.  It was good stealth, but you could feel and guess its contents if you felt long/hard enough. Not sure.

    You should leave a 5/5 if the product got there and was as advertised... You can't leave a 4/5 just because you can easily find the drugs if you open the package, if your package get opened, they will find the drugs either way, because the X-Ray it. Good stealth is when the product is well disguised and sealed in mylar or if the package looks very professional. Stamps are OK.
    <br/>
    And you shouldn't leave a 4/5 just because the USPS was slow... If you get your stuff and the package isn't alarmingly suspicious, you should leave a 5 and put what you dislike in the comment field.

    The hand-made label thing is completely arguable. The #1 priority for illicit packages is to look like legit packages. If you're an active eBay buyer and find yourself getting tons of packages with hand-made labels (I do), then it's nonsense to sweat them when they've got SR products inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, yes, stealth and feedback are kind of broken on SR. You can find dozens of previous threads on this topic. And I don't see stealth getting better until people demand that it gets better (through honest, actually critical, feedback).

    most ebay people dont handmake labels and calculate and affix stamps, thats a shitton of work, only sketchy drugdealers who are trying to get around the system do that. Paypal has an auto-label generator for your ebay orders thats cheaper and easier, no one in their right mind would use stamps for a legitimate business.

    You can speak for yourself. 80%+ of the packages I get from eBay buys (private sellers, not businesses) use hand-written labels. A printed label wouldn't make anybody suspicious, but a hand-written label would have a lot of company. In my mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Similarly, almost every vendor I see requests an address format that is *completely foreign* to how things are done here (ending in country). You never see that for domestic mail here. So I don't use it.

    There's something to be said for external package stealth - from nondescript packaging to disguises. But yeah, on any sane rating system for stealth, "internal" stealth would be figured in, and you wouldn't get more than 3/5 for something that looks fine on the outside but is a dead giveaway on the inside.

    I feel like this would work well in practice but would require there to be a greater initiative made by LE. Right now, people are still seding things via privnote and without pgp. I've even seen people discuss this site via clearnet.

    Hey slash,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We agree with everything you said. There should definitely be no leniency when it comes to stealth. Our vendor acct. makes sure to commit at least a few hours to every package. Not only is it how it is packaged, but also the return address is huge! Research must be done so that if the PO looks into the return address everything checks out. This includes finding businesses that ship USPS for the same size product as you but who don't ship enough for the postal service to recognize that your packaging doesn't match theirs. The only thing we wanted to mention is that as a buyer it is important to realize that there is a difference between receiving your product in 3 days domestic w/ decent stealth or in 5-6 days domestic with excellent stealth. We personally will take as long as we need to get it there EVERY time, and think this distinction is vital for everyone to understand  :) Following this thread for an expanded perspective  :) Thanks for bringing it to the surface.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best,
    <br/>

    This is how I feel as well. When I was looking to place my first order good stealth was very, very high on my priority list (as it should be). I ordered from 3 vendors who have all purported "excellent" stealth, but when I opened the packages there was the product, plain as day. That was not what I expected. I left 5/5 ratings because the vendors were excellent and a pleasure to deal with but I do believe that a package that is perfect on the outside yet obvious on the inside should get no more than a 4/5 on stealth, if that. Otherwise how do we differentiate between vendors who go above and beyond the others on stealth? I occasionally read about vendors where people almost throw away the package because they didn't see anything in there and thought it was junk mail. That and only that should be 5/5 stealth in my opinion, and we need a way as a community to have access to that information in a clear and concise manner. You can find vendors like that if you sift through pages and pages of forum reviews but I think that information should be front and center.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then again, I'm a newcomer, what do I know?

    i totally agree, that methods should be known and shared by all vendors who contribute. BUT, as soon as you make this information public, semi-public or restricted access the risk % will rise that the same information ends up in LEO-s hands. This will hinder everybodys work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But i think this is a thought that could be looked deeper into. In this community there are some truly genius people and i believe a solution could be found, if we put some effort to it.

    It's pretty difficult to hide ounces, QPs, pounds of bud, hundreds of pills or anything like you guys are talking about.  It also takes a very considerable amount more time to hide something to where you wouldn't find it on the inside.  That said, it will also be a personal amount and a vendor would have to charge an insanely high premium for the time it took to package it like that.  You guys are sweatin' the internal stealth of personal amounts while many people here are receiving ounces, QPs, HPs, LBs and kilograms.  Maybe vendors could put up a shipping option that costs an extra $50 for you guys that want your personal amounts to be super internally stealthy?

     It's pretty difficult to hide ounces, QPs, pounds of bud, hundreds of pills or anything like you guys are talking about.  It also takes a very considerable amount more time to hide something to where you wouldn't find it on the inside.  That said, it will also be a personal amount and a vendor would have to charge an insanely high premium for the time it took to package it like that.  You guys are sweatin' the internal stealth of personal amounts while many people here are receiving ounces, QPs, HPs, LBs and kilograms.  Maybe vendors could put up a shipping option that costs an extra $50 for you guys that want your personal amounts to be super internally stealthy?

    Agree Jack,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We send multiple lbs through the mail almost every day, with some packs being as big as 5 lbs in a go, and there is pretty much nothing we can do to disguise the product on the inside. You have to remember how bulky some products are, especially bud. That being said if they are opening your package on a domestic order they are going to rip it to shreds anyways because they have already secured a warrant to do so. 9/10 of the battle is making the package look like the 1000's of others they process ON THE OUTSIDE, as well as having your product be prepared in a smell proof way on the inside to avoid canine detection. If they have no reason to stop and look at it and the dogs are ignoring it, chances are you will be just fine :) Good discussion none the less, interesting to hear everyone's take on the matter. An educated buyer is a happy buyer!

    I think you hit the nail right on the head on this one, Slash.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The relief of finally getting your goods outway the critical points in most peoples minds.
    <br/>
    However, there is a limit to what extend I expect a vendor to spend on stealth when only ordering 1 gram of something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I agree with you, Sir.

    Sure extra stealth takes extra time and expense, but let the market decide. I've used two vendors who charge extra for "hi-stealth" delivery, and in both cases, it was worth it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Right now nobody knows who has good stealth except through (possibly bitter) experience.

    i would pay 100$ too for a stealthy shipment (when ordering bulk ofc). When ordering bulk, the person who orders puts their trust into the sellers/senders to be professional and informed about stealth. So basically, when ordering bulk you are more at risk than the sender. Thats why everyone should do their research and choose the deal partners carefully - so every package would go through and nobody gets flagged.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I urge vendors to open posting possibilities when they charge the extra packaging etc. I would pay, if the products arrives and no flages are up - no problem. Hiding and disguising items is an art and tiresome job, we all understand that, and thats why we should appreciate it more, by paying for the great job.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my 2 cents

    +1 Jack, I was about to come here to post something very similar.  Y'all know those reviews where people say they almost threw their product out?  That is fractions of a gram of a powder, or maybe a few pills, or a 10-strip of LSD.  Try pulling that off with an ounce of fresh, uncompressed buds.  We could *probably* do that, but it would be cost and time prohibitive unless we wanted to, say, wreck our beautiful buds and grind up the entire crop and vac seal it as much as possible and ship it like that.  Even then, you've still got considerably more volume than most other drugs.  Then you add in the extra packaging on top of what we're already doing, then a larger box to accommodate extra stealth, then extra postage.  Factor in the time on top of all the extra costs and Jack's $50 shipping option sounds rather generous.  If a package looks legit and has no smell, unless it has been flagged somehow (in which case you have other problems) it will go through.

    I have had crap stealth, good stealth, an then Ive had ninja stealth. It all depends on the drug an amount too like mentioned above. Any of you guys remember ILF's  MDA stealth. Very creative!!!! There are few other vendors with ninja stealth but few an far between. In all honesty if does not fit the profile it should not be opened. The problem is vendors getting busy an possibly getting residue on package an accidents like that so I think the extra $ for the peace of mind is worth it. If you buy drugs off SR you are certainly not poor cause you have to pay to get untraceable bit coins an the cost of product is a lot higher on here ect....it just convenient when you cant find what you want in real life. So yes I think that is a swell idea to pay extra for special stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone know what happens if they do inspect an find a personal amount of a schedule 1 drug....does anyone have experience with this?....will postal inspector just send love letter or will they investigate....just wondering if anyone knows...when i mean personal i mean like a gram of heroin....or mdma

    No, we just shitcanned a "best vendors for stealth" thread. That is not the way to go. Some vendors use nondescript methods but others disguise their goods. LE just needs to place one order to a vendor to find out exactly what their packaging is all about. So bad-vendor-stealth threads, no problem. Good sealant or good product quality threads, no problem. But please don't go raving about super great stealth - you're just painting a target on your favourite vendor.
