    Hey SR Community,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone know how to determine if you are expecting a Controlled Delivery? What will happen with the tracking? I have an Express International package that arrived at the PO nearby the destination address 2 days ago, but it just stopped there and still has not been sent out for delivery. It seems strange that the package made it through Customs and then all the way down to the local PO before being stopped. Does it seem like the package has been seized?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also have another Express International package that last update 3 days ago, reading that it was "Processed through ISC" and there have been no other updates since then. Express packages usually move much quicker than that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have BOTH of my packages been discovered?? Any valuable insight would be really appreciated!  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best,
    <br/>
    <br/>

    They try to make it so that you don't know or expect a controlled delivery.  I have seen vendors on here have express packages sit in US customs for two to three weeks without moving.

    Did you check the destination address to see if it was delivered?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tracking info can be wrong sometimes. If an employee doesn't do his job or forgets to scan it, it could be stuck saying one thing. I've seen all kinds of weirdness in tracking info for legal items, but always got the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not saying it's not a CD, but it would be hard to tell from the tracking info.

    Just obviously don't sign for it. Also I don't think this is very likely but my dad told me a story when a friend was ordering stuff smoke from India in the 70's. The police let the package arrive as normal, they then waited till the next day and busted the door down and caught him handling the gear. After that he said it was best not to open the package straight away to be plausibly deniable about knowledge/ownership. A lots changed since then thou..

    so all the cops need to bust you if they have the info, is for you to accept the package? You think it makes difference if it comes signature required, rather than simple?

    I am not positive, but I believe a signature is only required for express mail, and a vendor should always check the box that says "do not require a signature." If I were receiving something off SR and they asked me to sign for it, I would deny that I had ordered anything and NOT SIGN. Its a loss, but better than criminal charges. After this I assume, depending on the quantity of the package, that you would be flagged and all following packages addressed to you would be given a closer look. This is all speculation on my part, but rather be safe than sorry. Someone correct me if Im wrong

    that has been a query for me for quite a while... to sign or not to sign?

    Yes, the owner of the destination address knows not to sign for the package, if it has not arrived at this point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On another note, if the tracking number was checked on the USPS site from an IP address at a residence in another state, will USPS or the police be able to trace the location of where this tracking number was checked? I realize that I may have already made the mistake of tracking this package on the USPS site, but I am in another state and my name is not on the package? Can I get in trouble or will they even investigate into this, or will they just be focused on the person who's name is on the package? If they CAN trace my IP address or whatever and see that I checked the tracking, is there a legit way that I can change my IP address on a Mac to cover my tracks?

    I know what happens because I have seen it first hand; thankfully I was not the one picking up the package.

    Shipment: package from China

    Customs found the goods and handed them over to Department of Homeland Security.

    <br/>
    The tracking stated that the package was "inbound into customs" then it was there for like 4 days and then it said "outbound out of customs". It hit the local San Francisco PO and then the next update it was magically miles and miles away being delivered without an update. The last update said "notice left for pickup".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Word of advice, if you don't see your package going through the normal local sorting channels and marked out for delivery then your about to get a controlled delivery. Also, don't go the the post office if the last update says "notice left" and there was no local chain of custody.

    This post is incorrect. I have had packages that have said "Inbound/Outbound into customs" and packages that simply say "Processed through ICS". I have had packages not show leaving customs, and only update at my local post office. It is extremely variable. As you can see, I'm still here and I received my packs. That is not how a CD is done.

    Oh, absolutely! I think the best way to avoid a controlled delivery (aside from not ordering illegal drugs) is to be constantly aware of discrepancies or irregularities. Things like it taking longer than normal, different mail carrier, different time of day, etc. etc. are good things to watch for. I don't think there is set "standard" for a controlled delivery ---- Otherwise we would all memorize it to a T, and nobody would get caught. Local and federal police task forces likely go about an operation in several possible ways. As the saying goes, "There is more than one way to skin a cat."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My belief is the best-tell sign (Totally *opinionated*, as I do not have any experience with a CD) would be a different postal worker than you are normally accustomed to. I would be hard-pressed to believe that my regular, grey-aged mailperson would be required or even asked to perform a controlled delivery by LEO.. And even if they did, I feel like their mannerisms while performing it could easily give away their uneasiness and apprehension.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again, this is all my speculation. You really shouldn't be ordering drugs if you can't handle your door being busted down by some bullshit loophole, which I would venture to guess that they will do everything to find.

        I know what happens because I have seen it first hand; thankfully I was not the one picking up the package.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Shipment: package from China
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Point of Entry: San Francisco
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Service: EMS express and then USPS express
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Customs found the goods and handed them over to Department of Homeland Security. DHS took the package directly to the destination and swapped the goods for fake goods and tries to do a controlled signed delivery. No one was there to sign because the tracking never updated and a slip was left for pickup at the post office, You can figure out what happened next. If signature is required, which was in this particular instance there is only one way you can know.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The tracking stated that the package was "inbound into customs" then it was there for like 4 days and then it said "outbound out of customs". It hit the local San Francisco PO and then the next update it was magically miles and miles away being delivered without an update. The last update said "notice left for pickup".
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Word of advice, if you don't see your package going through the normal local sorting channels and marked out for delivery then your about to get a controlled delivery. Also, don't go the the post office if the last update says "notice left" and there was no local chain of custody.

       This post is incorrect. I have had packages that have said "Inbound/Outbound into customs" and packages that simply say "Processed through ICS". I have had packages not show leaving customs, and only update at my local post office. It is extremely variable. As you can see, I'm still here and I received my packs. That is not how a CD is done.

      Ok, I'm not here to argue. I just know what I saw with my own 2 eyes and everything that let up to it. All I'm saying is watch your local chain of custody because this is how one of my buddies went down.

     Oh, absolutely! I think the best way to avoid a controlled delivery (aside from not ordering illegal drugs) is to be constantly aware of discrepancies or irregularities. Things like it taking longer than normal, different mail carrier, different time of day, etc. etc. are good things to watch for. I don't think there is set "standard" for a controlled delivery ---- Otherwise we would all memorize it to a T, and nobody would get caught. Local and federal police task forces likely go about an operation in several possible ways. As the saying goes, "There is more than one way to skin a cat."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My belief is the best-tell sign (Totally *opinionated*, as I do not have any experience with a CD) would be a different postal worker than you are normally accustomed to. I would be hard-pressed to believe that my regular, grey-aged mailperson would be required or even asked to perform a controlled delivery by LEO.. And even if they did, I feel like their mannerisms while performing it could easily give away their uneasiness and apprehension.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Again, this is all my speculation. You really shouldn't be ordering drugs if you can't handle your door being busted down by some bullshit loophole, which I would venture to guess that they will do everything to find.

    LE will never use the normal post carrier; that is why they call it a controlled delivery; they have to have full control over it at all times.

    Standard procedure is for the postal inspector to delivery the package.

    I think police would have to do it so that the package is in their control/eyes at all time for court use, and they would not be allowed to use a citizen for police work in case something went wrong
