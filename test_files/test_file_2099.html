    How do you seasoned vendors go about this? Just print up the customers address on a plain blank paper and then calculate shipping and apply the right stamps? Or is there a better way?

    I have just printed out labels and used stamps for small first class packages.  If one were to overnight something, it would be more difficult as the costs as more.  So I guess it depends on what you mean by express...

    It's best to avoid Express shipping but if you must...ship using the flat rate envelope($18.95) or small Express flat rate box as this will save you from having to calculate postage.  The only way to be able to print out an Express label is to pay electronically(credit card/debit card, etc) for postage which obviously leaves a paper trail.  If you have a card that can't be traced back to you it's doable but I strongly discourage anyone from ever sending drugs with postage paid electronically.  SO if you must ship Express..you must use Postal Form-PS Label 11-F (Express Shipping Label)which are available at any PO.  You can fill out the form yourself, tear out customer copy..affix Express stamp or equivalent to envelope and drop in any USPS blue drop box.

    I started off by avoiding express all together, but when your in the opiate business and your customers are in withdrawals, express is something many of my buyers expect. So I have been using the method you described, flat rate envelopes, buying the stamps in person with cash, and filling out the form by hand. I was just assuming that somebody may have found a more anonymous way to approach this. I spent some time looking into the USPS click'n'ship program or whatever its called, but as you guys said it requires a lot of hurdles and flaming hoops to jump through just to remain anonymous. Didn't seem worth it.  :-\

    Yea, I have been told the same thing by other opiate sellers I've known so I def get it.  One in particular had a policy in place whereby he would oblige buyers requesting overnight UPS/FedEx service but only if they provided him with a shipping account.  This way he could drop their pkgs anonymously and not have to put himself at risk by doing F2F payment transactions.

    Express isn't even fast anymore,  priority sometimes gets there at the same time priority does for a 1/3 of the cost. I'm just going to stop offering it, if your customers are going through withdrawals that's their problem not yours.
