    Okay on friday I placed an order with Jor for some blotter. It was put into transit a couple of hours later. It is now wednesday and it hasn't arrived. This is the longest its taken for any SR package to come. It was only a small personal use amount.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Part of me figures that the letter was sent on saturday as it was placed just after the LSD packer for Jor had come back from holiday (So they were probably overwhelmed with orders). Also on Jors profile it says that after marking in transit packages are posted in 24 - 72 hours. This could mean that it was posted sunday or monday but I think this is being too hopeful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously I can't speak to Jor about it as you can only contact him through the resolution centre.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are the chances of it being seized. I have been ordering more packages this month than usual and buying more bitcoins than usual.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just can't see how it could be seized. Then again it still hasn't shown up. I'm almost certain I put in the correct address as well when ordering. Very peculiar. Another reason I'm worrying is because it was also my 13th purchase on here. Trust my 13th to go wrong right...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So am I panicking unnecessarily?
    <br/>
    Do you think it will come?
    <br/>
    If it doesn't what should I do?
    <br/>
    Will I be CD'd by the police or receive a visit or will I just get a love letter?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    unless you've ordered a whole wad of sheets don't worry about a CD. you won't get a love letter either - domestic mail doesn't have to go through customs. unless it had 'THIS CONTAINS DRUGS' slapped all over the envelope i think you're safe mate
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UK yeah? i think royal mail is taking the piss lately, been waiting over 2 weeks for an international when a lot of people say they are receiving after 5 - 6 days.

    I think you are panicking needlessly. The chances of a blotter paper in a letter getting intercepted are incredibly small IMHO. The chances of an intercepted blotter paper leading to a CD are much smaller than that. Relax. I'd suspect your package will arrive in a few days. Worrying will accomplish nothing.

    Jor is a busy guy last time I ordered he was having a 3 day shipping delay from when it was marked in transit. I imagine now with closing up shop and all he is pretty busy.

    Like coglac said, JoR is probably incredibly busy.Â  I'd wait a little longer before worrying about it, especially since it's LSD (chances of interception are low). :)

    I wouldn't worry yet, I have had delays with JOR in the past.
    <br/>
    And domestic LSD is one of the safest things to order.

    Hasn't come today either :/. JOR says we can contact them through the SR PM now if we put our tx # in the subject line. If not here by tomorrow Ill send a message asking them if they can possibly remember when it was sent out (Unlikely I know). A week UK domestic is too long. I'm hoping it wasn't marked as in transit when it was.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I expect the police knocking on my door if it has been seized?
