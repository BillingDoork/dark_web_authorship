    Well, I'm considering sending a firearm or two to the UK but I think the risk is crazy. If the tight asses in the UK Customs are as crazy as I think, I might forget about the idea entirely.
    <br/>
    Should I send in pieces and hide the pieces in less-than-scary objects?
    <br/>
    Do they really use XRays on everything or just things that they think are suspicious?
    <br/>
    I'm just worried that my buyer won't get their product and they'll be out a good chunk of cash.
    <br/>
    Professionals, help please.

    The problem with shipping guns is they are made of metal, and there are several structures in every gun that look basically the same, so an computerized x-ray machine can scan a lot of mail and pick out gun parts easily. I don't know how they x-ray mail, I would think they xray everything and have a computer pick out things that look like guns but maybe this is impractical, after all it is legal to ship guns if you are properly licensed so its not like every gun they find has to be illegal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would ship the gun in multiple shipments in pieces, this is a hassle and requires back and forth communication with the buyer, but its the safest way. Unlike shipping small quantities of drugs, if you get caught shipping a gun they will hunt you down. Ship one piece at a time and wait for the buyer to confirm that he/she got it before sending the next piece. You can probably disguise the barrel by shipping it with other metal rod like things, but keep the weight down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would do some more research on shipping guns, there are probably a lot of methods of doing so because I know guns are shipped illegally around the world all the time.

    Thanks, I was hoping to hear the X-Ray would be unconsistent, like whenever they see a suspicious package.
    <br/>
    I figure if I use a BS address as the return address and use an alibi, I could leave them on a wild goose chase. I live in a fairly big city, so if I used a courier from the other side of town, LE could be busting ass in that zip code and I wouldn't even know.
    <br/>
    I'll go through the Search bar but I doubt I'll find anything of major interest.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But for now... Bits and pieces seem to be the winner.

    you cant just send bits and pieces and expect it to arrive for sure, they look for parts as well and will confiscate them. unless you want to waste the money you need to do a good amount of more research
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you must ship the individual parts separately, which is still illegal, and actively disguise them as something else with other metal pieces somehow because some parts are still obvious - the entire gun is not worth anything if a single piece doesnt arrive. make sure the gun cant be traced to you either, or else you face severe consequences for exporting weapons... (see http://www.wtov9.com/news/news/federal-complaint-wheeling-man-shipped-illegal-wea/nP8My/) not exactly sure how it is done honestly, i just remember reading this same topic on the forum around a year ago. you might go to the armory sub-forum and inquire there if anyone can PM you a safer recommendation

    Thanks for the tip. I'll give the Armory Sub a shout and see what they say (IF they do).
