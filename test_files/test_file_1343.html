    So I've been waiting on an non-SR express package of nugget that should of been here today. Need to get tracking number from my buddy in the next few minutes/hours to check it out, but priority packages from this state (and from more rural, coastal locations) arrive reliably in the same time frame to my location. What is all of your guys' experience with late express packages, would you be worried as well? My house is completely clean, so I just hope it doesn't get awkward tomorrow. Any helpful input is appreciated.

    It's USPS.  Shit happens.  I've had express packages take two days even though they guaranteed overnight (and damn right I got my dollars back) when the previous two to the same address were both there overnight, on time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, if someone wants a signature or it isn't your usual postman or something smells fishy in general, better safe than sorry.

    too much paranoia on the forums... ::)

    You'll be fine. USPS is slow sometimes. I've had express packages from the same vendor take almost 24hours and sometimes 4-5 days.
