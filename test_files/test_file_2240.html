    Anyone had experience shipping to Thailand or receiving SR packages in Thailand?

    Going to try to give this post one more shot. I want to purchase a small amount of molly from UK/Germany/NL and have it shipped to my residence in Bangkok. Been here about 5 years and it's tough to find quality MDMA locally so buying via SR would be ideal, if possible. The thing that concerns me is shipping a package here. The Thai postal service is not sophisticated at all, but the penalties here could be severe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This would be my first purchase on SR.  So any notices of successful shipping to Bangkok or anywhere else in Thailand would be much appreciated. Thanks!

    Sounds pretty risky. Most places will just send you a customs letter... the thais will probably kick your door in a throw  you in jail for 10 years... specially if you're not a thai.

    I don't know but there's a roid vendor on here that ships from Thailand he might be a good person to msg maybe he might have something to say. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f868ad674e
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your a falang it's risky doing anything over there. I can't even go to Big C and buy beer without being questioned by the security guards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe get a local to receive it for you if there's somebody you can trust, a 500 baht bribe will get the police off their back.

    I can't wait to go back for the warm weather and eat some more Bar-B-Q Plaza!!!!

    Thanks for the lead! I will send a msg to him!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I thought about the option of having someone receive the package for me, too. The good thing about Thais is that they typically don't ask too many questions and mind their own business, as long as no one is snooping around too much. Just need to find an average joe who will let me send to him (for a fee!).

    I mean everything from random sports jerseys to coffee mugs, unless it was a simple letter i had to go to the post office to pick it up... and no not the local one, but the big one near the train station i cant remember the name of. when I ordered poker chips there i had to wait 8 hours on the first day, then 3 hours on the second to pick it uo

    I have had many packages sent to Thailand but never anything dodgy.  I have had books mailed, sports equipment even a poster map of the world in one of those document tubes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every package was opened and I think the main reason for this is to check if any import tax is owed.  In Thailand there is import tax on virtually everything, even free stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EG.  If someone sent you a demo of their band playing live, a cd or video, customs would determine a value for the cd, dvd or whatever and charge a tax rate based on their judged value.
    <br/>
    hey
    <br/>
    I started asking people I purchased books or tennis raquets off to put second hand or ex demonstration - and a much lower price.  On every occasion I did this they took my price as the price to work out tax from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Knowing Thailand they took whichever was higher - lol  Seriously anything that saves time on something they can't make $ out of will be followed.  And they can't make $ out of a tax payment involving two people they don't know, so they want this part of the day over with quickly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did notice that if I used regular mail then I had to go to post office to pick it up, but if a courier such as FED EX, UPS, DHL was used they would come to my door with the package and a reciept for tax payment.  I had to pay cash to the delivery guy for the tax and I would recieve the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm guessing that the courier pay the tax to get package released, then claim the tax from the recipient.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This could be an interesting angle to look at as if the package if found to contain narcotics would they still pay the tax, cos they are almost certanly going to lose it...................

    I resent being characterized as a steroid dealer!  I deal benzos and diet pills (clen and t3, and even phentermine, the good stuff!) too- and Kamagra and Apcalis!  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would do this.  Pay the vendor extra to buy something electronic.  A piece of computer equipment like a wireless router would be good.  Used is fine.  He can open it up and tape a little parcel of pills inside.  When you have to go pick it up at the post office, argue about the amount of duty they want you to pay.  Everyone does.  LOL.  But pay it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe a multitap usb hub is better.  You get the general idea though.  I do not recommend FedEx or UPS but DHL is very good.  IMHO, both FedEx and UPS really suck here.

    I find couriers here are very hit and miss, especially in the provinces as they use local agents which can be total crap or very good.  Unless you already know which ones are good or bad it can be risky as flax has pointed out.

    This. When people stereotype there is usually at least some facts behind it. The stereotype with Thailand is they are hard on drugs on the same level as the UAE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pay off a broke Thai and ship it to them would be my suggestion. Give them something nice, like 1000 Baht up front, and 10,000 when the package is delivered. Pricey, but probably worth it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Order large, and order infrequently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But this is only based off stereotypes. Thailand is a 2nd world country with very peaceful  and reflective people. They are also a close ally of the USA so I suspect they have similar equipment for incoming packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Thai could always fuck you over too so make sure to put care into the logistics of that.
