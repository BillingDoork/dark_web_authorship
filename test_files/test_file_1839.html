    Hello S.R. Friends I would very much appreciate if you would be able to assist me in a matter that I know little about. I am a new member and have only placed 3 orders. (2 of which are in question) The third order that I placed was for an inexpensive product which I finalized upon it going into "Transit". It arrived in a few days and the Vendor didn't even make me pay shipping even though I had forgot to select shipping method.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other two orders which I had placed before the 3rd order are the ones that are giving me problems. I placed the order roughly a week ago, and was not responded to by the vendor until a few days later. The msg that the vendor sent me was confusing as he/she does not have the best english. I have asked the vendor to confirm if indeed he was sending the orders. The orders are still (in transit) I have asked the vendor many many many times to respond to me, and give me a simple "yes" or "no" answer as to whether these orders have actually been shipped or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have checked the vendors profile and he has been online quite frequently, so that is not that issue.  These are expensive orders so I am rather anxious, and would not like to lose my money..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My questions are: if the vendor was unable to ship the items, would he/she have cancelled the order right away? Will I be able to get my money back if the Vendor did not ship the items at all?  Will Silk Road support me in a resolution as I have clearly tried to contact the vendor and he//she is choosing not to contact me back?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do not want to mention any vendors name because i want to believe the best in someone. Also because this vendor has made, many, many successful trasactions in the past with only a few bad reviews. However maybe he/she just waits for the expensive orders to try and scam users?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since I have only made the previous order that went through and came to my door in a few days I would love some feedback as to what everyone thinks may have happened keeping in mind that this vendor has a very very good track record. i am really worried and would love and appreciate if users can give me past experiences, and some advice to what to do

    First and most importantly, if you STAY IN ESCROW, you will eventually be able to get your btc back.  You will eventually enter resolution and make your claim. If the product does not arrive and the vendor does not have proof of it being sent/delivered you will be good to go.  It may take time to get to that point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A lot of things can happen on the vendor side to cause him to not get right back to you, but if it has been a week that is odd.  Have other buyrs left very recent feedback on his page? Are they good?  Any updates on his page?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sure others can also offer advice, but do not finalize.  That is your only protection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, if you are bran new, why go jumping into a large buy?  This is one of the biggest problems for new folks.  Get to know a vendor with small buys and communication.  Being eager will get you scammed.

    Well I have stayed within escrow. It wasn't that it was an extremely large order, just a rather expensive product so even a small amount is expensive. I do not know what to do. I have proof that the user has made no attempt to contact me or respond to me. what happens next if the vendor continues to ignore me. I'm just so frustrated about this.
