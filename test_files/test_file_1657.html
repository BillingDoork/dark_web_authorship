    I still receive a previous occupant's mail sometimes. Mostly junk mail: advertisements, special offers, etc. If the previous occupant had had their mail forwarded to a new address, would I still receive these things? Does junk mail just slip through somehow? Granted, there's no reason to think this person would have their real mail -- bills and whatnot -- still sent to my address. They would have notified whatever business of their change of address, whereas special offers they don't care about, well, that's obvious. Still curious though.

    Thanks.

    The best way to figure out if a package will get through or not under a name is to send one yourself. Just spend the 5 or 6 bucks and send a empty USPS priority box to yourself under the old persons name. Just use a random return address is all, be silly to send a package from location A to location A =P

    Yes if the previous occupant forwarded their mail you would still get their junk mail..
    <br/>
    Usually it is the stuff that says Jake Smith or current resident. Magazines they forward for a shorter period of time, I forget what it is. Then first class like bills mail is a year of forwarding, packages too.

    I'm contemplating doing it to my address too. Been nervous to lose a package because of it. I would DEF try something legit, or even a few legit things. Even if it's not the former tenant, you could def try a diff name too. I still feel like if you have been getting packages for awhile and all of a sudden they come in someone elses name, it might draw red flags? idkkkkkkkk

    USE a mail private forwarding service. Particularly anonymous ones are good
