    I'm just going to mention the way I've seen it done from normal commercial operations. Usually that is the small glass bottle itself, placed inside a small zip lock style bag, then that wrapped with a combination of like perforated cardboard and tissue paper, then that inside another larger zip lock bag, then that in the shipping box.

    Order some bottles from a professional glass vial supplier (discountvials.com is good) and see what their packaging is like. I'd go ziplock/vacuum seal, then styrofoam or some padding around that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck!

    We already ordered some.
    <br/>
    But since it's legal here it just comes in a box with some paper/foam to protect the bottles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We were wondering what is required to ship a bottle, which is pretty apparent when in a padded envelope.
    <br/>
    Probably taking the liquid out of the bottle, but this liquid kind of hates plastic...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And its really flamable.
    <br/>
    We would ship it unopened, but dont want to cause trouble/get intercepted.
    <br/>
    I mean, if they see a bottle they will check what is inside right? Could be ghb, very illegal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And why a vacuum seal/ziplock if the bottle is unopened?
