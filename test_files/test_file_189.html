    Scenario - I will be making a purchase soon on SR but i cannot have it sent to my house so i will be sending it to a friends house (with them knowing of course)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question - If something were to happen that involved the package being discovered and the LE coming into play would my friend be able to pretend like he did not know the package was intended for him? basically ruling him out of any wrong doing? keep in mind that the purchase will be done on my end, on my computer, in my home, with no evidence of any sort that would lead LE to pin the contents of the package to my friend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as soon as he receives the package he will be writing "return to sender" on it for the first few days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PLEASE answer back ASAP as i would like to know how to approach this.  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS- I posted this in a previous thread but made my own thread to get some more eyes on it.

    Cops rarely bust buyers. Especially if it's only pot.
    <br/>
    But for now let's assume they are doing a CD:
    <br/>
    1. Make sure that there is nothing incriminating in the house that you are ordering to.
    <br/>
    2. If they suspect it was ordered online they will confiscate your hard drives, CDs, computers. Don't have anything incriminating on you hard drives either. Not even pirated movies or songs. Who knows? Maybe if they can't get you with drugs they will bill you 250K for every movie you have on your hard drive (Remember? FBI WARNING! :o)
    <br/>
    3. Do not say ANYTHING without a lawyer. This cannot be stressed enough.
    <br/>
    Choose your vendors wisely and there shouldn't be any problems.

    Package of drugs can be sent by anyone.  All it would do is give them probable cause to search his house so as long as he's clear on everything else they can't make anything stick.

    Just talking about this on another thread. I can only tell you United States laws, and we have "Plausible Deniability" - Means exactly what it says.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's completely plausible that you have no idea what was coming in the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They would have to have a search warrant. If not, then even if they find a pound of heroin, they violated your rights, if there was no warrant signed by a judge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would advise against "Return To Sender" - That sounds like the WORST idea! - Now they try to return it. Find the return address is fictitious. Then have probable cause for the postmaster to open it, because it will end up in the "dead letter" bin. It will be under scrutiny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They will put two and two together, and your friend will probably be under surveillance for a while
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Really, just don't do that. I'm not sure how you thought that would work, maybe I'm missing something, but it sounds like a terrible idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just accept the letter/parcel .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shit I've signed for packages standing right in front of my house. There was heroin or coke inside. Good packaging.. Been buying since April. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Good luck
