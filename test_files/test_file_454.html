    Hey whats up dudes
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The dilemma I have here is with a DCN I believe
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I type the DCN on the USPS site it gives me this error:
    <br/>
    Delivery status information is not available for your item via this web site. A return receipt after mailing may be available through your local Post Office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The item was supposedly shipped Tuesday morning so if anything it should be delivered here tomorrow at the latest. Even USPS said it or if it doesn't arrive tomorrow to have me file a complaint.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well the thing is I've ordered from this vendor twice before and it went very smoothly, there was tracking at every post office when it arrived and departure. USPS kept trying to tell me the package may have not been sent out and that I could have been just given a false DCN but I don't believe this since this vendor has been good to me in the past two transaction, which were both recents also.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now the main question is
    <br/>
    - Have any of you used this DCN and it came up with the messages above and your package still end up arriving on time? (usually 2-3 days after package was mailed)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks please let me know as this would take a HUGE weight off my shoulder, I just want my stuff before the holidays and i'm worried. :(

    That message is the one you get when there's no record in their system of it.  Try any combination at all, even if it isn't a valid DCN length -- it'll say the same thing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make sure it's the right DCN.  If he verifies it, it's probably just not in the system yet.  It's a Delivery Confirmation #, not a tracking number.  It's much less detailed and reliable.

    So do you think it's possible I will still receive my product tomorrow even without the site ever updating?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes its the right DCN, he even told me he doubled checked it. It was supposedly mailed out tuesday he said and it's thursday now, still nothing.  I ordered from him the past two times, last week and two weeks ago, when I used the DCN it actually tracked it throughout with no issues and arrived on the third day after mailing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just found this so damn strange, either USPS is not doing any scanning or my vendor is lying and just gave me a false dcn but idk I cant accuse him because he has been good the past two shipments, I am just frustrated, figures it happens on my biggest purchase also.

    No doubt it happens on your biggest order - that's how they do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DCNs can be weird sometimes. USPS is also a bit overwhelmed this time of year. There is nothing you can do but just wait it out and see.

    Either wouldn't surprise me, honestly (scammed or DCN not being scanned yet).  Basically their part is to scan it ON DELIVERY.  Hence the Deliv. Conf. name.  If they do that, they didn't fuck up.  The rest is basically a courtesy they do out of being awesome postal workers.

    I don't think he would scam me because the money is in the escrow system, so there's really nothing to gain for the vendor except I have no idea, maybe USPS is really overloaded and told all workers not to scan this week and just sort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just want some peace of mind before tomorrow comes, because we all know if I don't see it in the mail tomorrow, something is up.

    Nothing is necessarily 'up' if it doesn't show up tomorrow. Packages sometimes take longer then 3 days even when it isn't the week before xmas.

    DCN's are not tracking numbers.
    <br/>
    They can have as little as 1 scan ... a delivery scan.
    <br/>
    During the holidays, they are swamped and each piece is likely not getting scanned if it is just DCN

    You said he shipped Tuesday?
    <br/>
    Nothing is being delivered in 2 days right now...(or at least nothing that I have ordered)
    <br/>
    My most recent Priority deliveries took 4 days and 5 days.
    <br/>
    I would def not rely on the DCN for tracking.

    Yes, I would expect the package tomorrow if it was INDEED shipped on Tuesday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I order from him last week and it was shipped on Wednesday, which I received on a Saturday (3 Days)
    <br/>
    two weeks ago I ordered on a Friday and received on a Monday (3 Days)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So it SHOULD be here tomorrow except the fact that the DCN is not updating unlike the previous two purchases, which updated at every post office arrival and departure.
