    Hi all
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this has probably been discussed 100's of times already, but having looked at the local market and unable to find what I am after, I am thinking of purchasing from the Netherlands. I guess my main concern is the labeling of this European country as one associated with recreational use and the importing of product into the UK. Concerned is putting it lightly. I have little fear in domestic supply but the added involvement of borders has me a little on edge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Probably have all the answers, but do any of you do this often and any tips.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's all about quality not quantity and a few discrete purchases not a long term thing

    If you need the product to be shipped to your home address and want to be reasonable safe, you have to keep your house clean of any illegal substances or equipment used to consume those substances. You could just keep it at a friends home. Then make sure that your vendor sends the package without the requirement of signing it. So you will just find it in your mail box and bring it inside. DONT open it yet, but cross out your address and write "return to sender" in red. Leave it like that for a couple of days.
    <br/>
    After a few days I would feel safe enough to open it. Remember that should the police ask questions never tell them that you bought anything!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This may sound a bit scary but are just some precautions for the worst case. Normally when the customs would find a small delivery of illegal substances you would just receive a small notice and that is all. But then your address is flagged and you should not use it anymore to buy drugs.

    Domestic is risky enough.

    Overseas is too risky IMHO.

    If you had actually seen some of the NL's packaging for small amounts of powders you wouldn't even be asking this question, some are ingenious

    Domestic or Overseas doesn't matter but the reputation of the vendor you are ordering from does.  I think it also depends on what country you are in too because the more mail that has to be delivered it's more likely to get though.  As for ordering from NL be expected to wait longer for the product.  I would bet they check a higher percentage of NL(or other drug producing countries) packages then the rest.  That doesn't mean it won't make it just that it takes longer to get there.

    I'm 2 for 2 with Cloudsurfer. 1g and 5g both perfect stealth. Believe these guys when they say the packaging that is used is super stealth. Customs could open the package and have absolutely no idea what's in it. Have an order in transit from Pfand so we'll see how his shipping is. Takes roughly 2 weeks from NL.
