    As title states, im going to have a small rant now because with so many orders coming in and being delivered, about 1/15 so far have been labeled with username.. when all you order is weed/hash/lsd its pretty fucking easy to get confused as to which order to finalize because the person who sent the package didnt identify themselves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FUCKING IDENTIFY YOURSELF - PLEASE! It will help the buyer finalize your order and get you your BTC quicker, and thats what you want right?!?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think this should be pinned to top of this Category because i have spoken to SEVERAL users who have the same problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ex: 25 orders IN TRANSIT, all weed and hash varieties.  On a Friday you recieve lets say 3 packages. You open em up, and 9/10 will have a weight writing on it, but nothing to do with WHO sent it to you.  Leave a mark, leave a keyphrase, leave your username, or even a vendor should msg the buyer with a ID number that will be written on the bag of weed so they know who to finalize.  Today i got 4 packages, finalised one of the wrong ones because ended up having to do background country checks and price/transaction comparisons just to figure out whos it is!  Also for example, one of the ones i got today was hash. a gram sample from ?????????? just says 015 on the vacuseal.  The shipping labels say it came from Spain so i finalized an order i have outstanding with (what i thought was) the only Spanish order i have currently, WRONG, that spanish order i finalized was for 2g weed....... and with Custom orders you cant ssee description after its been processed, so, *deep breath*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    VENDORS:  IDENTIFY YOURSELF DISCREETLY IN YOUR PACKAGING AND NOTIFY YOUR BUYER WHAT TO LOOK FOR. OTHERWISE YOUR GOING TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF SCAMMERS, BEFUDDLED NEWBS NOT FINALIZING ON TIME, AND JUST GENERALLY NOT GETTIN YOUR FUCKING MONEY RIGHT. SORT IT OUT PLEASE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *rant over*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    haha :) :) +1 for anyone who agrees.  Lets discuss?

    I have not used identifying marks on my packages so if they are intercepted, it can't be linked to SR.  But you gave a great idea of using a code that is sent to the buyer.  I will start to do that on packages I send out.
    <br/>
    Thanks for the information

    I will never ever do this and even specifically state it in my T+C. Customers can easily ID my packages by asking me when they get them, they don't need hallmarking.

    Simple fix, Message vendor and say "Hay, I got 3 packages today and I think one of them is from you but I can not tell. Can you drop me the DCN or a way that I can tell which is from you?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor reply's and you finalize or vendor does not reply and has to wait for finalization.  ::)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Simple. ;)

    plus you didnt send it to the same place i hope

    <br/>
    little question
    <br/>
    would it be reliable to have a sticker on the backof envelope saying *if not delivered or recived return to pobox blabla* so i can control shipments and know if some deapshit who ordered didnt recive his order it would come back to me at some point unless its compamised or simply lolst?
