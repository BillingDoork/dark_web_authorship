    What are your thoughts on having your order delivered with a tracked option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I see it:
    <br/>
    PROS
    <br/>
    Less chance of either party getting scammed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CONS
    <br/>
    Checking tracked packages on tor - red flag
    <br/>
    Unwanted scrutiny during transit
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So is that it? Or are there other reasons why people want or don't want tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is tracking essentially a trade-off between "scam-risk" and "seizure-risk"?

    The pros outweigh the cons. All you have to do is alert the buyer the dangers of checking tracking via tor, as it is mutually beneficial not to do so, so you can cross that point off your list. It is a bit of a tradeoff between scam-risk and seizure-risk, but for domestic it is usually never problematic.

    Tracking is great and I see no cons whatsoever with tracking.

    I honestly expected most people to be quite strongly opposed to tracking...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I guess if the packaging is good, there is no real increase in the risk of seizure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seems like its down to buyer/vendor trust. If they have traded successfully before then there's not much reason to use track and trace?

    Well I don't think the buyer should get the tracking number at all until resolution.
    <br/>
    You say for domestic it's not problematic, but do you feel it's an unnecessary risk for international orders?
