    Hello, I've lurked the forums a bit, but I've decided that it's time to make an account to ask some questions and potentially start participating in commerce.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to order multiple drugs, and, ideally, be able to hold on to them for a little while. I don't plan on purchasing large amounts, and I don't plan to keep them very long. I thought it would be best to order the drugs a little while in advance before actually using them, but in the event that a shipment is pulled I'm concerned that would raise suspicion on other shipments. I don't plan on ordering from the same people either. How long should I wait between each order? Should I wait to receive the first before ordering the second and each consecutive order?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've read a lot of conflicting information regarding how I should order as well. I've read that a PGP key should be used when sending the shipping information to the seller (I don't know how to do this, but I can research it when the time comes). I've also read people saying to ship it directly to my address while others say to set up a fake PO. I think the later would prove worse overall if caught, because you could no longer claim plausible deny-ability. I think I also need to look up how to anonymously convert my currency to BTC.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help on these matters would be greatly appreciated, my gratitude in advance.

    Bump. If no one wants to answer the other questions, at least let me know of a time frame between shipments please.

    If your planning on purchasing different products from different vendors I personally wouldn't worry to much about the time frame in which you order them. I've heard of people making large purchases from international vendors where one of the packages were intercepted but the others slipped through ok (when you make a large purchase a lot of time vendors will send the product in multiples of smaller packages, in part, for the very reason you are concerned).  So I wouldn't worry to much about that, not to say you shouldn't be careful and always look inside yourself and make an informed decision.
    <br/>
    Don't get the product sent with a fake name or "preferred customer" or any of the others, this can be bad news.
    <br/>
    Use a name that is associated with the address you are sending.
    <br/>
    Do you need help setting up your pgp? I might have a few links handy and also there is some useful information on this topic in this  forum that can give you peace of mind and keep you secure, remember you can never learn to much when it comes to security.
    <br/>
    When you receive your package(s) shred the envelope (I burn them) you don't want these in your house the vendors are trusting you as much as you are trusting them.

    It's entirely up to you how you flip the coin, but consider the factors:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Domestic shipments are a lot less risky, they're common, and they don't stand out. Mixing up vendors
    <br/>
    (so hopefully senders location too) can be a plus too. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, unless your confident of their work.
    <br/>
    International shipments will be more risk on average, so limit those as much as possible.

    When it comes to security, this needs to be clear and simple. PGP. PGP. PGP. There are no substitutions. Everytime you need to communicate sensitive information (such as addresses, orders, personal information, etc.) PGP is your lifeline between jailtime and deniability. No logs, and no connection to what you do. This means:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tails LiveCD/Liberte LiveCD. Boot up your computer on LiveCD'/USBs and all of your work is never saved on any kind of harddrive. There are no logs to be found to hold against you in court, if shit hits the fan. Everytime your ram is wiped, CD/USB ejected, it's game over. Get another SD card/USB drive and Truecrypt it. Make a hidden partition, encrypt it at max strength with a strong password, and leave public paritition light encrypt with easy pass. Give it away if your door is kicked down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You're trying to blend in, not raise eyebrows. Your mailman runs his route nearly everyday of his life. Real names, real addresses. Anybody can send you anything, and if they have nothing tying you to ordering or accepting responsibility for the package you will win. P.O. Box? I don't think anybody has plausible deniability if this is the case because a P.O. Box number is not public information, nor is it smooth to have it suddenly opened, and then questionable packages get sent to it. I'd fear a sting on the person going to pick it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the BTC, whatever route you end up going just make sure it does not store information directly linking to you. Bank Transfers, Wire Transfers, I predict local bought MoneyPaks might be dangerous if a rogue currency exchanger is setup or it's given to LE. Cash in the mail is always good, or maybe the new CVS/7-11 way people are talking about, just make sure you drive out of town to do it.

    I still have two concerns based on your post k1, the main reason I'm concerned about multiple orders is because I wouldn't have time to use all of the drugs in the time between each shipment. They would all be in personal use amounts, but in the event of one interception I don't want to be caught with multiple drugs (or any for that matter). What should I do about this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assuming that everything makes it here fine then by the time I get the last order I should be safe to keep them in my house right? I could protect them via storage methods, put them in something, and hide that somewhere else until I get the last shipment. Is this a good idea?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now about tails, I'm fine with using tails to start the money conversion to BTC, and then actually order it when using tails, but I've already been using tor to research this on my main hdds. I didn't think this was that big of a mistake, but should I be concerned about that? I have some SR and black market reloaded links bookmarked in tor. What do you recommend doing at this point? I'm not in any large hurry to get them, so I plan on making sure I have as much knowledge about the situation as possible prior to making any action.

    International parcels are a lot more common than some would have you believe.  It's a global world.  When I get a large order I will divide it to keep each envelope nice and small and thin.  In this case I put 4-5 days between them.  This is fine for most application.  Do you live in a small town with a single post office serving 1,000 people?  Maybe more time is better.  Live in Los Angeles or Toronto?  Probably no number of international parcels will get you flagged or make anyone suspicious.
