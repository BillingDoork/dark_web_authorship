    When the mailman delivers a package that needs a signiture (lets say from canada), will that always be done by the guy dropping off the regular mail ? E.G. If I got my normal mail is there another mail man/woman that may come around later with the package needed for signing ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wondering if anyone has experiences with that happening or if it is pretty atypical.

    Gotta get one of these and compile some data: http://www.amazon.com/Mail-Chime-Wireless-Alert-System/dp/B00103FDDU/ref=pd_sim_sbs_k_1/178-3512650-7766053

    Will also be useful for reducing neighbor's suspicions by not checking the mail every hour.

    Express mail has a special delivery truck, but it can go on the regular mail truck too, it just depends which method will get it there the fastest.

    It all depends on how quickly your local sorting facility got it and if the package made it to your normal delivery driver in time to go out with the regular mail. I have seen it come many times both ways. Some instances it would come on the regular truck and others a person in a regular (unmarked as far as USPS insignia's) vehicle. The USPS will send it whichever way will get it there by the promised time.

    Good luck and I must agree with the above poster. Don't go out and check the mail too often. If something goes wrong and your neighbors see you checking the mail every quarter hour it could be used against you...

    I always get mine delivered by a special truck and it gets here around 10 or 11am every time...my normal mail man doesn't deliver the mail until around 3 or 4pm. I freaking love USPS express, I always get my packages the very next day but I guess it's because I live only 30 minutes away from a large sorting center/large airport.

    Thanks for the replies !  Was a seperate mail person for swim's latest package.  Which ever is fastest definitely makes sense.
