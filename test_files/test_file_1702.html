    Flat as possible. Means you have to vacuum seal.

    If you don't use a heat sealed MBB, your risk percentage sky rockets greatly.

    Weed is if not the most or one of the most trickiest to stealth ship. Vacum sealed is a must and triple vacum sealed even better. Personally I would never attempt but a lot of vendors do it with success. Idk all the busts I've read or heard about have always involved weed just because if the packaging is not 110% foolproof then it could end bad. I wouldn't even think about shipping it internationally either if you're asking this question :P

    Vacuum seal one time to make the package smaller and elimiante space. No one who knows about shipping drugs vacuum seals for smell. Your going to put someone in prison giving out shitty advice like this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't have a vacuum sealer, make sure MOST IMPORTANT, that the weed is heat sealed in a mylar bag. Moisture barrier mylar bag. Many hydroponic  stores sell the bags.

    <br/>
    You need no special tools to seal it, use your girlfriends hair straighter.

    Yes cause clearly some anonymous internet dude has the power to send someone to jail. Have you ordered shit off SR before?? Have you seen the shit way vendors pack their product? Do you really think me telling him to vacum seal it or triple vacum seal it is worse than the idea of throwing the weed in a bubble enevelope? People are free to do what they want. I'm not getting anyone thrown in jail as you keep saying. It's advice. Obvioulsy by the question of the OP it is an overall bad idea for him to do it, if has to ask how. So in reality you should be directing your stupid remarks to OP instead of me cause as well I even stated in my post that I have never shipped weed nor ever will.

    Sweet, glad you have a life. It's vendors like me, that make sure the police don't come knocking on your door because scruff mcgruff the crime dog picked up on your package, so you can continue to have that life. Since I'm such a "loser" for knowing this "crap."

    First of all I'm not a vendor. Second of all if I was I wouldn't be selling weed. Thirdly if I was vendor and I shipped out something it wouldn't be traceable back to me as ummmm like I wouldn't put my real address as a return address? Is that something you do? lol

    By offering bad advice, you certainly aren't helping OP stay out of jail, now are you? This isn't about methods that aren't as bad as other methods. This is about THE BEST methods. Simply advising OP to vacuum seal it an extra time doesn't make it a good method. You are right in saying it's not a great idea to begin with though. But again, as you said, people are free to do what they want (more or less).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You admit that you've never shipped and never will ship contraband. Hallucinating horse, on the other hand, is an internet drug dealer with almost 100 deals so far. Maybe he's somebody who has some credibility in this department considering he's still selling. This is great information from a good source which I'm guessing OP wanted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not one to hide behind a computer screen and talk shit but your last two sentences seriously made me laugh. So you have such a busy life yet you have 151 posts on these forums (averaging over 5 a day) and have continued to post in this particular thread... Furthermore, if you are so busy, why would you take it upon yourself to misinform the OP? You were not forced to TRY to help this person out. Now hallucinating horse is trolling? What the fuck is your definition of trolling? Helping people? Going out of one's way for strangers? Using valuable and relevant personal experience to answer somebody's question? Patiently sharing accepted knowledge with somebody who could have found it themselves if they looked?

I'm not getting anyone thrown in jail as you keep saying. It's advice. Obvioulsy by the question of the OP it is an overall bad idea for him to do it, if has to ask how. So in reality you should be directing your stupid remarks to OP instead of me cause as well I even stated in my post that I have never shipped weed nor ever will.

      Ya I didn't see the previous post on the board about vacum seal. Again I'm very sorry about that but some of us have lives and can't sit on SR boards all day trolling people.

     By offering bad advice, you certainly aren't helping OP stay out of jail, now are you? This isn't about methods that aren't as bad as other methods. This is about THE BEST methods. Simply advising OP to vacuum seal it an extra time doesn't make it a good method. You are right in saying it's not a great idea to begin with though. But again, as you said, people are free to do what they want (more or less).

     You admit that you've never shipped and never will ship contraband. Hallucinating horse, on the other hand, is an internet drug dealer with almost 100 deals so far. Maybe he's somebody who has some credibility in this department considering he's still selling. This is great information from a good source which I'm guessing OP wanted.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'm not one to hide behind a computer screen and talk shit but your last two sentences seriously made me laugh. So you have such a busy life yet you have 151 posts on these forums (averaging over 5 a day) and have continued to post in this particular thread... Furthermore, if you are so busy, why would you take it upon yourself to misinform the OP? You were not forced to TRY to help this person out. Now hallucinating horse is trolling? What the fuck is your definition of trolling? Helping people? Going out of one's way for strangers? Using valuable and relevant personal experience to answer somebody's question? Patiently sharing accepted knowledge with somebody who could have found it themselves if they looked?

    Wrong, I said that I have never shipped or will ship weed. Trolling can mean a lot of things..google it. So by your definition there is only one correct way to ship weed? Interesting. Hallucinatinghorse assumes a lot of things. One is that I've never ordered from a top vendor. I've ordered from vendors that even if the package was intercepted the product would most likely would not be found. As well I have ordered from vendors that think 'stealth' means wrapping the product in paper and stuffing it into a bubble mailer. Do you really think 5 posts a day is a lot? lol... again this is turned into a big e-peen contest that I'm honestly not that interested in as I could care less. Thanks for the negative karma btw :)

     Sweet, glad you have a life. It's vendors like me, that make sure the police don't come knocking on your door because scruff mcgruff the crime dog picked up on your package, so you can continue to have that life. Since I'm such a "loser" for knowing this "crap."

    In my opinion, most of the time proper exterior shipping methods like proper postage, return addresses/individual name or business being legitimate and not standing out, and the correct choice of mailers without excessive taping, uneven weight distribution, small as possible, flat as possible (if envelope), no stuff rattling around, etc. will get you through no problem. Domestic anyway. The person doing the drop if it isn't in a blue box, must be on the level as well and not get nervous, or profiled somehow. The inside of the pack should at least have several layers of whatever (I prefer a box inside another box, for bigger things) or another envelope if that is the mailer type being used. Many opaque layers...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously odor containing sealing materials are a given amongst that. But if you really want to be "stealth," then hide the impeccably multiple layered sealed item inside a legit product and/or box with the rest of the parcel (return label, packaging, etc.) supporting the facade of some retail item that could be sent by any number of legit online retailers or an ebay/amazon type situation.
