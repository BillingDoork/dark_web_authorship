    I am worried, I had a pack from a TRUSTED AND OFTEN USED VENDOR! It was very decent size. Like i said from overseas Eu to US. Now, we have worked out on that end. My concern is wtf to expect? I have a clean house and computer so no question, but i have heard of people waiting 34 days? I mean, no tracking and no love letter! I know it was sent! I just need some vets to noobs advice who had similar situations! I mean IS IT 100% FUCKED? Should i expect a knock? I mean i know no one can tell me future but some similar experiences help! and for your time i always give positive karma!
    <br/>
    I just want to hear from my brothers and sisters who have had something like this happen. Also, is there like 30days that they have to send love letter&gt; or is that bullshit?   Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!!!!!! I thank you for your time
    <br/>
    thanks in advance
    <br/>
    my fellow SR users we have to stick together and knowledge is power so please help share it that is how we help each other thanks again!

    I already have reship in route to a new addy, but my main concern is with the size of the order, Should i expect a knock&gt; I mean i didnt get a letter?
    <br/>
    Has anyone had this happen, I have read people get in 30+days i mean i guess i have written it off, The vendor reshiped but my main concern is what is going to happen in experience? I mean even tho almost 200 tabs, would that be a letter? i doubt it but i never got one! I just wondering what to expect!!!
    <br/>
    please anyone and i appreciate and will give a +1 karma for sharing your experience or similar situation
    <br/>
    please let meknow
    <br/>
    thanks in advance

    thanks for the honesty turningjap +1 to you and others who give good feedback for your time and honesty,
    <br/>
    I read some reviews where people ordering from Ah waited 32 and even 39 days! I think he ships from germany. Which is very close to where mine was headed from. I just want to know if there is any hope for 1?
    <br/>
    And for 2. We are talking about a big f;en order! i mean i have worked out that with vendor but still. I mean I got no love letter and i am thinking much to large for that? I have never gotten one so i do not know! It sucks I mean what should i expect a knock.. I mean i got clean house and computer ect. but I dont know what the fuck to think. No tracking and i know it was sent! I only deal with one vendor and he had proof he sent as always. So that is not a question. The question is what the fuck can i expect now?????
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you i am sure you can see why i am worried, It would be nice to hear from people who did wait 30+days or have received a love letter. Just some advice on what to think!
    <br/>
    thanks and karma for any of my SR fam who can help:)
