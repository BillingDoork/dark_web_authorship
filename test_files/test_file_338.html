    Hey fine folks,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just got this from a non-SR customer. He doesn't have a reason to lie to me so I think it must be true. FYI in case the info changes your best practices.
    <br/>

    " I talked to my cousin who use to work for the postal service and is in the MJ game. he told me one way inspector checked on suspicious packages. he said they would use a needle the width of a sewing needel but much longer in length. and when they felt a package was suspicious they would poke through the box and if the needle smelled like drugs etc, then they would call the dog. i know you double box it but i still think a needle would go through it. one thing my friend recommended is to use those plastic box like kids use to store there arts and crafts in or a thick plastic box people pack there lunch in. that way the needle cant go
    <br/>
    through it."

    Well, if they did this before they obtained a warrant, wouldn't that be an unlawful search? I'm pretty sure probing someone's mail with a needle to determine the contents would qualify as "searching". Besides, I don't think that method would be very effective, anyhow. Not unless they got lucky and penetrated the package in just the right spot.

    Customs does not need a warrant so they could do it. Regular usps mail is supposed to have a warrant first so if it was found out they did the needle trick the evidence would be tossed and the person who did it would be in trouble. But first you have to prove they did it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've heard about this being done with large shipments. They used a large needle like a knitting needle but sharper and it would pull out a tiny bit of what it went into. All that is legit at the border.

    It's this kind of information that leads me to believe that there are many, many border control agents that don't want to see people getting arrested over mailed contraband. From my own experience, and certainly that of others, there is little possibility that customs agents are performing this kind of check diligently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It reminds me of one time that me and a car full of friends were pulled over by the police. They searched the car, and it's occupants. One of the occupants had a set of electronic scales, stashed within their bag in the car. None of us were in possession of illegal narcotics (although the individual in question was intending to buy drugs later on that day, hence the scales). Both myself and the owner of the scales observed a police officer clearly happening upon them, but then carefully and nonchalantly placing them back in the rucksack. Now, the police officer might have been incompetent, or just badly trained, but when I consider the neighborhood we were in at the time, I find that hard to believe. Neither me or any of my friends could understand it though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We were all let go without incident, and later on, someone older with a bit more experience in dealing with law enforcement officers offered a credible explanation. The police officer either wanted to go home, because it was the end of their shift, or, they didn't even agree with what they were doing, and didn't want to see us punished for something that isn't morally wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Law enforcement officers, whether police or border agents, are human too. Some more so than others, admittedly, but they don't want to see people harmed unnecessarily any more than you or I do.

    Agreed. If you're hoping to get turned loose by the cops based on "moral" reasons, get ready for a surprise. You're just another notch in their belt. They would LOVE to bust you doing anything, regardless of the seriousness.

    This information is 100% true. A family member of my friends is a shrink that has been doing ride alongs with officers lately to observe their conduct towards different races. On several occasions the officer was called into the post office to over see that exact style of search be performed.

       Law enforcement officers, whether police or border agents, are human too. Some more so than others, admittedly, but they don't want to see people harmed unnecessarily any more than you or I do.

      this is bs.  postal inspectors wouldn't be working there if they had moral problems with it.

     Agreed. If you're hoping to get turned loose by the cops based on "moral" reasons, get ready for a surprise. You're just another notch in their belt. They would LOVE to bust you doing anything, regardless of the seriousness.

    I dont know man. I had one lucky encounter. I was hot boxin my new car and had a half o in the cup holder and a cop came and boxed me in. He came and knocked on my window and the smoke flew out the window hitting him in the face, then he looked directly at my weed and i shit you not just said "This park closed two hours ago, you need to leave." Then just fucking left. I had an angel looking out for me. Scared the shit out of me, but i learned from my mistake and dont smoke in my car out in the public anymore.

    I think the post about cops being human is right on point.  Many people don't have a moral problem with marijuana.  The fact it's not accepted by society is one of the main reasons why people have to act shady when they are using or buying it.

    Drunk driving is the killer.  I'm not here to talk about one evil vs another but it seems like most of the time people don't care weed as much as long as you aren't being disrespectful about it.

    Indeed. I'm not saying that everyone in the police is like this, everyone's experience of the typical police officer is of a bullying ego-maniac. The job attracts that personality type, purely because they recognize the opportunity for licensed domineering. This doesn't stop good people from being motivated to sign up either, although I think we're all aware that they're a minority compared to the bullying types.
