    I've been here for over a year I've gotten anywhere from small letters to large packages sent to this address (keep in mind all were from overseas to US). I ordered ket from 2 vendors in july and both still havent shown one was shipped 28 days ago from Canada and the other 20 days since being shipped from the UK (both &gt;5g so will be letters have received from these vendors before). What should I do? better question what should I think? Are they lost? is the address I'm using flagged? Unfortunately I'm in between flats and moved back in with my parents for the month and the mail room at my old apt complex is going to forward any mail to what ever address is on my license which is all fine and dandy for august but when i move out in september I don't want those things showing up at my rents house.

    If the orders were shipped by slow/standard mail, you're still within a reasonable delivery window.  Surface packages and sometimes lettermail can take ove ra month from the UK.  28 days from Canada is long, but not unheard of.  I would give the Canadian package 1 more week before you start to worry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Might also be that mail forwarding fucked up.  That's sadly only too common.

    In all cases, during a deliver you should keep the delivery address clean.

    Two no shows and I personally would not order to that address again.

    Only time will tell.

    If I am understanding the sequence of events here, I am betting that the change of address is what's messing things up. I agree with postrex: There are far too many errors that occur with that system, and many items are simply "lost." To be safe, I would definitely have future deliveries arrive elsewhere. Best to assume that address is ruined -- even if your packages were "lost" due to the change of address. Eventually, I would assume that *someone* opened them and has access to the delivery address.... Sorry man. That's a real bummer.

    I can honestly say that i ordered a Soccer jersey on ebay from a seller in the UK and it took ~30 days.  I remember receiving that package and the dates and time stamps indicated that it made it to customs in about 7-10 days. then took about 20 to clear customs and arrive at my house in the US.  I would say you are within acceptable range for the UK package.  I'm not really sure about Canada, never had anything shipped from Canada before....
