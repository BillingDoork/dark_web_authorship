    My first 5 orders came in like 3 business days, then I did my first overseas order from a reputable vendor (I'm in US) it was dispatched 3-15 and still hasn't arrived.
    <br/>
    First time I had to had to hit the resolve button for time extension.      I have like 7 orders (all small) in transit and shouldv'e atleast received a few of them by now.  What could be the reason? Easter? Or?
    <br/>
    During this time I ordered and received 2 orders from local vendors I've used before.?.?  I did get scammed by that 'luceydrop' acid vendor (only time I ever FE'd)!
    <br/>
    Anyone know what's up with this?

    Lol perhaps ordering 7 orders at once wasnt the best idea, maybe one got picked up on the way through, now the rest of the 6 have been picked up also..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    International ordes always take longer, you cant compare them to your '3 days' first 5 orders...
