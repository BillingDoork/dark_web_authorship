    Hello everyone, first post here.Â  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know there are many posts concerning shipping to Israel, but my question is a bit different (I read all threads about this topic).
    <br/>
    Well, a week ago (last Monday), I have ordered a product to Israel, shipped from the Netherlands (LSD in small amounts). The seller has told me that he shipped it on Monday and attached a "Priority Sticker" to the envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question is, is any buyer/seller who is familiar with shipping/receiving envelopes to Israel aware of how long it would take to ship an envelope (with a priority sticker) from the Netherlands to Israel?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you very much!
    <br/>

    Im in west EU and i occasionally send mdma and coke to a mate in Israel, i always send it by regular mail and it just takes around 10 days to deliver, i only heat seal the product too, their customs is alot more lax than you'd think. Im comfortable enough with it at this stage to guarantee him delivery, never had any problems, although from the NL it could be a different story!
