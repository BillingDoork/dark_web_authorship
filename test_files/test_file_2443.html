    Hello, I am going abroad in a few days and I can get easily some Ecstacy there, 4 times cheaper as I get in my home country, now I thought if I buy like, say, 10 Ecstacy pills, and put them in like a Menthos/any other candy/the like box, can they be noticed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I take a bag of candies in my purse and slip in a few Ecstacy pills, could there go something wrong? How?

    I once wanted to take 4 pills abroad, I just scattered them in my luggage and went off. Then when I ingested them I noticed no wonder they didn't catch them because they were interfeit pills, no effects, I got ripped :(

    Why don't you do this, ask around a little and find a place that will ship something home for you. Say you don't want to carry it with you. Buy something with a hidden compartment that isn't obvious, give it to them to wrap and say you want to put it in the mailbox yourself. If it gets through, you win. If itÂ  gets caught, your $10 purchase and bag of pills have to do hard time in prison. Better them than you.

    The airport is the one place that I won't bother trying to smuggle drugs through....the large airport that I live by has some extreme security and I would be worried to even be questioned just because of my record.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you think you can do it then by all means go for it but I suggest mailing it like someone else said...either way, be careful!
