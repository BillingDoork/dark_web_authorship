    I have an order from a vendor in Germany for MDMA. He recently started offering tracking, so on this order i decided to try it out. All the previous orders have gotten here within 7 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today is Day 8, and anytime i check the tracking it says that on the 7th the German post handed it over to logistics to be forwarded to U.S.A
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's been saying that for 5 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I guess my question is, is this normal? I figured they would update as it got the U.S. and then the sorting center etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I just being paranoid or are they just holding my package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for any help

    you are just paranoid
    <br/>
    its normal for eu&gt;usa orders,,if you send from usa&gt;eu it will say the same the only difference is that it would say that post handed it over to logistics to be forwarded to eu/international logistics
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you order will come without problems just be cool :)

    Are you tracking it directly at the USPS website?  If not, try that.  The foreign post only tracks it until they hand it off to the USPS.  For tracking updates withing the US, you need go to the USPS website, AFAIK.

    no.....sorry but thats not how to do it, use duck duck go as your search engine and search "tracking number"  there are plenty of good 3rd party sites that offer tracking for msot every major shipping service....I would highly reccomend you use anything BUT the USPS site to track it, that will keep you on the safe side of any hypothetical about tracking and raising flags.
