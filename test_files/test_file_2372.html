    Hi everyone,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am new to SR, specializing in smuggling service via EU borders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am able to provide this service, if you want bypass the import custom duties and taxes.
    <br/>
    Electronics like notebooks, or mobile phones, are cheaper in US than in EU, but shipping prices and import taxes are making
    <br/>
    the prices equal(30%+), i think that this is a good money-making long-term business and also i am looking for business
    <br/>
    partners, who are able to appreciate this service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am curious, if it will be some interest in this service here?
    <br/>
    If yes, we must figure out how to make it secure and anonymous for both sides, any ideas are welcome.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    !!! I don't want do this with drugs and weapons !!! its only for electronics, clothing, furniture, motor parts etc...
    <br/>

     if you're confident in your abilities to smuggle it should not matter what you are actually smuggling. if you dont expect 98%+ success rate you dont have any business smuggling anything at all....and if you do, i dont see why it matters if it's drugs.

    Thank you for answer,
    <br/>
    yes you right, I just don't want to doing this with drugs, moral issue... but i am doing this service for 3years and never had any problem 8)
    <br/>
    I just don't have any feedback here, because I am new in deepweb, but its time to start making a name here. Its a great sector, for this kind of service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe I will find here some business-minded people with great ideas not only about drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For first customers : !!! I don't want any money before you get item into your hands !!! , we could use escrow method, its save for both sides.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Our provision is 10% of product price (its including shipping from USA to EU,customs and taxes), size doesn't matter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be free to ask
