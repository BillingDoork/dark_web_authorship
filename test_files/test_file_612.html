    Hello all!
    <br/>
    I am fairly new to the road and to the forums and have a very important question for the community!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In countries where there is no connection between the address and the name on the mail would it be more stealthy to use a
    <br/>
    fake business or company name to make it look legitimate on a professional 'business' letter or would it be just as good to use
    <br/>
    a real/fake personal name?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Soon heading for my first international order and would like some advice from the community!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS. Using my real name is not possible/relevant since its not being shipping to my address.
    <br/>
    Many thanks Garlow :D
    <br/>

    I would personally use my real name if i was having something posted to my address it looks a lot less suspect if your name is on the package rather than some completely made up alias, you can always deny you ever ordered the package and it is usually a good idea to write 'return to sender' on it and leave it a couple of days before opening. Having a fake name on your package just leads to more problems and questions from LE.
