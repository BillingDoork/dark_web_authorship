    Hey,
    <br/>
    I am interested in starting to buy pounds from Canada and having them sent to the east coast, my problem is 1.) I am scared of customs seizing it 2.) I would start to get 1-2 pounds every 2 weeks, but having them sent to the same address. So my question is how many packages do you think I can send to my address without raising a red flag, and the probability of it passing customs if I am usuing a well known vendor? Thanks

    no offense but your asking questions that really cant be answered. I mean with pounds you could get get nabbed on first order or go for months and be fine, Its like rolling dice.
    <br/>
    my advice would be find a good domestic vendor who is willing to work with what you want and do it that way!
    <br/>
    no customs
    <br/>
    less chance of getting knocked. but thats my thoughts. but other than that, no one can tell you how many packs you can order before you get a red flag, I mean i dont think there is a # unless you get one found! so, do some research and goodluck

    chances are the first LB would get seized..
    <br/>
    Canadian Customs.. lul. they are going to open it..
    <br/>
    and in order for someone to hide a pound of dank in a stealthy manner...
    <br/>
    well... let's say they'd have to hide it in some pretty big shit.
    <br/>
    good luck.

    If you get it from a reliable vendor like mr.ouid I dont see any problems. I think Canadian customs are pretty relaxed. Just my .02btc

    well, the only advice I can give you is - start buying a lot from eBay (maybe it's going to be your cover business))))
    <br/>
    <br/>
    dunno much about customs these days..

    MR is good, but he's been iffy lately. not really sure seeing as i don't personally fux with em.
    <br/>
    i talk to a few people who do though.
    <br/>
    and as long as you're not trying to send an LB all at once, you'll be fine.
    <br/>
    but you'd better bust it into quarter LB packages.. and then it is still risky.
    <br/>
    there are SO MANY awesome domestic MM Vendors. :)
    <br/>
    browse around.. don't fuck yourself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NO OFFENSE TO MROUID.

    Unless you are using different, disposable addresses each time, shipping pounds (of anything) repeatedly is not a good idea.
    <br/>
    If even one shipment is intercepted, the drop is likely to be heavily scrutinized if not outright raided.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do your best to ensure your mail-to addresses are drug and tor free, guys! Just in case  ;)

    Look at this thread, the guy is selling custom made unmanned delivery drones undetectable by radar. Get a supplier somewhere along the US/CA border, get the drone, pack, and fly it into the US. His drones come with a custom latch that drops off the load with a parachute. You can do up to 11lbs per drop, and multiple drops per day, his units fly at 200-300km/hr so you'll get it over the border quick and back in time for another load.

    Not so sure about that. If bud is outright illegal in his state (not approved for medical, personal or other uses) he might not necessarily get a customs declaration. Especially for a pound (when shipping bulk it seems that they like to follow the rabbit hole).
