    I live by myself and I think my mailman is on to me.  He seems like he would like drugs and I'm paranoid he might have stolen my most recent package.  I'm not gonna go into details but that's my story.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm only 22 and my lease isn't in my name so I can't open a P.O. box because I don't have a non-photo ID.  Is this the end of Silk Road for me or do you have any ideas for me (assuming I don't receive this package)?  I don't have any friends I can have my package sent to so that doesn't work.  Help me out.  Thanks.

    I don't wanna offend you fella, but sound a bit paranoid to me. Kinda over-thinking the situation.

    He probably knows your name because he delivers your mail everyday.

    Plus, "He's some schemey 40-50 year old black guy who definitely likes to do drugs"... how can you possibly know that?

    imo, you just need to wait. Seriously. After your package arrives, you'll feel a fool for pitting yourself though all this mindfuck.

    I really hope you're right man.  I do tend to overthink things so maybe I am just being paranoid, I just have a bad feeling about this especially.  Fingers crossed it all works out.  But if not there's not anything I can do?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will any sellers ship it to me UPS or Fed-ex or is there a reason people only offer USPS?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe I can get a voter registration card (apparently this is an acceptable form of ID to open a PO box. Hmm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit:  I just found out you can use a utility bill as your non-photo ID for a PO Box.  I kind of want to open a PO box anyway as it seems safer so probably a good idea.

    Just gotta wait til Monday cuz of this blizzard damn!

    I know what you mean those schemey 40-50 year old black mail guys who definitely like to do drugs are easy to spot, my advice get some tin foil....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just kidding but you are reading to much into it I used to think my mail guy was on to me and you know actually I think he does know hes young seems like a trendy hip sort of guy but I think hes cool with it as long as I dont take the piss and give them a reason to check then its cool. I always make sure my vendors stealth is up to the job its all about the stealth you could have the best product in the world and if your stealth was shit then Id say no thanks but no thanks.

    When I first started with SR, I thought the same....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Turned out, it was just the vendors who were scamming me, lol(and my ridiculous customs...)

    <br/>
    But after seeing my mail(wo)man and it was a ~50 y/o woman, I started thinking otherwise...

    Think of it this way, for the mailman, it's his job to deliver the packages, if your packages aren't reeking of weed, then you'll have 0 problems, because if he'd steal a package he'd get fired and if he can't smell it from the outside, then he'd have no assurance that you wouldn't go whining to the post station.

    I know you're right but I don't see what stops him from taking a package home, opening it, and if it turns out it's not drugs he can just repackage it and deliver it the next day.

    <br/>
    And thank you very much.  I was gonna make another order today but now I'm hesitant.  Hopefully it does come in the next few days.

    Repackaging isn't as easy as it seems, it would need to have the postmarks and the stamps and everything on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's more likely that he blatantly would steal it than that plan happening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But as I said, it's too much of a risk and I don't think he'd do that.

    sarcasm is difficult to read on an internet forum (that was not sarcasm btw)

    so, OP, hows your mailman, you been watching him?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    why dont you offer him a refreshing beverage, start up a conversation and ask him if he likes to 'party' (not in a gay way though, unless that sort of thing floats your boat)

    Damn you're right.  I'm not sure if he was being sarcastic or playing it off as sarcasm.  All good though...

    I'm done with this thread though, unless a week goes by and I still don't have my package.  I'm starting to think now that I am just being paranoid.  Time will tell. Bye.

    Should be.  My exact area didn't get too hit to bad at all but I guess other parts of the city and surrounding areas got hit real bad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The guy I'm ordering from seems to have mixed reviews on time of arrival, some say 5-6 days and other as much as 11 in the states, so that gives me some hope at least.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really hope you guys are right and I'm wrong! I don't usually like being wrong, but I'll definitely make an exception for this one.

    Winter storm Nemo
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The U.S. Postal Service continues its recovery efforts from the effects of Winter Storm Nemo and will provide updates on delivery services to homes and businesses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    States most affected by the storm are: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Safe road passage and snow removal remains critical to resuming normal operations. For letter carriers to deliver your mail safely, we ask that steps and walkways be cleared of snow and ice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Curbside mailboxes should be shoveled for letter carriers to deliver or collect mail without having to leave their vehicles. The area near the mailbox should be cleared to provide letter carrier access.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will I receive mail delivery?
    <br/>
    Mail service impacts
    <br/>
    Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All post office operations and mail delivery resumed in the impacted areas Monday, Feb. 11, except for the following ZIP Codes:
    <br/>
    <br/>

    hey bro why dont u order a fake id off of SR and open a P O since u dont wanna use your id?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bet the vendor ust scammed you and has sent nothing.. Is the order US TO US or a international order? Write the vendor and ask him to check the tracking, even though tracking has been fucked up like crazy lately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also its not weird for a diffrent mail deliverer to drop off your mail.. U know mail workers have days off and have others run their routs, at least its normal here. I have a Guy come on certain days and my rgular mail lady most everyday of the week.. I think your lookin to much into this with the mail guy thing..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How many times have u orderd from here? Allot to where u get soo many packages its suspect? But even then unless your vendor just didnt trupple vac seal your order if its weed they hav no way to know ..
