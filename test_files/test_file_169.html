    Hi everybody! I am happy to be part of the Road for a couple of good months now. I researched as much as I could before making my first purchases and everything went fine. I am fortunate enough to live in an apartment complex where a lot of mail gets delivered and one mailbox was still free and unused. I decided to use a fake name andÂ  tested it with ordering some small things from the clearweb, both domestic and from Europe. I live in Europe myself, so no problems there, everything got delivered as expected, both "normal" and sensitive mail ordered from the Road. With my last order however, I had the following problem: I got a notice from the postman to pick it up at the Post Office, which is unusual in my opinion, given that the mail was small, fitted in any mailbox, regular, non-tracked and not even priority, sent out from a European country with no flags on it!
    <br/>
    What do you think? Is the mailbox compromised? Was it some glitch from the postman? Any thoughts, advice and comments would be appreciated!
    <br/>

    It happens sometimes, I'm assuming it's addressed to a fake name though? in which case how are you going to collect?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've read multiple threads on here describing the same scenario as yours and all have worked out fine, that said though I know I'd be suss as hell having to go collect something, if it was only a small order you may want to cut your losses and just let it go.

    Yeah that's my question too, how are you going to collect it if it has another name on it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway I wouldn't go to the post office, most times it's fine but sometimes it's not.

    I get packages the exact same way, I live in an apartment complex in EU and get my SR mails from the shared mailbox. I have decided to never accept any package in person, and if something like this happens to take the loss and move on.

    Thanks for the input, guys! Collecting wouldn't be such a big problem, as they usually hand the package out to whoever can present the note left by the postman and given the fact that it was non-tracked and non-priority! But as the order was small and not worth the risk by any means, I'll leave it and move on. This only leaves me with the problem that the mailbox may be compromised. I guess I'll wait a while and then test it with a package from the clearweb... ::)
