    I know that most everyone agrees that a vaccuum sealer is important and also to print labels, make it look like business reply mail, make it even, no extra tape, no obvious fake return addresses or names etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But the real question is, with a substance like heroin, that only has a very small vinegar like smell (VERY SMALL) can the narcotics dogs detect this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean, if i didn't vacuum seal it and left it in the ballloon added like one or two extra bags, would that suffice?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know that the dogs are mainly trained to go after a toy with a weed scent on it and i do know that they train different dogs to go after different scents. I don't know how good the electronic sniffers are though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry just for my knowledge, can you please explain the proper way to ship HEROIN and the reasons for it? Thank you in advance to you contributions to my knowledge.Â  :)

    Anybody who answers you with any detail, especially on the public forum, is being very foolish.

    dogs can be trained to smell anything. cadaver dogs. bomb dogs. drugs dogs. yes dogs are trained to smell for all types of drugs including heroin, weed, mdmA, prescription opiates and everything else. I remember a dogs nose is a thousand times stronger then ours

    Dogs can likely smell it through 3 vac sealed bags within a few days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your safely relies in the amount of mail that goes through the system and the lack of drug dogs going over each peice of mail.

    But dogs have a very good nose, hence why they're trained to do that sort of job. Just because it is a weak smell to you, does NOT mean that they would miss it just because it is a lesser odor/quantity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to know how to ship H, order from a couple reputable vendors and gather an idea from that.

    The best way to get product passed dogs is after vacuum sealing the package a few times, cover it with high quality pepper or bear spray and then vacuum seal it again. Yes, this can be extremely messy and potentially hazardous, but the spray fucks with the dogs receptors in their nose and leaves them unable to detect any smell.
