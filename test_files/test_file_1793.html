    I'm considering buying a seller account as I have a product not currently available and I have no doubts that it would be popular. However I don't understand how I'm supposed to ship it, especially internationally. I can get my head around the technical side of it but once I have my produced packaged, labeled and ready to ship, what do I do with it?

    You wont need to know this even if you do buy a sellers account because you wont be taking large orders for a while. If you can't work it out then perhaps it's best you don't do large amounts or vend at all.

    There's a very large online auction site called eBay: you might have heard of it.  Postal workers send millions of packages every day which were bought and sold on eBay.  There are many people who use their eBay sales for a supplemental income and a few who even earn a living working from home.  If your packages look and smell like typical eBay packages you should have no worries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IOW, don't overthink this stuff.  Vacuum seal where appropriate and make your package look like something somebody might have ordered from a trinket vendor and you're golden.  At the end of the day, you're just another small online businessperson.

    Well the packages I received were all the same, identical envelope, shipping label and return address. I won't post the vendor but it's a big one and has possibly shipped thousands of orders. Obviously I could walk into a post office and just send them, but anyone who wanted to know could find out what my packaging looked like and if one of my packages were found surely they could see it was me who sent it from CCTV.

    Working it out is what I'm trying to do, national orders I can put in a post box, but anything international surely requires visiting a post office and dealing with someone face to face.
