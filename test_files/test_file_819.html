    So, first things first I have to say this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This post is not intended in any way to badmouth a certain vendor, or to claim they are at fault for a current non arrival. Im here to ask the opinions of more experienced SR buyers into my situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am not going to mention ANY names here, but If you consistantly receive items from a certain non-flagged country, within 10 full days, and their product is just vac sealed and taped to some paper in an un-assuming envelope, and not to mention the product can be detected by dogs and even if it were "felt up" enough by customs. and then all of a sudden you try a new vendor fromt he same location, sending blotter in a HIGHLY stealth package, like, unbelievably stealth (this is not Tess, but its just as good stealth, if not better.....), and their envelope is yet to arrive after 21 business days, what would you think? Also, if you then contacted said vendor, and they sent you the tracking number for said package, and said that they tracked it and it was last scanned in your city, and then followed that with "check the tracking number for yourself, you can use TOR so it wont implicate you", what would you think about the method the vendor must have used tot track your package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMHO, I feel as if said vendor tracked my package over TOR, got it flagged for extra scrutiny, and now it hasnt pitched. Now like I said thats what I feel has happened, im not saying this is what has happned or that its the vendors fault, im looking for some other opinions on the matter, to help calm me down firstly, and secondly, if this was the fault of a vendor who got my package seized by using TOR to track it, what would you all say the vendor should do to resolve this issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any input would be highly appreciated.
    <br/>

    PS: Said vendor has since cancelled all tracking services on international orders.

    There is a lot of speculation that checking tracking through tor flags packages but there hasn't been any evidence to back that up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless, make sure the drop is clean.Â  The drop should always be clean but I realized it usually isn't for most people.

    Check the tracking number yourself and see where its at. I personally don't believe checking it via tor sets off any red flags, as I use that on all my packages and none have been seized. But yeh, check the number yourself and see if it has gotten to your city or not.
