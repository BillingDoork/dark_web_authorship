    Hi!
    <br/>
    Quick question for LSD sellers. Do you vacuum pack LSD? or is it not really a necessity, I´ve heard that there a very few dogs trained to be able to detect it. It wont show up in x-ray scans as biological  if surrounded with paper or card and that the quantity required for dog detection is high,. i.e they would be more able to smell out the blotting paper than the LSD thats on it.

    I have never seen it sealed. Not only is it incredible hard to detect, it is very hard to train dogs to detect it without messing up the dogs. Even a pile of raw crystal is going to be practically oderless
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is just paper as far as any scanner goes. Easiest of the drugs to smuggle in my opinion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, a google search of "dogs smelling lsd" gives many opinions.

    Opinions differ on this, but I cant find a reason to not vac-seal.
    <br/>
    If a vendor finds that too difficult/expensive just add 1-2$ in shipping.
    <br/>
    No reason to risk it imo.

    Yeah, I guess its better safe than sorry. The heat from the sealing process wouldn´t begin to destroy the chemical though would it?

    Does it not use heat to seal the bag after sucking the air out? I was thinking on a small package with just a few tabs that because the filaments that heat the plastic so it seals are so close to the tabs that some heat might be transferred? LSD is not partial to heat, thats the only thing that worries me.

    Ah, I know the packages you're referring to.  The bags I use are re-usable.  They come in different forms but most are like ziplock bags that you either push to seal, or there is a little sliding sealer thing like on some bags.  I can't think of the name of it to save my life lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, after you seal it up there is a little... flap or something I have no idea... that you use to suck the air out with some kind of vacuum.  Works just as well as the heat sealed bags in my experience.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They sell the bags and many kind of vacuums (my favorite is handheld and cordless!) at Wal-Mart, and they're not that expensive at all considering what you get with them. (and they're re-usable!!)

    It is necessary, because LSD molecule degrades in touch with air, so blotters should be stored in vacuum to keep their maximum potency when you get 'em. Moreover that way it's almost impossible to detect, unless vendor packed it really bad...   Well, some vendors vacuum seal and some don't...

    In my experience, it takes quite a lot of time and a good bit of air to noticeably degrade a blotter.  Case in point: I left an unwrapped 5-strip sitting in my nightstand for about 6 months (I forgot about it lol).  When I went back to go eat the thing, I noticed that two hits wasn't quite as strong as before but it was definitely a lot stronger than just one.  So yeah, it did degrade when it was completely unprotected for 6 months, but not as much as you'd think.

    Hmmmm, Interesting...   Well, do the blotters were exposed to light also?  I think LSD degrades more from light and heat than air.
    <br/>
    Quoted from somewhere : "The fastest way to degrade and destroy LSD would be extreme heat and then next would be direct UV rays (sun light.) Oxidation (including exposure to the air) can very slowly degrade the LSD also."

    Nope.  No light and no heat. They were kept in a drawer and my house usually stays around 68 degrees F.  That was in response to the vacuum sealing question. Just saying if you ship LSD and it only stays in the mail for a few days, then I don't think vacuum sealing is necessary; however, it can never hurt!!
