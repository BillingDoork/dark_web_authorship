    If I were to import something from over seas into Aus would it be smart to have the package addressed to a former tenant that lived here 6-8 months ago? We still get his mail from time to time.

    What kind of mail of theirs do you receive?  Is it junk mail only?  If it is junk mail only then don't.

    Beware of old tennants going to the post office and getting mail redirected - maybe a long shot after that amount of time.

    But you never know..................... and thats reason enough to be wary

    Before you ever consider having something shipped to you under another name, send yourself a test letter addressed to that name. If you don't receive it, don't use that name.

    If you're serious about doing this, i would think your best bet would be to use domestic mail only. Stick to first class. I've never seen a company send out junk mail using priority. Let us know how it goes. I highly recommend that you use your real name at your address though.

    if you get alot of mail under this name going to your address then an envelope to the name is a good idea it will be disguised

    I love using this idea, however you do need to test to be sure the previous occupant does not have a forwarding order (which would not apply to 3rd class junk mail so you could be deceived). You need to also test to see if you have an overly OCD postman who sends it back because they know it's an old tenant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After the test, or if you frequently get first class mail for them, then it is a go! I happily use this technique.
