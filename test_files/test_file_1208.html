    Hi there,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Relatively new here, and I hate to annoy you seasoned users with my beginner questions, but I have only been on the road for a couple of months.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is my first larger order. I will be getting it from Belgium to Denmark, all from the same vendor, and in total it will be around 3 ounces in different (very potent) strains. The vendor knows what he is doing, excellent stealth, but I am still slightly paranoid about placing such a large order. On the other hand I hope for some quantity discount, and I don't see a reason to hold on to my bitcoins for longer than necessary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reasoning behind my paranoia is: Belgium, with its relaxed drug policy is a flagged country, so getting several/1 bigger package might be more suspicious, not to mention I have already received 2 other international packages just last month. Does all these things matter at all, or is this actually so "small-scale" that I shouldn't be frightened at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some insight would be much appreciated!
    <br/>

    i wouldn't put Belgium in the same league as NL as a 'flagged' country. if the vendors packaging is good enough you should be ok - i've had 100g of coke delivered to me (UK) from Mexico, and the packaging was sweet so no problems there.

    you can't help shitting yourself from the moment you hit 'order' until it's hit your doorstep and you've moved it though

    Thanks for the reply! Much appreciated! No ordering it on SR sure beats going out into the ghetto, but man the whole shipping process keeps me awake at night. None the less, I love this system, so much better
