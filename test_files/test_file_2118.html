    yes, i have ordered  3 times from a vendor. Always different address..ect. Any way, It went in bound into customs and then 45minutes later was inbound out. Which is the fastest i have ever seen! I do no know if this is good or bad? Anyway  last 2 times it went to a town in the same state as the customs and then was sorted and departed, Arriving in my state the day after. Now, it has not said anything since inbound out of customs. Which worries me. I mean i thought i was in the clear when it said that. Now, it does not seem to have even left the customs facility?
    <br/>
    I am sure someone has some advise or similar circumstances? I mean i do not know to think if it has not left, never scanned, or do not even want to say it but you know... the worst. I mean it has always went to the next facility and then arrived in my local office and is delivered? I know with the weekend but still it was out bound of customs before the weekend and in the early afternoon. So, let me know what you think please from vets to newbies who had any similar happens....?
    <br/>
    remember we got to stick together! And some feed back would be nice
    <br/>
    thank you all in advance!

    Can you detail exactly what you mean when you wrote - "It went in bound into customs and then 45minutes later was inbound out"? Just need to clarify exactly what you mean before I answer your post. :) What country was it coming from? PM me if you want to keep the country of origin private.
