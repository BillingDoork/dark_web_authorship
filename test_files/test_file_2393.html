    I am new user here and want to what the risk of ordering from a country outside of the U.S. is...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to order 1g of MDMA and then another gram of MDA separately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While scrolling through listings, I notices that there are a handful or reputable sellers that have been here for a while, I figured it is logical to go with one of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I noticed for MDMA, there is only one U.S. seller. I also noticed, that their price was nearly DOUBLE that of the other listing from all over EU, yet still have a large base of customers,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This signaled to me, that it may be extremely risky to order from other countries, as why would people order the same quality product (more or less) for nearly double?  does this mean the risk of interception/confiscations is nearly double as it costs half as much? And most sellers have a policy that if you're new, you don't get escrow or any sort of compensation for lost goods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have messaged many of the sellers without a reply at all. Figured asking here would be best.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless, I'm going through with this, but if the risk is equal and the price is just an odd fluke or something, I'd order abroad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is risky, by how much? Which countries are more risky? After reading that thread about the guys testing the drug dog, and it being able to find MDMA on first chance is pretty discouraging...

    as a noob myself.. i have done both routes and had success with both.. my first being a domestic gram of mdma and second being some pills from the uk..  ive always stayed under the radar ordering personal use amounts.. if you order bulk, the stealth may not be as great and id hate to be the victim of a controlled delivery if customs opens it and goes the extra mile to nail you for distribution quantity, otherwise your stuff would just get seized and probably get a love letter from customs and end the use of that address.... and yes, domestic is almost double the price.. it does come way quicker..but sometimes not that much quicker.. some intl orders have been coming in pretty quick.. 5-7 days.. with most on average about a week and half to 2 weeks.. if you've read the stats, you have a 97-98% chance of getting your stuff which is fantastic.. as long as your vendor knows how to package well and the vendor's country is not flagged in your country and you're in escrow, you should be fine..(ie, if you're in the US, avoid the Netherlands.. go with UK or Germany instead)..  the thing that scares me about domestic is the vendor being busted by local police and your address being compromised..  at least if the intl vendor was busted in their home country, i doubt theyd go out of their way to alert the receiving country about your address..  so its pretty much 50/50 for both.. whenever I want to order a larger quantity, I would go intl since the prices are definately better.. and just read the reviews well of your vendors on both their feedback and on the forums and you should be golden..

    <br/>
    just my 2 cents..
