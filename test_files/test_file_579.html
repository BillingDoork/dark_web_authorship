    letter said it would be abandoned if not claimed in 30 days. and they said they tried to contact the sender and recipient but i received no such contact. and the sender address doesn't exist. the package was a overflowing small priority box. everything was suspicious about the package. handwriting, single layer vacuum sealing and no tape over the priority box adhesive. inside of the package was a less than a oz of multiple drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    should i post a picture minus my details? not gonna be making drops to that address ever again. but other than that looks like coast is clear. the vendor has been notified of their sloppiness and I will see how they respond before i reveal the name.

    To be fair, I'm sure most people that use SR never feel the need to make an account on the forums, they only do if something goes wrong.  I agree its suspicious but everybody has to make their first post at some point.

    LOL DUMBASS!! This is a business, if something is wrong YOU COMPLAIN. The buyers have the ultimate say in who vends here but people keep on buying through shitty vendors and since they recieved their product once they think it will arrive again and they give them 5/5. If they did something wrong you rate them lower and get their name out there so the rest of the community knows. Thats what the point of this system is! Then that vendor will either try to correct it or they will leave. And then we continue from there. But please share your experiences including the vendors name unless they have corrected their mistakes and even in that case still let people know what happened so the public is aware. AND DON'T SETTLE FOR SHITTY PACKING!! Bitch and bitch till they get it right. You are risking your entire freedom because of this site and people get to god damn lazy about their safety. BE FUCKING SMART!! Rant over.

    So fucking true. If a vendor does you wrong bring it to their attention and give them a chance to address the situation before you go public.  Any vendor worth a lick will go out of the way to fix it. If it IS their fault they will.  If they don't, fuck em'. Those type don't need to be here anyways.  Don't ever let a vendor try to intimidate you or think they have the upper hand. Don't disrespect them either. They are offering a service not many of us are willing to do, but lots of us benefit from. We are all equally in this together when it comes to our freedom.  Sure, some have more financially to lose, a lot more actually.  But ultimately we all have our freedom to lose and fucked up packaging leads to loss of it.  Fuck anyone who's not willing to respect that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for your situation, as others have said, I would have never placed another order with that vendor if the shit was as sloppy as you say.  I think sometimes these deals go so smooth people take it for-granted that this shit is actually illegal. Chalk it up as a loss and lay low for a while. With your free time you can work on your own security practices and hopefully this will end up OK and be your last dance with danger.

    I think you are 100% correct about that. Also, I think that the reason we dont hear about long time SR users who get caught getting busted is because they think it is in their best interest to keep it a secret. I am sure any lawyer, and or LEO would strongly suggest that sort of thing for the person's own well being. Unfortunate for us to a certain extent but really when it comes down to it people will be caught, and people will talk. It happens. All we can do is look out for ourselves here right and remain as anonymous as possible.
    <br/>
    There is also the possibility that not too many people have been arrested. I only know of one vendor who got caught and is probably doing hard time right now. The good thing about this site is that its hard to get info out of a person about others because of the anonymity, that is this sites saving grace in my opinion. Seems like if the vendors take necessary precautions they can have much success here.

    I care MORE about GOOD STEALTH packaging than I do product quality.  Usually I can get a ballpark idea from a vendor's reviews about the quality of the product, so I know about what to expect.  It's only with  three orders that I've made (out of 67, I think) that I've not been satisfied with the packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Two were  new vendors that I was taking a chance on. Neither are around anymore, one of them is and it's a guy I use regularly now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The worst was one where the guy put 2 grams of bud into a small Aleve bottle and didn't even put the top on it, threw it in a plain white envelope (sealed thankfully) and put that into a priority envelope.  When I got the envelope (I don't know how it made it to me, it STANK and was actually really good bud) and it looked like it had been bitten by a dog.  The envelope looked like it had teeth marks on it and the Aleve bottle even had a hole that looked like a bite mark.  Absolutely no idea what happened there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next, was one where it was a new vendor and the guy told me he "triple vacuum sealed" all his orders.  Well, it came in a ziplock bag shoved in some newspaper in a priority box.  If it had been AAA grade bud as advertised, it would have stunk.  Instead, it was 3 - 4 harvest old beasters that were totally compressed and had almost no smell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally, there was an issue that I had with a reputable and prominent vendor that is active now about shipping labels.  It was just printed on a piece of computer paper, cut with scissors and taped onto the box with the corners loose and didn't look professional at all.  I was shocked because I had used this vendor before and the stealth was always good but it turned out someone other than normal was packing boxes for him/them for a while.

    <br/>
    When I get a package I expect it to look like something is being delivered to me from a reputable business.  I stopped giving new vendors a try after being lied to about their stealth, unless they give out samples and sample reviews cite good stealth.

    <br/>
    But yes, you NEED TO COMPLAIN! I didn't go on the forums back when I experienced it, but I gave one of the guys a 4 of 5 (bud was good quality, it got to me and he was a new vendor and I didn't ask about his stealth) and the other a 2 of 5 (weed was terrible and stealth was terrible, but it made it to me).  The other guy, I of course gave a 5 of 5 because he has been perfect every other time and it wasn't his fault.   It's your duty to let the community know what happened so that no others risk losing their freedom!

    Regarding the OP's legitimacy, I of course don't know but what he is saying sounds more believable than a lot of the 'I got busted' posts.  The thought of getting a  Love Letter doesn't really bother me too much, so I don't think it's a great scare tactic if that is what it is.
