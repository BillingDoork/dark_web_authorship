    Hey All,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone suggest a good o/s supplier of coke that they have had success with in say the last couple of months? I am only looking for very recent successes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Reading the forums I can see many have had success in the past but there strike rate has seem to fallen dramatically of late. This has led many to start claiming selective scamming by suppliers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look forward to your help.
    <br/>

    too hard to differentiate between selective scammers and customs so I am cutting that shit out before I develop a full blown habit. Nada getting through for me recently so going back to good old Aus local prices...keeps me doing less... and more importantly, keeps the hardcore criminals in business!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good work customs..good work!

    between $300 and $400, normally $350. Not a dealer sorry. Too risky and I hate people/telephones
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People claim SR coke is better than Aus local... That might be true if you are under 30 and have no friends in finance / politics / law... the dodgy professions!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I only use SR so I can get on the toot like a fucking fiend, not because the quality is better.

    My personal opinion is that it has little to do with the olymics and much more to do with all the publicity SR has been getting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would suggest that customs have allocated more resources to mail. It might be a short term blitz or something more long term.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bring on a local supplier I say!!

    You could try MIA (moveitaussie) - he should have local product in soon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm convinced that one of the reasons that product is taking so much longer to arrive is because customs / AQIS are holding mail for longer. This gives the molecules a chance to get through the bags (even triple vac sealed) which in turn increases the chance of detection by dogs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But maybe they're just sticking a pin in every envelope :)

    Out of similar frustration I ordered from 5 newish vendors with reasonable reviews in various threads. 1g sample each. Pretty much reckoned if 1 out of 5 came through then I'm almost breaking even on local prices. Orders put in on the 15th.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So far only 1 has arrived (on the 24th), but packaging was disappointing (not vacuum sealed) - so to me that's a fail too because I won't reorder.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once I get some through hopefully in the next 1-2 weeks I'll come report back. Or PM me for details.

    I have a 100% success rate so far and one on the way but most of you Aussies probably won't buy from me, I have a no refund policy because my shipping methods are very stealthy so I won't be able to decide whether you're scamming me or not.
