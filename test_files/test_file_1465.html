    Question for the risk reduce.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Analogical situation: I have 1 kg of cannabis and I'm in Spain, I need to get to Germany. I can send it via courier or I can drive the whole way myself. But I think it's better to drive myself.
    <br/>
    So what are the recommendations, should I get a friend who drives ahead and gives me signals if there are border control or police raid. What to do if I don't have that friend? Do I need a whole better system than I can imagine at the moment or it's easy? Or should I just stay with postal service and bite my nails for half of the week.
    <br/>
    Are some crossing points better than others and why?  I'm eager to know all the details you guys can imagine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank You!

    I cant tell you about the risks of driving but I cant understand how it could be cost effective for just 1KG.
    <br/>
    I know weed is cheap in spain and all but you can still get bulk in Germany for E5/Gram

    Well when I was in Luxembourg on business for a few months I went through France and German borders nearly every day and never seen any sort of checkpoints. Outside of that  I don't know.
    <br/>
    Met cops on the train from Amsterdam to Brussels however but that's to be expected

    There is a shed loada latitude in that question . It depends on so many things . If you take the time to pack it right ( seal in MMB ,wash with Acetone , change gloves ,seal in MMB ,wash with Acetone change gloves ,seal in MMB wash with Acetone change gloves) that would see your parcel safely through but if you're sitting in a shit car that has issues or your face/attitude don't fit you will still be screwed no matter what your packings like . All of that goes with the postal route too , packing it in a sterile enviroment will do you no good if it looks shabby or just plain wrong . The ppl that screen this/us do this shit day in day out of years and they can spot abnormal from a mile off . Good luck  8)
