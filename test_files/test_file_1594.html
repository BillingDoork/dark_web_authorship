    Hi guys.  I work during the day and go to college in the evenings and nobody is usually home during the day.  (I wouldn't feel comfortable with someone other than me accepting the mail anyway; what if they find out it's drugs??)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do most small orders in the US that you have received get put in the mail box or does the post man bring it to your door?  I'm also just thinking about opening a PO box to use for banking/school and might as well use that for SR anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any feedback would be appreciated

    If it's a small package and it fits in the mailbox, it goes in the mailbox.

    if you need it to fit through the door best to specify it to the vendor, although i've had two vendors flat out ignore my request to make the package small enough to fit, for some reason some vendors seem reluctant to compress weed, even when you ask them!

    I would recommend a PO box. Safer and try and figure out how to open it anonymously.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if a buyer did request me to compress I would, however I can see how if a vendor had 40 orders to process in one day how she/he might forget.

    and i can understand that as well which is why i specify that i need it to be compressed before, during and after making the order, the last vendor who did't compress for me (you know who i mean whiteshark) just flat-out refused, wasn't a mistake at all. The other option Snowden is to pay a friend 10% of the package to recieve it for you if you don't think its going to fit through the postbox
