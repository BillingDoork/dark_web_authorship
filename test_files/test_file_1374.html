    I have finally decided to release it... People complain over this so much about not being able to figure this out... use your heads, it's not hard. Here are a few methods I have personally used and rationalized....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Method1) Get a fake ID, order the tracking labels "General Delivery" to the post office. You do not need a PO box to order things to the post office. I have done this numerous times. Order them to the post office(google how to do this, it's easy)... when they arrive there, show up and say something like you are inbetween moving houses(to avoid questions) and that you ordered a package here under General Delivery under whatever name is on your Fake ID. They will go find your package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While this method isn't 100% full-proof, it is easy, but CAN be full proof if you take a few precautions. If the labels were traceable, the most they could do is find out the label was sent to the Post Office to some fake name. See when the package was accepted since the labels are mailed with tracking(from stamps.com at least). If they were traced this far they could try to get the cameras for that time/date, but that's the most they can do. If the can't ID you on the camera.... or you use a friend with a fake ID to get the package and give it to you, then there's simply no way they will discover you. Just wear a hat and take basic precautions to hide your face from the camera. Use common since. If they can't ID your face then they're really at a dead-end. Though I personally doubt they would ever get this far in the first place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Method2) The obvious one. Mail to a mailbox that you can snag it from. On Stamps.com the tracking labels with shipping are 100% free, so you can order up to 200 at a time to anywhere you'd like as often as you'd like. Find a vacant/new house.. What I like to do is go online and look for houses that people are renting out, drive out there and see how close the neighbhors are. Often I can very quickly find a house that has nobody in it, and I just order it there, check the tracking often and when it is delivered, just snag it from the mailbox and be on your way... just don't look suspicious doing it. Look like you're supposed to be there, because snatching mail like this IS a felony.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Method3) Order to a neighbor of a vacant house, when the package is delivered, knock on the that night and say you were about to move into the house next door and mistyped the address when you ordered the package and it got sent there. Apologize and ask if they got it, and mention the tracking, also mention the name on the package. If the person is paranoid they may ID you, and this is where a fake id can come in handy. Whichever ID you use, it is EXTREMELY unlikely they will write down your information and won't remember it for future purposes if police ever come knocking at their door.
    <br/>
    -If you think they won't ID you, put a fake/realistic looking name on the package and just pick it up. The problem with putting your real name is that it is in the websites database that you ordered it from, which can be a problem. Fake ID can come in handy. You could just talk your way out of it.... if you don't seem like an asshole and can act like you are being serious and made a legitimate mistake, they will likely just hand it right to you. Having tracking numbers handy can be useful. I have pulled this one off many times acting as if it was an honest mistake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have personally tried all 3 of these methods, as well as a few others. I prefer the 2nd or 3rd one, but I am always trying out new techniques for the fuck of it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully more vendors will be able to use tracking now thanks to this... I'm going to bed now. Enjoy.

    The first two are basic, known "drop" techniques. The third one is original, but not a very good idea. Either way, though, it's nice to get another take on the tracking issue. Good stuff, friend. +1

    that's a lot of extra work just to receive some labels. are you sure its totally untracable. Afterall the post office has cameras. Good ideas though

    I don't think anything is untraceable, though it sounds like these ideas will definitely make it more work for them. Tracking labels are important to vendors so as to prevent scamming and what not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally don't think tracking labels can be traced very easily... since they're free, they like receive thousands of them at a time, and I doubt they track each individual 50 stack. The most they can probably do is LE can find out what batch(of 1000-100,000) tracking labels your label came from, and see anyone from your area who ordered them... and that's it... and unless you live in a very small town, this will not be easy for them. You gotta think any business around your area is going to be ordering these labels, so the list of names may be in the thousands. Unless you're already a suspect, that it will be hard as hell for LE to narrow down that list.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I like this list Veet. My favorite technique is to find houses that are awaiting to be rented out, go talk to the owner and see If your vendor uses enough stealth especially for domestic, it wont matter if the house and what not, act interested in renting, SEE how close the owner lives... if they don't live next-door then just order the labels to that house, tell the owner you will be driving through to check out the neighbhorhood and then snag the package when it gets put in the mail box. There's bound to be obstacles a couple of times, but this is a great way to get tracking labels.... I don't know how some vendors operate without them to be honest...
