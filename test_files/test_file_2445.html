    A quick inquiry and this thread can fade into obscurity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But as an SR member who has had every order come through, i am facing my first that hasn't shown up.
    <br/>
    26 days to date, and no love letter or CD attempt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From the mind of someone more knowledgeable, would you say this is lost?

    I've also noticed very long shipping times for me also. NL to US and UK to US.
    <br/>
    A order that came from the UK took a month to get here.
    <br/>
    One order from NL got here in five days, the rest have yet to show (its been over a month).
    <br/>
    I just took those at a lost and have 3 more orders from NL with different vendors and its been 10 days on all of them.
    <br/>
    Expecting them to come this week by chance.

    duffzilla, 26 days is an awful long time for a package to arrive. Is that business (working) days or are you including weekends? If that is business days only (approx 20 days excluding weekends), it may still be just around the corner obviously depending on where it came from and where it was going to however if its 26 working days, I'd almost say it's gone.

    duffzilla, If you ordered from MIMM, you could have a little problem as other buyers are complaining of packages not turning up and PM's not being answered :(. I must say though, if it's not here this week I'd say it's gone. Sorry to say but Canada to Oz doesn't usually take that long.

    Luckily it was not an order from the vendor you stated. It is from Trojan who has a good track record as far as i can see.
    <br/>
    30 days now and it has not shown up. He has offered a reship which i am grateful for.
    <br/>

    How many packages really go 'missing' ?

    Out of 49 international orders, I've had just 2 packages go "missing". :) When you look at the overall picture, that's nothing when you compare the prices some local vendors want for the same products. ;D
