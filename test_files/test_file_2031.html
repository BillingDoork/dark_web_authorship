    Hello!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered some MDMA from ST and I recieved my tracking link last friday and it said that I would recieve my package monday. At monday it got changed to tuesday, at tuesday it got changed to wednesday and at wednesday it changed to thursday - and at thursday it got changed to friday?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it normal that it happens several times ? How am I going to know if my package gets seized?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you in advance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (I live in Denmark and the package was sent from Netherlands)

    If you look on supertrips review thread and on his page it says the date getting pushed back is normal. however, i haven't heard of Onbekend anywhere yet.

    NL tracking sucks, and is wrong more often than it is right. Chill. But its probably not going to update to delivered if thats what you are wondering about.

    Not necessarily no.  You might get it the next day even for all we know.  It'll say something like held by us customs or something if it's seized.

    If your package has made it into the USA try tracking it through USPS and see where it is.  The delivery date on TNT is known to be pushed back and unaccurate all the time.

    Don't check the tracking # with TOR, I've had packages in NY customs that weren't express mailed, to be held for up to 14 days at times, and yes they contained illegals.  It could just be held up, think positive, until SWAT comes, then you can start bitchin.  Actually that's poor advice :P what I mean to say is, it's really impossible to tell if your package has been intercepted as the tracking would then go dead, it seems live at this point and could be delays.
