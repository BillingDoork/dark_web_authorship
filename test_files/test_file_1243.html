    Does anyone know how to anonymously send something domestically that will only fit in a box about the size of a large suitcase that weighs around 50KG?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I need to ship an item domestically within Australia, and unfortunately the heaviest component is about 50kg and cannot be broken up into smaller parts. I require either tracking or some other proof of delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will give a free 0.5BTC to whoever can provide me with a method, either here or via PM if you prefer.

    Close, not a tablet press, but another type of large machine of dubious legality. I'd prefer not to specify exactly what it is on the forum, however it is made of metal.

    <br/>
    All advice greatly appreciated :)

    Driving it there isn't an option? You might be able to use a courier service like in the USA we have UPS, Fedex, etc. I've had a car exhaust and tires mailed via UPS before. If they will take something that heavy I'd say just box it up and add padding to it. Say it's a... sewing machine, yeah.

    Best hope is to call it something else and hope they don't look into it. I wouldn't try and hide something that big as it may look even more suspicious. It sounds like you are trying to transport a mint or something, lol! Best of luck, and you may want to consider driving it or finding another means of transportation...

    not sure if its really anonymous, but find a mate or someone with a company with regular freight stock orders.

    I could drive it but unfortunately that's not anonymous. I have to be able to drop it off without being on any cameras or revealing my identity, for my own safety. However I can box/package it up any way I like.

    If you want to ship it I think the best way is to use a box of some product/object that has about the same size and weight of what you want to ship and packing it as a transaction in ebay or similar. Try to hide as much as possible the fact that it is not the object that should be inside the box and treat it as you are selling the same as used (so, in this case I always took care that the box was not seemingly too new but as an used box would have been; if instead you want to let pass the object as new the best approach is to use a name of a company that usually sells those products to ship it - this can even be better, assuming you can do it).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've sent myself many times things of high weight that were not exactly what they looked outside and all did go well. True, I am not in the US so I don't know exactly how things works there but nobody here ever checked inside to see if inside there was exactly what advertised in the box if the package seemed legit (i.e. about same weight and size the thing advertised in the box would have). I always packed the thing in a way that it didn't move minimally plus covered the box in wrapping paper all around and all did go good. For how to send it use the usual security parameters for letters (as a legit return address not tied to you, etc.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if you want to be extremely sure that everything will go correctly the only way is surely to drive it there. Pay someone to do that for you in case.

    There are maybe some expensive drones who can lift that if your lucky. Maybe put it under a boat if there is a river or sea or whatever. But at the end of the day there is only one possible way to make this safe: call The Transporter.

    what about a private trucking company?

    <br/>
    i'm not sure how it works in the states or australia but i've sent some car parts that way in europe and nobody wanted to see an ID. just pay cash and give them a fake name for the bill.

    should do the trick if you can live with not getting a delivery confirmation from the company

    i would say your best bet was mentioned above and try and package it to look like something else and get it transported via truck.private courier obviously.

    not sure how you would get it anonymous though i'm afraid.fake id perhaps and find a mate who is a real estate agent to let you use a property for a day.

    i would just ring up a company, ask to speak to despatch, talk to the bloke see if you can use their account, and you'll pay shipping costs and bring in 2 cartons.
    <br/>
    just tell them its big digger bucket or something youre selling secondhand, and no one ships this big and you dont have an account with any freight companies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    package it in to a big pallet box and nail the lid shut, cling wrap it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    probably even better if they had crate boxes laying around, and give them an extra carton :P

    I would build a crate, or you said a suit case size...Would it fit into a empty computer case? A large one or the box that it comes in at least? Or maybe in one of those mini fridge boxes? Well need a box that's nice and sturdy and that can handle that much weight. Pack it up, use plenty of moving tape (It's a lot stronger than your average tape), and make sure to put bubble wrap inside to put padding on it but ultimately to avoid the machine punching any holes on the box during transportation. Next as many mentioned, not sure how AUS works on hiring cargo vans but if you call a local trucking company that does pickups and deliveries for logistics companies, mainly they would do loose cargo (LCL) pickups and ask to hire a cargo van to make a local delivery..They will probably accept cash on pickup and fake name can be given, no id needed.That's probably the best way I can think of for a commodity that size/weight.

    Ah one more thing. Make sure when you give a pickup location to give some random place (Which you probably will do) because they most likely will give some paperwork to sign (BOL) or some kind of sig is needed to confirm delivery.

    If you have any questions just shoot me a PM and I can go into better detail..That is if you didn't ship it out yet.
