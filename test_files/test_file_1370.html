    I shipped an international express package to a customer and I gave him the tracking number two business days after the shipment like my profile states because I don't want them to be tracked immediately and bringing attention to the package.  A customer just messaged me saying my service was great but the package came too fast and no one was home to sign for it so it's now being sent back overseas. ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have never had this problem in all of my years doing this.  USPS always leaves a card to go pick it up from the post office or have it redelivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The customer now expects me to send another order.  My profile clearly states that I send tracking two days after the order is shipped and that a signature is required.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone ever even heard of USPS not leaving a slip for pickup/redeliver and instead just sending the fucking shit back across the ocean? ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have not checked the tracking number myself yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All I know is that I held up my end of the deal perfectly.

    My profile also states the delivery time.  I told the customer what day it was shipped.  He also knew exactly when it would come.  The delivery time was SPOT ON.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package should be at a local post office and they are supposed to leave a card for pickup/redelivery.

    This is indeed a US customer.  I have my policies clearly stated.  The package was shipped.  I have not even checked tracking.  This is not how USPS does business.  I've been doing this for over eight years and I'm not buying this bullshit story.  I'm not buying the story.  USPS does just send packages back overseas when you're not home to accept them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe he used a fake address or something shady that he hasn't told me about.  I don't know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My profile clearly states the deliver time.  I clearly told him the date that it was shipped.  I gave him the tracking number two business days after it was shipped.  I did everything that I was supposed to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the customer doesn't leave a 5/5 then fuck him.  Blacklisted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If he wants to take it to resolution then I am ready any time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe the customer just doesn't know how to read the slip or tracking?  I don't know what is going on honestly.  I'll let resolution check the tracking.  I don't have time for ignorance or scammers.

    I haven't even checked the tracking myself.  I'm just going by what the customer says.  I'll check it if/when we get to resolution and let resolution also check it if that is what it comes to.

    Something isn't right here. There would have for sure been a slip left if the occupant wasn't home at the time of delivery stating the package will be left at the local post office for pick-up after a certain time. I would be checking the tracking Jack to get a better idea of where the package is currently located. I have to agree with you 100% if what your saying is correct. There's no way after one delivery attempt that a package is returned overseas.

    It should, yes.  Jack, if you have a way to do so safely, check the tracking and see what it says.  As it stands, definitely doesn't sound right ...

    I guess they used a fake name AND THEY DID LEAVE A NOTICE/CARD/SLIP but the customer used a fake name so he is now not willing to go retrieve the package from the post office I guess so he just expects me to reship him another order for free.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check out this tracking.  Here is an censored screenshot - http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/eqsr.jpg
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Addressee Unknown [MONTH] [DAY], 2013, [TIME] [CITY], [STATE] [ZIP CODE] PO to Addressee
    <br/>
    Notice Left (No Authorized Recipient Available) [SAME MONTH AND DAY], 2013, [EARLIER TIME] [CITY], [STATE] [ZIP CODE]
    <br/>
    Notice Left (Business Closed) [SAME MONTH AND DAY], 2013, [EVEN EARLIER TIME] [CITY], [STATE] [ZIP CODE]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess the customer fucked up good this time....  Then expected me to send them another order for free.  That is not how it works....

    From what I can see, absolutely. Obviously the buyer has fucked up and in doing so, has tried to recoup their loses from Jack by attempting to spin a tale.

    I completely agree. Using a fake name and address is a risk. If this person wanted to take that risk, they suffer the consequences. Next time they can write their address properly. Idk Jack, maybe you could work with him on a reduced repurchase. not that you have to, just maybe being as he obviously lost some amount of money. But if he insists on not paying for his mistake and forces resolution I can't imagine I would want to help him out either..

    Too many buyers make the mistake of jumping in head first without the knowledge they need to ensure delivery. Not enough homework done by the buyer IMO. Rather, blinded by the thought of a large delivery to their door of a quality product at a great price.

    I'm not crazy.  I can see plain as day what that tracking says.  It says that they did leave a notice.....  He says he used his real name on a friends address so he should have no problem in going to the post office and retrieving his package.  This is REALLY dumb.

    Yeah that is how it sounds.. He thinks you are going to get it back. Which if you were it would make sense for him to pay shipping and have you reship, however this is a pretty stupid assumption. Looks like you will be going to resolution. You will keep 100% as he fucked up and admitted to it.

    Looks to me like they attempted to deliver the package three times, as expected, but the business was closed the first time, and then the fake name became an issue. That's his problem, Jack. He can go pick it up or take the loss.

    Ditch this fool. Blacklist and advise him to finalize the order he's admitted to fucking  up or move to resolution center and end contact. Admins will no doubt release payment, and perhaps be able to protect your feedback given the circumstances.

    That said, I don't think he's a scammer.  If he is, it's actually somewhat clever.  My official opinion is that he's just stupid beyond comprehension and somehow managed to stay alive long enough to learn how to get onto a hidden service and order drugs.

    No fuck that. This guy is an idiot, and he screwed up. You delivered on your end, it's all up to him. If I had lb's of weed non deliverable bc of a fake name then those vendors would have laughed at me. Don't give up, you will win in resolve.

    I'm very new at all this and don't even have enough purchases to occupy all the digits of one hand, but this guy is very sloppy.
    <br/>
    Apparently, he didn't even read (or pay attention to) your profile nor the item's sale page. Just from the meger purchases I've made, I can almost quote passages from the vendor's profile page. You gotta study that shit, people.
    <br/>
    This is not Amazon. This is not eBay. This is a covert and illicit drug deal you're making, and you can't just leave the other guy hangin'! If he didn't like the terms of the sale, he should have shopped elsewhere. I did that many, many times before I found a couple of vendors that I was totally comfortable with.

    If I were this guy, I'd feel like utter dog-shit for making such a bone-headed mistake, and would be prepared to take my lumps, just hoping the vendor would be as magnanomous as yourself.

     You probably remember my post in the newbies section. I don't have 50 posts to reply to your thread, but here is what I know RE: international express and registered mail policies for the USPS:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     First, we don't play games with Express and Registered Mail. Everyone along the line has to sign for it including the truck drivers that run between offices. All Express scans especially are hawked by the muckity mucks so that they can hammer on anyone that borks it up, or to know who's wages to garnish if that diamond ring grows legs. They can't possibly know if an article just got a mistaken undeliverable scan versus attempted, though. As far as we're concerned, we did what you paid for at that point. Domestic parcels are attempted, and if they can't be delivered (nobody to sign, gate closed, won't fit, etc), a 3849 (pink slip) is left. Sorry we missed you, etc. This is only if the name is right but delivery can not be made, otherwise it immediately gets an undeliverable scan (bad name/address/refused/vacant) and sent back from whence it came. Lots of folks don't know that we have a vacant scan and rubber stamp... Once we scan the article as attempted, our clock stops and we're in no hurry to do anything with that parcel. The carrier leaves a notice, brings it back to the office, and a clerk puts it on the "wall" where we can find it when the customer brings in his slip. For *domestic* originating parcels, we leave a notice on day 1 and a final notice after 5 days, with a date of return 10 days after that on the slip. For *foreign* parcels, we leave notice on day 1, 5 days later a final notice, and a full 30 days later we send it back. Except we most often wait even longer than that because it's just sitting there not hurting anyone and returning that shit is work when we know the customer could show up anytime, usually the day after we bounce it. Also, we know returns probably won't make it anyway since it's all the way to fkn china or whatever, and is probably just some eBay trinket.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Long story short, your boy needs to call the post office and ask if there's a parcel on the shelf waiting. I promise the inspectors aren't camped out for weeks waiting for someone to pick something up at their leisure. You know that but he doesn't.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There are a raft of carrier newbies working the streets these days however. CCAs, or City Carrier Associates. The USPS BLOWS DONKEY DICK at training. The put these newbies making $14/hr with and old timer who may or may not have any tangible social skills for a few days and whatever they pick up during that time is all they know, besides the whirlwind orientation. That and where to bathroom is. SO it's quite possible that it really did get returned by some n00bus dillywhacker on day 1.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sorry if you've covered any of this, I didn't read the whole thread through.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Good luck with your vending, and I always take note of your posts. You're a clever man

     Just read the rest. That stooge just needs to go pick up the damn parcel. THEN he needs to send some bitcoins on over and apologize for existing. We don't check ID if you bring a slip, since if you have access to the slip you must be an authorized box holder. Only vacation hold pickups and restricted delivery certifides require ID AFAIK, as far as picking up mail goes.

    Wow... I just read this whole thread, Are you fucking kidding me, This guy has to be the biggest retard ever. He is literally to blame for every aspect of this things jack. Every single aspect. And wants a re-ship because he is too paranoid to go and pick up his package or get his friend to go pick up his package. Was this his first purchase?
    <br/>
    This is exacty why noobs should read read read and fuckign read more before ordering, Not only that but they should order small, Read some more, then order big, Then keep reading. To whoever said this guy probably walks around selling drugs by doing the old "you looking for any .... mate" and sending texts from his own phone etc is 100% correct. he is an absolute dckhead this guy

    id like a rule(s) like that, like your first [certain amount] of orders should be small or domestic or something like that. Or must have a forum presence for larger orders, of course its obviously up to the individual vendor but it could cut down on honest vendors like jack being scammed, perhaps a topic for a new thread...

    lol, read the first post and thought "he used a fake name ans is too scared to go get it." Tell the guy to grow a pair. All you need is the slip to get the box. They don't ask for ID. There is no reason not to just walk in there, hand them the slip, and walk out with the box/letter. People are too fucking paranoid. Also, if you don't pick it up they attempt redelivery sometimes. If for some reason I have not heard of that the slip isn't good enough just say you forgot your fucking wallet, but here's the slip with my name on it. The post office doesn't give a shit.

    No, no one has ever heard of it because it doesn't happen.  I don't have any experience with that mail service, but I have dealt with several in 3 different countries.  Because the package is tracked, usually if they aren't able to deliver they WILL HOLD the package anyway somewhere you will be able to pick it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I assumed that it would be the standard since it has happened to me several times and have always been able to go pick up the package thanks to the tracking number.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It does make sense after all.  Sending mail back to where it came from is a burden for any mail service.  It's an extra cost, however small it may really be.  Business-wise, instantly shipping tracked mail back, just because it didn't work the first time, is suicide.  Holding undeliverable mail however only becomes a cost once storage room is exhausted and the items can be located thanks to the tracking number.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You know what else is business suicide?  Being generous with idiots.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And it's his own fault if he can't talk his way into getting the package anyway without ID, if he did need it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course if he's a scam artist he's perfectly capable of that.  On the other hand if he's as dumb as he looks he'll probably soil his pants walking to the post office.  Hard to know which one it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS: That's very kind of you and all but, aren't you afraid of attracting more scammers by showing how excessively nice you've been with this guy?  It's not something I would advertise publicly.  I'm not arguing the choice you made of course, it was probably necessary albeit a little too generous!

    You know it's like, you give your little son/nephew/cousin a little cash for his birthday, you know his/her brother/sister WILL be asking for the same.  Greedy little pigs. Oink.

    Don't know why buyers can't understand that a fake name is a red flag,  and a violation of most agreements.
    <br/>
    The buyer probably gets a 1000 pieces of mail in his name,  but very few as Tricky Dick Nixon, Bart "Smoking" Simpson or Slick Willie Clinton.  Most local mailboxes have last names of addresses written in box.  This does not even consider the US mail tracking program that stores info on every piece of mail.  This makes finding the odd addressee for any address very simple.
    <br/>
    Jack, as representative of commoners, I think you have delivered your end of the deal,  and buyer was nuts to play name games.  No one has to use their real names, just don't bother ordering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally don't sign for packages, but you seem to have a proven system, and this was clearly stated.  I'm guessing this was one of the new members.

    Very generous, jack.I just hope this joker doesn't rediscover his balls and go and collect his original parcel from the post depot where it clearly is.
    <br/>
    I guess we've all had to do that at some time. I actually had to do it having lost the slip and the guy behind the desk was like "dude we've got 3000 items back here but if you leave your phone number I'll ring you if it turns up"
    <br/>
    I did so thinking "am I just walking into some kind of trap? But sure enough later that day he rings up and says "hey! I've got your heroin if you want to come and get it?" (He didn't actually say this he referred to it as a letter!)
    <br/>
    So I went and retrieved it. It turned out the vendor had forgot to put stamps on it, so that's why it didn't get delivered. My arse was twitching a bit when I went in, but it felt so sweet to be driving away.
    <br/>
    Its important to remember then post office deal with huge volumes of mail,and unless you are rreceiving serious weight, they are not going to be inspecting it too much.
    <br/>
    This guys package is just sat on a shelf waiting for him to bring the slip in. It is probably more likely to cause him trouble if he doesn't collect it, as it has his name on it!

    It is possible that the customer is lying and he just didn't want to sign for his order therefore the order was sent back to the sender?

    imho this would be a much more acceptable reason for this whole shitspin because if there is no one to sign for the courier shipment they WILL leave a note to pick it up from a postal center or a shipment courier headquarters of some sort.

    Hmm. Somehow I expected to see many succesful transactions when I was going to visit your vendor page.
    <br/>
    At first I was wondering why you were so scared of perhaps a 1/5, although that sucks for all of us 100% legit vendors even with a lot of transactions.
    <br/>
    Perhaps it would be a good idea to start out with shipping smaller amounts. You'd get more orders, perhaps less money, but then this would be less of a problem for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It does not matter if the person is stupid or a scammer. You held up your end of the deal and even gave a tracking number. The customer was in the wrong, not you. And that person might have double the product by now...
    <br/>
    You've been too kind.. while at the same time you kind of had to in order to save your rating.
    <br/>
    When a vendor starts out and asks your amounts of money, I think many buyers would feel anxious to order.. therefore it's better to gain more succesful transactions with smaller amounts...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This reminds me of the only time old virmo shipped with a tracking number. Good thing is that the customer had low stats and old virmo required him to FE. At the right time the customer changed to feedback to: received order, will update later.
    <br/>
    A while later the customer claimed that he did not receive the order, and the tracking site showed that it was delivered, and then that the address was wrong and it was returned to the sender. There was not even a return address on it  :o
    <br/>
    The customer then said that old virmo shipped it to the right name and street but wrong number. Then claimed copy pasting pgp messages was wrong and it should be written manually and that he knew all about it because he was a big vendor with only succesful transactions.
    <br/>
    Then old virmo said he must have been either completely retarded or LE. Then never heard from the guy again, while taking a hit in the rating, but luckily already had the money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You sound like a good guy and I hope you stay this way. There are some big vendors out there that claim to know exactly when their orders arrive, while there is no tracking number used. Then if it does not arrive they offer a reship of about 80% if the customer pays 50% and then they ship nothing again and tell the customers that they must be flagged even though they do receive all other orders...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay true like you seem to be, then you're the man  8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now about this blacklisting thing. This is a vendor only thing now? We don't have access to the vendor forums?
    <br/>
    Some buyers in the EU seriously need to be discussed. People advice against FE'ing, but if we did not then all those buyers with new accounts would not have paid us and simply claimed they did not receive anything, not even letters from customs...
    <br/>
    At the same time it's bad that we give them a better buyer profile by requiring them to FE...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh well.. You felt certain about yourself and did not have the time to check the tracking.
    <br/>
    You did, otherwise you wouldn't have posted so much about it on here ;)
    <br/>
    Next time just check the tracking for your own peace of mind. And know that there are 2,3 slips as mentioned earlier and what happened this time was not your problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck with your business :) You will soon proceed us with your bulk amounts  &gt;:( ;)

    <br/>
    And this.
    <br/>
    My 2 satoshis:
    <br/>
    Business is not about being nice, it's about being fair. There is a nuance. Do you feel like you did your part of the job? Than let it slide. From what you state, there is nothing you could have done to avoid this outcome, you conducted that transaction as per your T&amp;C's. So what? Why do you want to do a reship?
    <br/>
    I don't understand that move business wise.
    <br/>
    He'll be pleased, sure, and you made yourself a lot of new customers who stumbled across this thread, not sure there the kind of guys you want running their errands in your little store though...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A quick question to help us understand:
    <br/>
    - how long has that parcel been sitting in the post office?
    <br/>
    If he used his name as stated, he should be able to pick that up. Where I'm from, you need to show recipients ID no matter what. He still could have someone else pick that up for him, if he's not comfortable doing that himself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Reading your comms, I cannot see whether it was shipped back already, or if it's going to be shipped back.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This part doesn't add up. Your not in resolution, so it's been less than 17days since put in transit (assuming you shipped the same day you changed status). You said it got dispatched too fast, resulting in that issue. 3day int. shipping would be fast, I guess. 2 attempted deliveries makes it 5days. They don't return to sender before, at least 10 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - does he have the slip, or not? It happens here that postal workers are lazy and omit to leave the slip, or they put it in a wrong box, that happens. It happens less with letters than parcels, still. If he doesn't have the slip, he wouldn't be able to pick the parcel up, obviously. I believe you can still send your receipt, using that, he'll get the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll assume you did your part, you shipped on time, the parcel made it through customs in a whim and it was shipped out for delivery to the address that was provided (which is essential, but can't be verified here. I won't elaborate).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This guy clearly didn't do the job on his end. He left a name which wasn't the tenants, now he's scared to shit to pick up the sending, fuck him end of the story. If you want to be nice, help him get the shit. It's easy. In this thread alone there is tons of advice, you could figure a way he'd be comfortable with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A reship? It's over the top, it's undue, hence completely irrational.
    <br/>
    Personally, I witnessed drastic improvements in my life once I learned to say no. Just saying...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace out

    Yeah, it made it faster than you stated Jason.  I didn't say it came too fast, he did.  I'm not stating dates or times in this thread.  I also wont be doing this for anyone again.  I have terms and conditions and I will follow them for now on.

    It is understandable you won't mention dates here. Still, you didn't answer any of my questions. Only one requires dates.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would you PM me whether the parcel left the post office already, I'm looking up all the info I can on how the postal system works?

    <br/>
    - any attempt to recover it whilst it was sitting at the post office?

    This guy is indeed the worse customer you could imagine. Even the feedback he left reminds me of what you sometimes see on vendor profiles from new sellers making up some bogus generic crap. A few more orders from this guy and you'll have someone reporting you to the admins.  ;D
