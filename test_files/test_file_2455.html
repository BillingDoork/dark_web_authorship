    I order tons of stuff off amazon and everything always arrives on time, but when it comes to orders on Silk Road I've failed to receive one Canada order and two NL orders, and have received one domestic and one NL order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live within eyesight of the freaking mail hub in the downtown area of one of the biggest cities in the damn country. I don't get love letters, I order from reputable vendors and my orders just simply fucking vanish. I know the best thing to do is just lay low cuz I'm probably on some list or some shit, but my Canadian order was supposed to be DISCRETE AS FUCK and it's been over 3 weeks with no luck. Anyone have any indicator of what the hell is going on here?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For clarification, I'm talking about a quarter sheet of LSD and 20 defqons who the fuck knows where and it's got my name on it.

    By chance... is your mail man a drug user? If so, you're probably just getting your orders stolen and taken home. If you don't get letters or set up for jail, it's a thief. Do you live alone?

    There is absolutely no way the mail man is taking only the mail with drugs in them, I live in an apartment so he just comes in every day and sorts out mail for ~60 people at once.

    <br/>
    Schizofreen's original package never arrived, and his reshipment is on day 10, which is still pretty recent, but people have been getting their orders in 3, 4, 7 and 8 days which leaves me to be incredibly concerned. He isn't selectively scamming me because the reshipment was purely to uphold his customer loyalty (and I didn't even pay for it).

    Agreed.  It's hard to say.   Alot of people here don't get a letter, and never recieve their order from the NL.  It's like the order vanishes.  NL is so tempting to order from, but it sketches me out.   Hope they come through for ya...

    Any person with the slightest bit of common sense will wonder "why is it that so many pieces of mail come from &lt;insert country of residence&gt; but every few weeks one from the netherlands shows up?", even more so if the packaging was less than ideal and the mailman simply was able to smell something odd.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And there goes your drugs. Unless OP is ordering domestically, which it doesn't seem like it. I know this may seemed far fetched, but it's a hell of a lot more likely than 3 of your packages "magically" disappearing into thin air.

    I'm in the same position  &gt;:(
    <br/>
    Looks like its going from 4 -5 now in the past 2 weeks. Four small orders UK to UK (2 MDMA, NBOMe, LSD) and 1 from Poland, yet have had 2 nice airmail deliveries of Durban Poison last week and today so can't figure that one out!

    I think you are over looking other very possible outcomes:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A- They could have been retained by those countries customs and you can be certain they wont be conducting and international case for your so little order. Customs don't go letter 1 by 1, they just have dogs analyze random piles of letter mail inside big bags, so even if your address is flagged, they may never even notice you ordering again with same address and name.
    <br/>
    B- If the post office detects it, most likely the employee is not gonna call LE for your very little order or even add your name and address to this big black list (is a pain to do as employee), they just dash it to the "illegals room" to be destroyed and think "better luck next time pall".
    <br/>
    C- Last thing I said may also be happening in your country customs.
    <br/>
    D- Some sort of combination of this points.
    <br/>
    E- Vendor screwing with you.
