    Could anyone tell me what is involved with opening a PO Box in the UK? Where do you go to open it, and where exactly would the PO Box be? Cheers!!Â  :)

    Hi Garrincha, first things first, if you live in a big city in UK, then I'm pretty sure you would have a PO Box. However another term for these is probably called mail redirection service. You don't need to say where you live here but instead try a google search, mail redirection service 'city name'. Cities known for having a large student population will for sure have these services.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now when it comes to opening it can be one of three from what I know, there are companies that allow you to register with no I.D whatsoever, the most they will ask you for own personal address this is for them redirect the mail to you, some you can open it online simply by sending a scan of a I.D and utility bill, and some you need to go in person and do all of the above, ideally you don't want a big company, you want something less popular, less organized as they care more for your cash rather then your credentials.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helps, anymore info you can PM me.
