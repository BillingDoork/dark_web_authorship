    Does anyone here use ups as a po box supplier? If so how has it been for you so far? Do you have any tips for anyone else?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been using my box for a couple of weeks now for first class mail. It's worked pretty well. The only thing I'm curious about is actual packages. The boxes aren't very big. I'm sure something small like a half oz to an oz of bud would fit but what if the package is bigger? Is it like at the post office where you just take a slip to the desk? I just wanted to see if anyone else has gone through this and can give some reassurance to me before I make a decent order.

    DEA Targets FedEx, UPS in Online Pharmacy Battle
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "We have no interest in violating the privacy of our customers by opening and inspecting their packages in an attempt to determine the legality of the contents," says FedEx spokesperson
    <br/>
    By Phillip Smith on March 30, 2013
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SAN FRANCISCO, CA — Charged with cracking down on the diversion of prescription drugs, the DEA has pursed doctors, pharmacists, pharmacy chains, and wholesale drug suppliers. It has now turned a baleful eye on shipping companies as well, with differing results—at least so far.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Orlando Sentinel reported Tuesday that both UPS and FedEx had admitted in corporate filings that they were the targets of DEA probes into packages of pills shipped from online pharmacies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Prescriptions filled by online pharmacies are illegal if there is not a real doctor-patient relationship, and the DEA maintains that prescriptions written by “cyber doctors” relying on online questionnaires are not legal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FedEx has strongly pushed back against the DEA probe, but UPS has now buckled under the pressure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In a Friday statement, the DEA announced that UPS had agreed to forfeit $40 million it had been paid for shipments by online pharmacies and to enter into a “compliance program” to ensure online pharmacies can’t use its services. The deal was part of a non-prosecution agreement the shipper signed with federal prosecutors in Northern California.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DEA accused UPS of knowingly shipping the illegally-prescribed drugs between 2003 and 2010 because “it was on notice, through some employees” that such activities were occurring. DEA also accused UPS of failing to do anything about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “DEA is aggressively targeting the diversion of controlled substances, as well as those who facilitate their unlawful distribution,” said DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart.  “This investigation is significant and DEA applauds UPS for working to strengthen and enhance its practices in order to prevent future drug diversion.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FedEx may prove a tougher nut to crack. Officials there called the federal probe “absurd and disturbing” and said it threatened customer privacy. They also accused the DEA of failing to cooperate with them in efforts to resolve the problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “We are a transportation company — we are not law enforcement, we are not doctors and we are not pharmacists,” FedEx spokesman Patrick Fitzgerald said in a prepared statement. “We have no interest in violating the privacy of our customers by opening and inspecting their packages in an attempt to determine the legality of the contents. We stand ready and willing to support and assist law enforcement. We cannot, however, do their jobs for them.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FedEx complained that rather than working with the shipping industry to come up with solutions, the Justice Department appeared focused on finding ways to prosecute shippers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “This is unwarranted by law and a dangerous distraction at a time when the purported illegal activity by these pharmacies continues,” Fitzgerald said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FedEx has been a major campaign contributor to US Rep. John Mica (R-FL), whom the Sentinel reported had sent a letter to Leonhart and Attorney General Eric Holder asking them to recognize “the difficulty and unfairness of requiring those carriers to assume responsibility for the legality and validity of the contents of the millions of sealed packages that they pick up and deliver ever day.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mica told the Sentinel that while he is “concerned about prescription drugs,” it was inefficient to try to turn shipping companies into drug policy enforcers. “You can’t stop commerce; you can’t open every package,” Mica said. “I’m only asking them for a reasonable approach.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But it doesn’t appear that DEA and the Justice Department are interested in that.

    There's nothing wrong with using a ups box, namuld's post relates more towards using ups as a courier which is a completely different question. If the package is too big they'll hold it for you for like four days or so I think, just ask them the next time you're there.

    We do not ship to PO Box's as we've had buyers say, "well, many people have the PO BOX key, etc.." and have not seen a package so...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just our policy, as I'm sure many other sellers are willing to do business drop shipping to POB's

    Shipping to a UPS box does not involve shipping to a "PO Box" type address. The actual physical address of the store is the address you send the package to. UPS then determines which box is the customers. This way overnight packages from USPS can be sent to a UPS box. I'm sure Crazy has shipped to a UPS box many times and not even known it.

    Regardless, USPS requires a warrant to open packages and ups, fedex, etc don't require it.

    what information do they require to sign up for ups box?

    <br/>
    *2 forums of ID, one including a photo.

    1) So a drivers license would do it.

    I've had a UPS box for the last few years. It's signed up in my name, they'll have you sign a form that has your actual address on it with proof of address such as a drivers license or such. I've had literally well over 500+ packages delivered over the course of the years, and only begun to use SR within the last couple months. So far I'm 25/25 on orders from SR (mostly domestic and a few international), and I even get an e-mail letting me know when a package was delivered with the tracking number. I never have to sign for anything until I come into the store to pick up my mail and packages, and that's just to acknowledge they've handed the packages over to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a lot better for stealth anyway as you package is simply sitting there. You don't have to sign on delivery, and there's no way in hell LE is going to wait out days or weeks for a specific person when tens of customers come in a day (unless you're on the Feds radar, in which case you're fucked anyway). You can let it sit for a week or more before picking it up, and UPS Stores are usually well trafficked locations, so anonymity works well. You can also have packages delivered in the name of a business and not use your personal name for added security.

    While I don't use UPS but another similar "Private Mailbox Company" which is franchised, I do it for the same reasons as you. The employees are not nosey at all, and I feel there is some level of plausible deniability considering YOU never sign for a package. The employee signs for any package addressed to your box, so I figured you can deny you ever ordered anything and that the company you pay just accepted it per usual. Anyone can send anyone something in the mail right? The main perk like you mentioned is I can let it sit for however long I want. If the cops are staking out this building for the two weeks I might let it sit then they already have a case on me to want to devout the man-power.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One last thing, my company doesn't require me to sign for a package when I pick it up, even to have records that I received it. Technically I never signed/accepted a package on any paper, and I paid a deposit for AFTERHOURS keys so I can come in after closing or even at 3AM to pick something up if I wanted.
