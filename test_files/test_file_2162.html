    i hope someone answers this with detail! please!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i want to receive goodies from sr that are only shipped within usa.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so lets say i have a friend in usa, that i want to simply reship a package that arrives to him from sr. what i don't want is for him to open it up or anything. which he won't.
    <br/>
    how does he send the package overseas?
    <br/>
    can he simply take the envelope he receives from sr, and send that same envelope to an international destination?
    <br/>
    or does he have to get a new envelope and PUT the sr INSIDE that new envelope?
    <br/>
    what i'm hoping i can do is simply go to usps / ups / fedex and create a label for that package.. email it to him, so he can print it out, and then he would paste that label on the same envelope, right?
    <br/>
    but to do that all those sites require a weight of the package and a description for customs.
    <br/>
    without actually seeing the package or being able to weigh it, does that mean HE has to weigh it?
    <br/>
    what would the appropriate description for customs be? "gifts" or "documents"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    then does he have to go to a post office or can he use those blue public mail boxes and just slip the envelope inside one of those?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what i'm looking for is for someone to please post a step by step tutorial for someone like myself that needs the mail forwarding to international.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    btw, this would only be for tiny amounts like 1g or less that fit into flat envelopes.

    Can you be more clear?  From what I read, I'm guessing your not in the U.S.?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So you want to place an order from an American vendor and send it to your friends house that is also in the states.  Than you want your friend to not open it up if possible and send the package to you which is overseas?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Depending on the package like whether it is a letter sized envelope or a package with a delivery confirmation number, there will be little lines and numbers made by machines that process/sort mail.  Or if it is a bigger envelope or box with a delivery confirmation number, there will be a sticker on the package with the confirmation number on it.  Point being, postal workers will know that it is an evenlope/package that was already used.  Your friend is going to re-package it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way, what is the point of this?  Why order from the U.S. only?

    exactly. i will be traveling overseas for quite a few months. i'm planning ahead.
    <br/>
    the reason is according to the forum and reviews there are 2 or 3 vendors that offer the best QUALITY for my fav goodie. (meth) and according to their listing they only ship to usa.
    <br/>
    when you say repackage does that mean he can put that envelope (without opening) into another envelope that will go overseas?
    <br/>
    what about making the label, with weight and customs description, or where to ship from? (post office or blue box)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    can't my friend simply remove the sticker or label and put a new label on it? without opening it, etc?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thank u for ur replies and time

    Instead of trying to clean up an existing envelope (which would include taking off any stamps, markings, affixing new labels over the existing addresses and is generally a pain in the ass) why not just give him a flat-rate envelope (Express or Priority depending on how time-sensitive this is for you) and have him deposit the vendor-package into it and send it off?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Priority: https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail-international-flat.htm
    <br/>
    Express: https://www.usps.com/ship/express-mail-international-flat.htm
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's no need to calculate weight with these envelopes. Just get the envelope, stick the label on it and give it to your friend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S. I'm not in the U.S. and it took me 30 sec to find this information despite never once having used USPS. I don't understand what the problem is really - or am I missing something here?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: to answer some more of your questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First of all, you don't need to use a customs form if you're mailing certain documents. However, to be exempt you have to meet certain restrictions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://pe.usps.gov/text/imm/immc1_008.htm#ep1026163 go to "Priority Mail International Flat Rate Envelopes (Maximum weight limit: 4 pounds)"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As you can see, it says:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All Priority Mail International Flat Rate Envelopes containing only documents except for the known mailer exemption described in the entry below.
    <br/>
    -Under 16 ounces, no more than 3/4 inch thick, and uniformly thick
    <br/>
    -Required PS form: None
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next, dropping in the blue boxes: I'm honestly not sure. I think that Priority can go into the boxes but not Express? Like I said, I'm not American and I'm too lazy to scour usps.com more than necessary - I'm sure someone who knows more about this will be able to help you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally, a question - it sounds like you live in the US but you'll be overseas, right? So why don't you just order the stuff you need, repackage it, stick it in an envelope with a label and postage and give it to your friend and say "please drop this off at the box/post-office on this date" instead of having your friend do the packaging?

    Since you are not dealing drugs and sending packages will be minimal.  You're friend can simply put that envelope in to a new one with new labels and stamps and drop it off in a blue box.  I would not use express mail for delivering drugs overseas.  It may get there faster but there is also a bigger chance it will be inspected more thoroughly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your other questions can be answered on the USPS website like mentioned.  I'm not too sure about the weighing but if it is an international package you will probably have to go to the post office if you want a delivery confirmation.  And if you are going to spend big money on expensive drugs, might as well invest on a cheap food scale so your friend can weight it if need be.

    ok, getting a clearer picture. i appreciate your input, friend.
    <br/>
    so you're saying just have him weigh the envelope.. then pop that envelope into another one and put the label on it, yea?
    <br/>
    i don't understand .. he would have to go to post office or just drop in box? you mentioned both. obviously would prefer the box for anonymity :)

    Alright, I just checked - you can stick Priority flat-rate envelopes into the mailbox unless they weigh over 13oz. I'm not sure about Express envelopes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still, you should double-checked everything I've said - just call USPS and ask them if you can put Priority/Express flat-rate envelopes into the mailbox and they'll tell you for sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As long as you're using a flat-rate envelope you don't need to weight it, the variances in weight are included in the price hence the "flat rate" in the name. Source: https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail-flat.htm (as long as it's under &lt;70lb and fits in the envelope).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if I were you I'd get a Priority *flat-rate* envelope, put a label on it and give it to your friend. Then they can put whatever inside, seal it and drop it into a mailbox. Obviously make sure to check that whatever packaging your vendor uses will fit inside the flat-rate envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No customs form necessary as long as it's less than 3/4" thick, under 16oz and has no bulges.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously though dude, you could have done all this research yourself. I don't mind helping, but I could very well be wrong. You're shipping drugs internationally, are you sure you want to take the word of someone who's never even seen a USPS blue box?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go to usps.com and look it up yourself. Hell, I even gave you all the links.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, that's my "caveat emptor" warning. Good luck with shit.
