    If I just want to ship some "stuff"  ;D and get a DCN number for my package, will I need my ID or can I just put down some bogus information?  Like do they ask me for my ID or anything?  I need to ship some stuff but I haven't figured out how to get around this DCN issue without providing my personal information and I'd just like to avoid this.  Appreciate any feedback!

    Thanks,

    Agree with everything Northwest Nugget said. Remember also there are cameras in most PO's.

    It's best to ship from the next town over than fro your local it provides several loopholes that allow you to be a simple mail runner for a business and solve your return address issues.
    <br/>
    I suggest never using fake address', it doesnt have to be your address but it does neet to be real to not look suspicious.

    Thanks all.  So, can someone suggest or PM me on how to even begin researching ways to be able to track my packages without having to get into the post office each time, besides bribing a postal working for tracking stickers?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers,

    go on usps.com and look up Self-Service Kiosks in your area. Just BEWARE of the camera pointed at your face whenyou use it, I cover it the entire time when using.
    <br/>
    With that kiosk ou can select the type of box, flat rate etc. then put in the zipcode of the addressee, then use a gift card visa, buy at Walgreens or something.
    <br/>
    You can purchase up to 8 as credit, then it won't take that visa without a pin number. So I always have two cards available.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Put the label onto your box, then your printed label from home with the destination address, and have a return label as well. I print everything out and take it with me to PO, all boxes are have the zipcode on them so I know which box goes to who.
    <br/>
    THats it. done. and everyone has made it to the destination. BUT now I use the click n ship, PM if you want to know.

    The vision of the camera must be block but still allow in light, or else the black image will cause an error "sorry I can not process payment now" do not throw away the label backing save it for next time as it works well to block the vision of the camera.  I read some de-classified document about the kiosk the camera section are blacked out. Inquiring to post office manager is returned with a statement that camera is to stop fraud.
