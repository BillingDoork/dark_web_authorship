    Im thinking about buying a fair amount (personal amount) of k from the uk to the us, but ive never bought non domestically so its really hard to gather how much of a risk im taking just by browsing the forums here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is the average like 1 in 10 that it doesn't arrive? 5 in 10? .0001 in 10?Â  ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it got stopped I guess i would just ignore any contact from postal service and LE because they would have no way to prove that the package was really for me and that I knew about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My other question would be that If it got stopped and i took the loss on it would it be too risky to still order things domestically?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks a lot in advance

    I am in exactly the opposite position, living in Europe, ordering from the US (things I can't get here or that are ways cheaper in the US), and I also am a fan of K.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know how much difference there is between US and EU customs, but my experience in the EU has always been positive (for things like 10g of K, that easily fit into a standard envelope without drawing attention. I have also twice orderd weed, 2x1oz from different vendors iirc, even those I received without problems, even customs accepted all of those without claim for import duties, which I almost always get when buying completely legit items on ebay from private sellers, no idea how the vendors do this, at least for packages that clearly do not contain paper alone, like the two weed orders).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still I am very wary of ordering bulkier things from outside the EU, but for 10g of any powder I wouldn't worry, if it's one of the major vendors and offers shipping to the EU openly.
    <br/>
    I wouldn't buy from a new vendor, or one with few transaction, or one that generally does only ship to the US but is willing to make an exception for you (ok, I have done this for the two weed packages, successfully, but I still wouldn't recommend it).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    May I ask which K you are considering? (PM if you don't want to tell openly).
    <br/>
    I do believe that I have sampled most of the major EU vendor's K.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe we could swap samples? I am really interested in some offers from US vendors, but haven't tried them yet (the K i currently can get inside the EU for good prices is more than good enough for me, but still I'd like to try Ivory's or some other vendor's in the US or Canada)
