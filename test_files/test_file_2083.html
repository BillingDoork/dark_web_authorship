    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would like to start selling some pseudo-ephedrine tablets (and other ones) but I was wondering if they need to be vacuum packed?
    <br/>
    They are still in their original 'medical packaging' (strong plastic casing with push trough metal foil on the back).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is because I currently don't have a vacuum machine lying around here.
    <br/>
    And I'm shipping from Europe to World Wide btw.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kind Regards,
    <br/>

    You mean blister packs, yes?  The problem shipping these are the unavoidable  and unmistakable rattling noise they make.  The way to eliminate that is by poking a tiny needle size hole in each compartment followed by vac sealing.  The vac removes the air and forces the pills tight against the seal.

    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, it are blister packs and thanks for the advice;).
    <br/>
    But the problem is this: Do these pills have to be vacuum sealed?
    <br/>
    Because I don't have a vacuum sealer yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking it's not necessary because dogs can't smell the ephedrine.
    <br/>
    I maybe can get the pills out of the blister package and just seal them in a zip bag and then in a bubble envelope.
    <br/>
    Or is this against SR standards?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kind Regards

    Lots of people prefer to receive pills in blisters because it is some measure of authenticity. Did you advertise them as such?  If not, you are much better off shipping them out of the blisters.  If you do ship them intact you want to deal with the rattling issue  as its impossible to hide that.  Here in the states if I didn't want to buy vac sealer but needed it for a one time use...I can go to most any retailer who carries them..make the purchase and then return it within 30 days for full refund.   If you plan on doing more selling its a worthwhile investment and not that pricey.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    btw, if you ship without blisters and don't get a vac sealer I suggest you lay all the pills out flat on  table..then lay masking tape across them  ..flip and do same to other side so that the pills are sandwiched between 2 layers of tape.  Place your pill sandwich in between 2 pieces of heavy stock card and tape up.  This will prevent them from moving or being crushed during shipping. It also mks the pkg seem like it's only documents or photos.  You don't want to ship a pkg that is irregular or bunched up

    As a buyer who's received quite a few pill orders (mostly amphetamines), I can tell you that only once was vacuum sealing used. It's not something I expect, nor would I rate you poorly if you didn't vacuum seal, nor have I seen others rate poorly for it. Now weed, that's a completely different story!

    Thanks for the photos.  Very great way to ship pills.  But one question, was this just an example for photos, or do you normally not wear gloves?  Fingerprints can be found, especially when using tape.  Tape will preserve fingerprints perfectly.  Or am I just being paranoid?

    I would prefer to use gloves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But another question. In these thread we talk about Pseudo-Ephedrine. What about Benzodiazepines and eventually other kind of medicines ? Is there a risk with dogs which could it smell? Should we use odor-blocking bags and vacuum seals?
