    So, like always, when I feel an order is overdo, my mind starts to wander, paranoia makes an appearance, and its always over nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got to check the drop again. Still nothing. When I get back home I get a call. Drop reciever tells the following:Â  A family member of the drop got a call from an acquaintance. She got home with her mail and had a package, with a surname she recognized. She called the drops relative and personally delivered the POUND OF WEED to the drops relative, who then brought it to the drop. The post office put the key in the wrong damn box. BY CHANCE the receiver was a good Samaritan, and knew the family. In a small community this could have went very bad for the drop!

    So remember kids, moisture barrier bags and hidden cutouts in layers of cardboard are only going to get you so far when the government has a policy of hiring incompetent ant workers.
