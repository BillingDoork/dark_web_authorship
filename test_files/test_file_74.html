    There is a new TV series that started this Monday on RTE1 called customs..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I learned from it is that all the post for the country comes in through Dublin Airport, obviously courier countries would be different.
    <br/>
    Then everything is sent off to four distribution centers - the dogs are used here primarily if I recall correctly. This program began recording about two years ago and the guy with the dog (featured in Portlaoise said that sometimes you can could catch 2 or 3 things in 1 one day and then you might not find anything at all for a few days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've noticed here that a major vendor moved his postal operations from the Netherlands to Germany and I assume this is because so many postal systems have that country red flagged. However, and this was very interesting....Germany has very good relations with Irish customs, more so than most other countries (if any at all) and they have often worked together and tip each other off. The program did not mention if the German customs have these kind of relationships with other countries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Something I find strange here among many vendors who are running serious operations is they don't have the power or influence to bribe the postal system. I mean surely if Osama bin Laden was able to train people to fly planes at such a professional level then drug dealers could do something - maybe I'm just expecting organized crime to be more advanced than it is. When I use the Airline pilot simile I am also referring to making people employable by the postal systems. (whatever training you would need for that job)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, it may be the case that the front line larger suppliers will now move away somewhat from crime on the streets as we know it. It's gonna be a lot more geek behind the computer screen stuff like you see in James Bond films so maybe the postal system will be a great focus in these new times.

    Shows like this are notorious for over dramatizing border security and for their use as a scare tactic/deterrent. They are also edited to remove any mistakes or failures on the part of LEO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other "high risk" countries have similar shows - take "Homeland Security USA" and "Border Security: Australia's Front Line" as examples.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That isn't to say you should let down your guard, though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On a side note, TOR is the perfect place for organized criminal activity - while larger crime syndicates may flourish (and I'd be surprised if they didn't already know or utilize the deep web), street-level gangs with nationwide or even international followings (MS13, crips, bloods, etc.) will most likely remain street-level.

    Yeah the customs here can work when they want to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2 weeks ago they perfomed a series of raids on a few local addresses near me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A guy was basically caught with 4Kg total of 4MEC i think it was, in a few different packages to different addresses??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However i have been told that this was siezed because one of the smaller packages was notcied and then they follwed it to get the others. Playing connect the dots no doubt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He was getting it shipped from china via a resender or some service in germany i believe

    Bribing of postal workers doesn't really apply to the type of business of most vendors on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bribery only really becomes economically feasible with large occasional importaions, its possible to bribe customs clearance through a few different channels but it would be nigh on impossible to do it for thousands of different packages.

    well wouldn't you know it, had my first seizure today. from a vendor who used to be based in NL but ships from GER now. the packaging from this vendor has always been top notch, couldnt ask for better, so i just cant see how the dogs would have got it, so maybe it was flagged by german customs? what i find curious is that it takes four working days for orders to arrive from germany, yet i received this letter today after only two working days, which would mean it landed in ireland after one working day???. something is up.

    Anyone seen the prgrams 'passport patrol' and 'nothing to declare'. There great! Dont know which one it is but i think there australians customs and they show how they check the packages, theres the usal dogs running along a conveyor belt of letters/packages to get a scent. and i mean literaly running over so 1st rule your packaging is gonna get trample on so make it strong lol. and they go through xray machines to look for odd things. normaly the ones they flag up are dark patches showing up which is normaly organic matter. they have a tool they jus rub on the package and put in a machine and it can dtect a host of illegal substances. they also look in the packages.
    <br/>
    some are really well hidden like in gas bottles e.t.c. they general find something if they decide to open up the package and some of the stealth they get through is quite complex. sometimes they basicla just use a drill until ago through they get through they wont be able to chack them all so still a very slim chance yours is caught as obviuolsy the program will exagerate there strictness but one they got suspicions about a package, they will find it! I heard australia is quite a problem country so i dont know if this is an example of all customs.
    <br/>
    oh and another thing flagged up is daft names e.t.c

    Thing is, I've never ordered 8grams of weed, the order was 2 grams and a joint, so i figured they weighed the joint. But then the package i was expecting, arrives today, which was the earliest I was expecting it anyway, i just assumed it was that package they had as it was the only order of weed i had ordered.

    From the beginning i was a bit miffed how they could have gotten the package so soon.

    So where has this 8 GRAMS order of weed come from?

    Anyone know the likeliness of my address being flagged?
