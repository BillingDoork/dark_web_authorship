    Ordered some coke from The Netherlands to USA.  Checked the USPS website and it is in the ISC sorting facility in NY.  Has been for 6 days.  I know they process all international mail there and have customs there.  Any clue what the odds of 3.5g of coke being caught there is?

    If it's packaged well, It should be OK. Please keep us updated I'm curious to see how it works out. 6 days does seem like a while to be stuck in Customs.

    USPS closures have meant gradually slower processing times. Your item will show in customs until it starts moving through the USPS system, it doesnt necessarily mean they are looking at it any longer than normal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am seeing alot of missed scans lately as well .. packs going ISC to the final destination sort center a few times. Only gonna get worse I would imagine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldnt worry too much yet.

    Good point and it's only going to get worst. If you look at it they are basically on the verge of Bankruptcy.

    Thanks for the advice.  They received the package in NY Customs on the 1st of June, which is a Friday.  Not sure if they move product on the weekend or not.  It is only a ball of coke, but I am not sure if I should clean house, or if they seize it they wont even bother with me.

    If they find it, They most likely will seize it. Send you the customary Love Letter.

    My guess is that it isn't coming.
    <br/>
    Especially if it's a domestic package. 25 days is quite a while.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Order -
    <br/>
    If large, clean.
    <br/>
    If small, wouldn't worry as much.

    If it's international hold out for 30 days, If nothing comes then it's probably lost or seized.

    On a similar note my product for NE to US has been in transit for 5 days. I'm probably jumping the gun, but my packages always come fast. Would local law scout you out and such? The tension makes every LEO seem like they know what's up lol. Would they skip a love letter and come screw you over?

    I wouldn't think so. Because the Love Letter comes from U.S. Customs they are Federal, The Police are local 2 different branches of law enforcement and we all know how much they hate working together. A small order for personal use is most likely too small to devote federal resources for an investigation.
