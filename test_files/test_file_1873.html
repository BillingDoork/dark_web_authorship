    I want to buy 2g of hash from one of SR's sellers.  This will be the first time I buy something off SR, and even though I haven't ordered the hash yet, I already freak out about it.  I just moved into a new apartment, do you think it's safe if the first letter I receive at my new address contains hash?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I being too paranoid?  Should I really be worried for ordering 2g of hash?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I read the forums frequently since one month, I've read a lot about PGP and stuff and I understood how to use it.  I am just a bit scared, which I think is usual for a first order.  Any good advices to be sure everything goes well with my order, things I should not forget to do?

    Order some benzos as your first order. That way you have a way to calm yourself on future order anxiety.  ;D

    I don't know what the laws are like in your area, but all I can say is ordering a personal amount your first time will definitely minimise any risk of an arrest. You're more likely to have your package confiscated than any follow up investigation. Do your research for your local area though. And if the worst should happen have a plan in place. Read up on how people suggest you deal with LE to get more detail, but the general practice is to say nothing to them until you have spoken to a lawyer.

    If you're truly paranoid, once you receive your package, don't open it. Write "return to sender" on it, and leave it on your counter. If nobody is knocking on your door that night and you make it to the next morning, you're fine.

    You'll be fine, mate.
    <br/>
    U.K., made about 10 orders, arrived every time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pr0 tips:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Research your vendor a bit and use your intuition (i.e. do I trust this guy with my address), check the forums too reviews arent everything
    <br/>
    2. If you're running Tor on your main OS, stop now - make a live Liberte CD and use Eraser to scrub any traces of Tor off your pc or anything to do with TSR.
    <br/>
    3. Use a tumbling service like BitFog and make sure you use PGP.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We've all been there mate, it gets easier with each and every transaction. Good luck.

    I personally hate booting from a live install. I use a virtual machine session that's protected behind TrueCrypt to get into Ubuntu. And then I have within that another TrueCrypt drive that stores my Tor browser.
