    Looks like they're back at it. Just checked my shipping and it departed a USPS sorting facility today (Dec25 Christmas). ;D

    It was accepted in City 1, California on Dec24 around 12PM. It was processed in City 2, California on Dec24 around 10PM. It departed City 2, California on Dec25. It didn't say what time, but it updated sometime from 12pm-2pm. I can only assume it's gunna reach my state in a few hours and be in the post office tomorrow morning based on the last tracking from the same vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I won't disclose the state it's going to, but it's on the other coast.

    Ok thanks, I was originally thinking international but they seem to be back on schedule anyways based on your times. Hopefully customs &amp; the international sorting centers can speed things up now too.

    I must be really lucky, I got a package on the 21st that went from west to east coast in 2 days, and none of my other orders have been delayed this month. I know it helps to be near a major city/sorting facility(which I am) but I couldn't believe that my last order wasn't delayed even 1 day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the downside though, I'm sure this means the likelihood of packages being seized is a bit higher now because of the decrease in volume of mail going through the system. I'm not TOO concerned though, because the amount of stuff in each of my individual orders would be unarguably considered to be personal use quantities.

    Yeah dude I hear you. A west coast order (priority) was dropped off at like 5PM, arrived in my state about nine hours later. West to east coast. Fast as fuck. This order seems to be a little bit slower even though its coming from the same spot, but I think it's just the tracking not updating.

    Weird. It must be the USPS routes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Give it some time, I think the latest they deliver is by 5pm. My mailman came when it was absolutely SHITTY out, so weather usually isn't a problem. Some days, rarely, my mailman never comes, must be him calling out sick or something and forgetting to have someone fill his spot.

    IMM SOO PISSED AT THIS POINT!! iv been waiting on a Order from somewhere in EU for over 14 fucking days and its yet to come.. Which its been taken 1st class shipping here in the US a whole fucking week so i guess i cant expect much better coming from another country even though its suppose to be priority .. Unless the vendor is just FOS which i doubt cause he seems like a god guy with over 300 sales and 100 rating so i guess its the snail mail.. Iv been told its useuall for this time of year , but xtremly slow for this vendor/

    Maybe you didn't get any mail. Did you watch the mailbox the whole day? If the mailman doesn't stop at your box, he can drive by in less than a minute and you'd miss him.

    I just checked a priority tracking number and it hasn't shown any movement from where it began since monday so i guess some are slow and some are working faster, doesn't suprise me postal workers don't give a shit about productivity at some locations so its hit and miss i bet depending on route and what type of manager runs a USPS place

    I got regular mail but i know packages are backed up in my area because my bro lives one state away and we still haven't gotten the christmas presents he sent let alone a couple of orders i got in transit from here. One vendor was nice enought to express an order to me today so i could have it tomorrow since it looks like priority and first class are a crap shoot right now.  Oh well the waiting game is in full swing this time of year!:(
