    I just spent a half hour at the post office bullshitting my way into convincing them to hand me ten books of 100 labels. Clearly I hit the jackpot today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The woman kept telling me over and over again that in order for the tracking labels to work, I would need to bring them into the office with the packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I disagreed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can someone who has used them answer this question? If I drop off my packages, with the labels on them in blue usps mail box's, will they be scanned by the person who picks them up from the box and tracked? Or will they not be tracked at all because they weren't scanned at a post office?

    I have had some that are scanned from departing the box, and some that don't get scanned until the sorting facility. Either way, I have yet to come across one that never gets scanned.
