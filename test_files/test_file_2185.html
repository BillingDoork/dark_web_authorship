    I know this is an old post, but seriously dude, your question is ridiculous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take a step back and consider it: you're asking us about the identification requirements a mom &amp; pop shop in an unknown location, *in an unknown country*! How do you expect anyone to be able to offer you good advice? "Oh, yeah, the mom &amp; pop PO box shop on Nakamoto St in Osaka? The one run by the crazy Japanese couple with the black, gay adopted son? They only want your National ID card and a utility bill. You're welcome!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have you considered CALLING THEM AND ASKING? Or walking over and asking? Anything except asking a bunch of strangers on an anonymous forum who have _absolutely no way_ to give you the correct answer?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sorry to rag on you, but you've managed to find SR, to set up Tor, buy bitcoins and maybe even PGP and this is the step of the process that puzzles you?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As to the latter part of your query, look in the "forgeries" section, find someone who carries ID from your country/province/oblast/state/region and read the feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally, have you considered the full consequences of renting a box with fake ID? If you get busted it now won't be for ordering a gram of weed, but for ordering a gram of weed + a felony for the fake ID.

    There are much better alternatives to PO Boxes, and I've mentioned what they are hundreds of times on this forum.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously, just search my posts on the subject, I have no idea why people are so enamored with PO boxes.

    The reason people are so enamored of PO boxes is because they consider them to offer a semblance of security through very little effort. Whether or not this illusory security actually exists is up for debate, but it does to the person and what's what prompts such decisions.

    If it is a UPS store, they WILL need two forms of identification.  A picture ID(LICENSE) and a Credit card. They will scan them and keep it in their files.

    I have considered getting a PO box, but even the mom and pop locations have security cameras, which could easily be used to identify someone.  I think there are better ways than using PO boxes, like shipping to a friend's home, that also avoid the PO box fees for an added bonus.

    I don't understand why people would send their shit to a friends or relatives house.  That is just so disrespectful and you call your self a friend?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I may be a bit biased because a 'BEST FRIEND" basically snitched one me and I got all the trouble for a little bit of fucking weed.  Basically ruined my reputation in all aspects including 10+grand for lawyer, probation, and fingerprint expunge fees.
