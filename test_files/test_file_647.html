    I go to a large state university with ~20,000 undergrads and thousands of international students.  I am not really worried about the risk of receiving here, but will vendors have problems shipping to a university PO box?

    Probably not. Some vendor's won't ship to a po box but there shouldn't be any complications other than that.

    Yeah I would assume most vendors would have no problem shipping to a university, but make sure you do your homework and choose a vendor known for there stealth just to be safe.

    No, but you will have problems with getting kicked out of school.
    <br/>
    Id recommend opening a PO box somewhere in town.
    <br/>
    your education is not worth a bag of drugs.

    Excellent point. You can easily lose your dorm privileges or even get expelled just for smoking in your room. And don't forget about student employees. There is always a chance of someone working the mail room stealing it.

    Shouldn't the same process that makes shipping to your home address protect you?
    <br/>
    If confronted, "didn't order this, didn't expect it, maybe someone is trying to kick me out"
    <br/>
    it's perfectly reasonable for a student to go pick up their packages, take them to their room, and open them (without checking where they're from, even - textbooks, schools supplies, things from relatives...)  - orchestrating a sting, if a university would do that,( having somehow figured out, without obviously opening your package, that you had drugs) - would be very difficult.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What you do with them can get you kicked out, but that's the case no matter how you acquire them.

    Haha, when I was in halls we smoked weed with the security guard in our rooms, I guess there are some advantages to being in Blighty!
