    Hey folks.  I'm wondering if ANYONE on SR has received a loveletter in the past couple months.
    <br/>
    I've not been seeing any reports of late, and we used to get a few each week.  I'm wondering if they've stopped issuing them, as many folks use them to determine if their address has been flagged or not.
    <br/>
    I don't need details of dates, etc.  Just a yes or no.

    I believe that they do still send out love letters in certain cases. However, the individual agent that finds the package has the authority too use discretion in determining when too issue a love letter.

    Lol - I interpreted that as the customs guys taking gear home to use themselves. Struck me as very funny, the wording.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe one of them has got a bad monkey and hence seizers but no LL to go with it :D Maybe they should just get the squad hooked and then their seizure rate would go thru the roof :)(:
