    checked tracking and status states "could not be delivered as addressed". so i went to the post office and they said its because the name wasnt on the mailbox (my gfs name is no longer there, i had no knowledge of this). so this is true. is she safe to go pick it up. the post office gave us 2 numberss to call about seeing if they still have it to redeliver it?

    Another incoherent ramble that makes no sense.

    <br/>
    Once mail is determined to be "Undeliverable as Addressed" it gets RTS(Return to Sender)  Furthermore, mail that get's tagged undeliverable will get sent back to that zone's Sort Facility for further processing. ..NOT to a local Post Office.  Your story is full of holes.

    Sorry for being so unclear. U pretty much answered what I was trying to figure out. Now the question is what can I do about this. The whole reason for all the delay is because the name it was shipped to isnt on the mailbox. *I was not aware of this.

    Careful with your details, your OP is fine but always remember not to give away too many details.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did you address the order correctly, for example, you didn't anything that would raise a flag in your address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i.e.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "in care of"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always best to use the name of the person who lives at the place where you are sending stuff.
    <br/>
    The post office knows where everyone lives.

    stay out of it ,have your gf go after it...remember there are a lot of fish in the sea JK (sort of) nah but i used to get weight shipped to me and the address was fucked at least 3 times and I had to go pick it up from fdx and sign. there was a cop in the lot once. i said to myself "what would an innocent man do?" so i parked right next to the cop car went in there signed for 7 lbs of weed and gave him a head nod on the way out. they dont try and bust you at the facilities.

    my 2 cents
