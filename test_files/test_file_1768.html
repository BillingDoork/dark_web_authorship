    So I'll try to keep this short, I think I might have dodged a CD because I was away on the weekend and was expecting a non-registered letter to arrive this week, meaning No signature required. Turns out the mailman left a card saying i need to pick it up since I was not home, and it was ticked under "ordinary mail", and below it, "registered mail" isn't ticked off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to know what you guys think, could it be a CD? I'm asking my vendor again to make sure he sent it as unregistered. Another problem I have is that I used a pseudonym. The card I received says I need to bring my ID card or Passport at the back print... This is frustrating and I've got 2 weeks to consider claiming it. But I can't do so if the names barely match and I could just be walking into their trap... Fuck..

    And before you go on a rant about me being an idiot using a fake name, was because I used it when I first ordered, and had to stick to it or it would be more dodgy.. my fault there

    In your specific case ,don't pick it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You said you can't anyways due to the false name being used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if your vendor confirmed it was not registered mail and confirms the letter was not the size of an infant dinossaur and fits most mailboxes then there is no reason for the postman to take the letter with him instead of dropping it in your box.

    Hahah I really appreciate that isobetadine, the vendor is going to check to confirm if it was sent as registered or non, but the thing is, its not a narcotic, its actually modafinil and I don't think its illegal in my country... Even if it turns out to be sent by registered, I can't prove its my letter with a different name on my identity card, what if I say i'm picking it up for a friend, technically they can't use the signature to allow a search warrant, can they?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It just annoys me since there were some mishaps that caused it to come late, and was eager and now i know its sitting in that post office but I probably can't get it..

    Better than going to jail/court.
