    I try out new vendor products from time to time and noticed something that surprised me from one of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After picking up my product from a safe friends location I stopped for something to eat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While I was sitting there at Xburger's parking lot I jumped on my laptop/free WiFi and for some reason I did a search on the vendors return address on my package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't ask me why, it had never occurred to me before to do so but for some reason I did it, bored I suppose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What did I find you ask?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was shipped from a drug state and the street view of the address was of a local medical dispensary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fuck all I thought to myself, I'm glad I didn't have this one shipped home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well I guess I won't be using that drop location again, call me extra paranoid, and now I'm wondering if this happens often.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does this scare the shit out of anyone else and should we be checking the return addresses of vendors?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sending a message to the vendor to let him know my concern and I'm not going giving out names so don't ask.

    Whether or not the package actually came from that particular location, it's probably some protection on everyone's part. Yes, it's a real location, as addresses on mail should be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, let's say for instance there wasn't enough postage on the package, and the buyer doesn't want to sign for it or whatever they have to do to claim it, because it obviously could have been searched or set up as a trap. If you don't claim it, it's sent back to the sender/vendor. If that address isn't real, that's when things get hairy. Having that dispensary raises fewer questions about the package. The USPS doesn't know what's in it - just where it came from and where it's going.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As long as all that adds up and there's no reason to suspect anything out of the ordinary, it stands to reason they'll deliver it just fine, making whatever assumptions and judgements they want as they might about hundreds of other packages being sent from and to that same dispensary, identical to yours.
