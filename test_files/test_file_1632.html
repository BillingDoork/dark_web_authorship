    6 days including weekend for one and 7 days including for another that came in around the same time. Any UK vendor that sends letters 1st class mail should be able to get this speed.

    That said I sent mail from the UK to aus a couple of years back and it took i think 35 days or something like that

    I have got a letter coming from Budworx as well...It was shipped on Friday apparently. I went on his shop today and I noticed he removed all his listings saying they are going on a break for a month or 2 o_O So if it doesnt come im in for a long wait for a refund! He claims 100% Aussie orders made it through since the 16th of July with his new stealth method...1 guy from oz said he never got his package...That was left a day or 2 ago... Fuckin hop I get mine man...GL

    To follow up to questions before, im waiting on 4 packages to two different drops. 3 from tried and trusted UK vendors, and 1 from a new guy who seems legit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would normally think that one or more have been seized because there taking so long.. but is unusual for none of them to come through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess i kinda fucked myself over with a newb mistake by getting too exited and ordering too much at a time. Now i might never know what slipped everything else up!

    If they are small orders (i.e. 8 ball or less) it probably won't make much difference if one gets pinging in transit, if it was bulk that might change things. Address flagging does happen but not often and generally only when you are under investigation.

    Fuck it I try not to flame people but you clearly know fuck all about AU customs, you do realize they are x-raying entire pallets of letter mail these days looking for organic matter now yeah? so your 1g of coke in an MBB can be seen on the scanner image.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only the other day you were calling another vendor a scammer then your order turned up so why don't you just cool it until you get your facts straight for a change.

    They are x-raying a lot yes, not everything but a lot more than they ever used too which is why shipping times are all over the place and seizure rates are up significantly. I know people whose success rates have plummeted in the last 4 months, these are buyers with over $100k spent and a 0% refund rate I might add so they know what they are doing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for what you can do to counter it well I'm still considering that myself but just making something non permeable with MBB is no longer enough, I am just hoping they run out of money soon as they cannot keep this up indefinitely, they are also due for a funding cut which ironically might be the driving force behind their extra efforts so they can go "hey look at all these drugs in the mail, if you cut our funding the sky will fall in".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am sure there are some experts in spectroscopy who could advise on methods to beat the scanners, it is however not a subject I am qualified to offer an opinion on.

    its possible there are just some delays at the moment, can't be sure things won't come through in a week or so, its not unheard of of letters being delayed. I haven't seen many people in feedback on a couple of bigger sellers reporting arrival into aus for a recent period. usually i can tell arrival based on the reports of other people getting when they got shipped out same day

     They are x-raying a lot yes, not everything but a lot more than they ever used too which is why shipping times are all over the place and seizure rates are up significantly. I know people whose success rates have plummeted in the last 4 months, these are buyers with over $100k spent and a 0% refund rate I might add so they know what they are doing.

     As for what you can do to counter it well I'm still considering that myself but just making something non permeable with MBB is no longer enough, I am just hoping they run out of money soon as they cannot keep this up indefinitely, they are also due for a funding cut which ironically might be the driving force behind their extra efforts so they can go "hey look at all these drugs in the mail, if you cut our funding the sky will fall in".

    It is good to be worried when importing illegal substances across international boarders, a healthy dose of paranoia is severely missing from many people who have recently bumbled their way into SR (I'm not referring to you by the way shazmo009, I'm just making an observation). I just hope you are using safe drop arrangements i.e. not ordering to your home address or an address easily linked to you.

    I have one order coming to my home address :/ which was an entirely noobish mistake. Im only a month into the road with a few orders under my belt but when I decided to order abroad I got overly excited and rushed into it without doing the proper research about international orders. Its only for a g of speed though. After that I came to my senses and organized a couple of very nice drop points which have no link to me whatsoever  :D I just hope the original order to my home makes it through so my home does not come under scrutiny in any way, shape or form from LE. Live and learn I guess...

    I think some people must just order a lot more than others/ re-selling. I am at 90% over more than 2 years, but don't order internationally that frequently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In more recent times I am at 90% on multiple *hash* orders over 5gms. I haven't noticed any change in success rates and I am sceptical of any information regarding customs activities that *doesn't* come from a crooked or loose lipped customs officer as the official information is pure propaganda, and everything else is speculation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IME UK orders are 7 - 14 days, and are rarely a problem if you use a good seller. I do agree that sticking to the smaller, more customer focused vendors is the way to go.

    I don't really endorse the use of speculation as fact.  Is anyone here working in customs that can verify ANYTHING? Is anyone doing anything more than using anecdotal evidence from a couple of mates to ascertain what customs may or may not be doing?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the past 8 weeks I've had all but one UK order arrive, and the one that didn't I can only really chalk up to a selective scam because magically everything else going to that drop from the UK turned up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's all I can know for sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't be so quick to chalk up a no-show to out Super Beagle Ninja™ customs.  They're no different to any other customs.

    I agree. No one here knows for sure whats the deal with our customs, the most part of it is pure speculation. I can say that in the past 6 months i have had nothing but good luck with certain vendors from the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its just now im going on 15 days (total including weekends) and none of my 4 orders have turned up to any drops i start to worry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did however have another package turn up that i placed after all these other orders, but it wasnt a substance of any illicit type. Completely legal product.

    I guess this is what happens when your waiting on late packages, most of the time you assume the worst.  :(

    The information I posted regarding the scanning of larger quantities of letter mail came from a slightly more credible source that just "a few mates" but I accept that it is not necessarily cast iron proof of what customs may or may not be doing, I just have it on very good authority they are implementing these practices more frequently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My personal success rate has dropped this year and the UK continues to be a challenging country for me to order from, I have no idea why my experiences ordering from there differs so much than many others but I am well aware I am far from alone in seeing a very notable increase in the number of no shows across the board over the past 4 months.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it might also be worth noting that this aspect of the discussion in this thread was sparked by claims a no show was proof of selective scamming, something I challenged as a no show proves nothing and could very well be a customs seizure even if the person I was responding too claimed customs could never find a 1g order in a letter unless it was packaged very poorly. Having lost multiple small orders from vendors I know to have shipped I know for a fact customs can and do detect small quantities in letter mail regularly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway this argument will continue until the cows come home, was being bounced around the forums 11 months ago when I joined and is showing no sign of letting up because in the absence of a clear context people will invariably create their own.

    Will customs always send a letter if they seize these products? As I understand it they won't be able to test for specific RCs without getting a GCMS test which costs a lot of money. Are they legally obliged to send a seizure notice to someone in this context?

    There is definitely no guarantee you will get a seizure notice, in fact I've never seen one and have lost countless orders. Mine were not RCs, it may be more likely with RCs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my experience it's definitely possible for them to seize your order even if its non-sniffable. As Samesame has mentioned, its very likely they are using other methods (such as x-ray) as well at the moment. I've lost an order recently from a vendor who has exceptional packaging and I'm confident he didn't let the smell permeate.

    It's interesting what SSBD says about the customs and scanning a lot more letters. I'm hoping he is wrong but I have been lurking on here enough (without the posts) to know that he isn't a bullshitter. As he says though this increase in surveillance must cost a fortune and the money must run out at some point, especially when you consider drugs in the mail would account for about 0.5% (at absolute max) of all drug transactions in Australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is one theory on it though - We all know our government (all of them are) is corrupt to the core... Is it possible there is under the table funding coming from drug syndicates towards authorities to try and smash the "drugs in mail" trade (most of which would be silk road)... Australians finally have access to high quality European priced drugs and that is something these guys would want to stop that from spreading across the Australian drug landscape. Whilst a good contact could get you good quality in the past, there has been a lot of bunk floating around and even a good contact was bound to get some low quality for time to time, and since i've been in the scene (04/05 onwards) the cost has always been very high. Or is that even to conspiracy theorist for SR?
