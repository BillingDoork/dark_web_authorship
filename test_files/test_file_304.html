    it shows at customs over the weekend 4+ days ago it says(prosessed though sort facility, but never inbound to customs, but that on arrival). but at the same time. i do not know about registered letters but with other tracking it will say inbound this has said processed through sorting at customs and that was 6 days ago and it hasnt said any different! I mean with other tracking it always says inbound into customs does registered letters not say this?
    <br/>
    let me know what you all think or more so from experience!
    <br/>
    thank you!!i am worried! i dont like checking ever 3 or 4 days and it still says same shit! ha so if anyone else ordered registered letter/parcel! please let me know if anything similar happened!

    Registered letters can be and usually are VERY SLOW.  This is because registered mail must be signed for at every single step. When it changes hands (custody) at ANY point, it must be accounted for and signed off on by the new custodian. Such as from you to the post office, postal worker #1 -&gt; postal worker #2, the post office to the airport package loaders, from the airport mail handler -&gt; customs agent #1, from customs back to the destination country post office sort center, from the sorting center to the next sorting center, from there to the delivery truck driver... every one of those hand offs has to be signed for. So it can take forever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I once had a registered mail piece come from Europe to the USA. What normally takes 6 days via standard air mail took more than 2 months via Registered Mail. But it was not opened by anyone. It just took a long, long time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes stuff coming into the country will say inbound into customs and outbound from customs, but sometimes it will not say that. I'm not sure what determines if it says so or not, however I'm pretty sure all mail of every sort goes through customs.

    snappy tom.
    <br/>
    Thanks for the info. I did  A LOT OF research on this last night and from what i read domestic registered is the one under lock and key that they have to sign for every step of the way.
    <br/>
    and from what i read everyone has it say processed into sort facility at customs and then after that nothing until its delivered. I have not seen 1 out of 40 people say it says ibound and out bound. I read on a site where postal employees give feedback to people and they said that because registered mail does not have a deadline on it. As EMS. Express, PRiority..... at customs it goes to the bottom of the barrel and is the last ones they process. So it made me feel much much better! here i will post links!
    <br/>
    the first one is answered by postal employees which of course i did not ask them:)

    just try to have patience, the situation you describe is fairly common
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think its very common to spend at least 4-5 days in customs even if express. recently i have been seeing a week or two for orders from asia. one report was even nearly 3 weeks before it arrived - and that wasnt updated from the time it arrived at ISC until after the delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think processed through is the same thing basically as saying its either in or passed customs so you should be fine, just give it some more time and i am sure it will show up
    <br/>
    <br/>
    whether or not it gets updated doesnt seem to be clearly following a pattern. i dont know why but i think somehow packages get passed certain stages without being scanned properly. for example sometimes it will show as moving along after customs but often it wont show any movement and then just is delivered.
