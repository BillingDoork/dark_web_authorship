    Has anyone had any experience shipping, or receiving, packages at a US military base?  Specifically, bases not located in the continental U.S.  Would most vendors have a problem with shipping to an APO/FPO address?

    Can't say I've had request from such addresses. Are there young soldiers these days that would take such a risk to their enlistment? Just seems crazy to me to even consider it. Even if I did not feel that packages to FPO/APO address are quite likely to receive extreme scrutiny at some point in the shipping process, I would not feel comfortable enabling a military person to put themselves at such extreme risks...  Anyone know the military punishments for getting caught with illicit substances while enlisted are?

    Assuming that the recipient is a member of the armed forces,an expected and reasonable conclusion to this situation would be non-judicial punishment (NJP) and subsequent discharge under other than honorable conditions. I would ask of vendors to simply not entertain the idea of shipping to FPO/APO and for any member of the armed forces to simply complete their obligation prior to indulging in extracurriculars. This has less to do with free will and more to with a specific clause to your enlistment where you are contractually bound to not use illicit substances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In other words, you agreed to not doing drugs so keep your word. Any discharge with other than honorable conditions will do damage from which it will take years to recover. I'm speaking from experience many years ago and would be happy to discuss further.

    Carry on.

    keep in mind it doesnt necessarily have to be somebody in the military ordering.  It could be one of their dependents

    I say send it, but do a really good job stealth packaging it. Some advice: use the persons last name on the return address so it looks like a care package from family. Put the drugs inside an item so if the package is opened the drugs will be hidden and not in plain site. Send some candy bars or cookies along with the product to make it seem like a care package. Imagine what you would want if you were in that situation and send that along with the goods; candy, underware, socks, personal hygiene items, etc.

    Everyone deserves to take part in this wonderful place we know as the Silkroad, especially our fighting forces.
