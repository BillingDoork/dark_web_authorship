    Well, I've lurked on the forum for a while and never really had a need to post. I joined Silk Road in the fall.
    <br/>
    So I  am located in Canada. I have ordered some edibles from the US and decided to order some weed for the summer.
    <br/>
    So I ordered a half oz of weed from another Canadian vendor with good feedback, no tracking number for the order. It was shipped Monday, June 25th. Me and the Vendor are both located on the east coast of Canada so I was thinking it should have arrived by now.
    <br/>
    I don't really think it was my post man that stole it, but it's hard to tell.
    <br/>
    Plus, Canada Post was really slow over the weekend due to Canada Day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what do you think happened to my package? Mail man or just Canada Post being slow?

    I have been here for 4 months with 30 transactions and I can tell you from experience: it's Canada Post dude. They are the most useless unhelpful organization on the face of the Earth. I have been unable to track packages (despite the fact that they were sent with tracking number's), waited up to a month for packages from the U.S. (that were sent the first week), and most recently their system stated that an express item was "delivered" to my address when it was not (of course, I had no recourse...b/c I hadn't signed anything!!). Oh yeah: they also seem to employ thieves who seem to have an uncanny sense for detecting and stealing packages with drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a fellow Canuck I strongly recommend that you request all future orders to be sent as REGISTERED MAIL: meaning that all future deliveries are confirmed by your signature. The Domestic Charge is $1.50 and for American purchases it's an additional $10. bucks... which for me is well worth the peace of mind.This will ensure that you either get the package or have recourse for replacement/refund if you don't and won't have to get all paranoid about imagined LE interception.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I imagine that many of our American SR users might be horrified by my advice to sign for a package containing illegal drugs... and if I were an American I certainly wouldn't sign for any 'iffy' package either... but remember: Canada does not have the same aggressive 'War on Drugs' infrastructure (DEA/Dept.Homeland Sec/U.S Customs) or harsh penalties that the U.S. has...... (yet).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good-luck dude. Welcome to Silk Road.

    Yeah they wont deliver in my area if it snows. Rural Route.
    <br/>
    They managed to send one of my orders back to the UK after it was in my towns post office due to lack of postage. Then have it delivered a month late after the vendor re-shiped "facepalm"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good to hear that I'm not the only one they fuck around with.
    <br/>
    I have had them leave a $600 dollar order (legal) on my doorstep in the rain.(Nothing ruined)  It was insured and required a signature. When I checked the tracking I looked at the scanned sig, the post man put in "N/A"
    <br/>
    Ugh, time will tell.

    Update:
    <br/>
    Today, 17 days after the item "shipped" still nothing, opened in resolve with a 30 day extension, vendor offered to reship with tracking paid by me. I was more than willing.
    <br/>
    7 days ago vendor said he would re ship the next day, I have sent multiple messages asking if it had shipped and how much I had to pay for shipping. 4 messages before I got a simple reply of "I will let you know" (4 days ago) Now I'm just waiting no news from vendor and nothing in the mail.
    <br/>
    I don't want to harass the vendor with messages but this was a half oz of weed, not spare change.

    Who was the vendor?  It's important to know so that other can make informed decisions on vendors/buyers.

    Yea wow I hope it's just the mail service cause it's sucks getting scammed. I've been scammed before and it becomes a realization when the person your buying from suddenly stops communication. I hope it's not the case in your situation but if it is please report the bastard.

    Yea, Still no reply from the vendor. Sent a message to SR Support today.  The vendor seemed so willing to re-ship and then nothing no explanation or replies.  F
    <br/>
    So if SR ends up refunding me, will it wreck my buyer stats.

    Update:
    <br/>
    So about a week after I sent a message to SR Support the vendor messages me asking if I have received anything in the mail. (I believe that he was asking about the original shipment.) He continued to say that if I had not received anything, he would reship and give me 2g of hash for the trouble. Vendor asked for address and I posted it in the resolution center.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agreed and offered to pay for Canada Post Express-post  (domestic)
    <br/>
    5 days later he asked if I received anything I haven't received anything yet.
    <br/>
    10 days later I ask if he has shipped anything or not and I'm told it was shipped and that the vendor was sure it would arrive this week, With a nice bonus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I truly believe that the vendor was not trying to scam me. If I get the reship with the bonus I will be satisfied with the outcome and will consider ordering again ( over 60 days since I ordered but better late than never)

    fucking canada post! they tore a hole in a big shipment of mine and removed the goods, never knocked on the door just left a delivery notice. Then fedex surgically removed the goods from another package and delivered the empty box. These were double sealed and alcohol wiped. Crafty bastards!!! ups has been the best for me.

    Well, hopefully I don't receive any love letters, just bud. :P
    <br/>
    Resolution case expires in 9 days then SR Staff step in, so I guess I'll see if anything shows up this week then let the staff make their decision.
