    ive been around for a while and i review a lot of new vendors products, mostly because i know what im talking about and give fair honest reviews, i try to give back to the community by welcoming new vendors with some tips that they might not find elsewhere (which i wont post for a number of personal reasons)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However to give back to the community as a whole here is a list of Red flag indicators that get packages sniffed by dogs and xray-ed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * No return address
    <br/>
    * Restrictive markings (such as writing "Personal!" on the envelope)
    <br/>
    * Misspelled words
    <br/>
    * Poorly typed or written text
    <br/>
    * Excessive postage
    <br/>
    * Addressed to an incorrect title
    <br/>
    * Sent from a foreign country
    <br/>
    * Sealed with tape
    <br/>
    * Emits a strange odor (Including masking agents such as coffee, perfume and fabric softener sheets)
    <br/>
    * Lopsided, uneven, rigid, bulky or otherwise uneven weight distribution
    <br/>
    * Oily stains, discolorations and crystallization's on packaging
    <br/>
    * Packaging appears to be re-used
    <br/>
    * Package looks generally poorly prepared for shipping
    <br/>
    * addresses are hand written
    <br/>
    * addresses contain misspelled information (such as names, streets or cities)
    <br/>
    * Originate from a drug source state
    <br/>
    * Are addressed as being sent from an individual to an individual
    <br/>
    * Return address ZIP code does not match ZIP code of the post office the package is being sent from
    <br/>
    * A fictitious return address is used
    <br/>
    * List a sender or receiver name of a common type (Such as John Smith)
    <br/>
    * Make use of names that are not connected to either address
    <br/>
    * Package makes noise when shaken
    <br/>
    * Redistribution of weight is felt when package is moved or tilted
    <br/>
    <br/>
    keep these in mind when your designing your packaging, and a healthy dose of paranoia you will keep yourself and (more importantly) your customers safe.Â  8)
