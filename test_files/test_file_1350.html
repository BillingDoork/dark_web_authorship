    I'm assuming I'm not the only one worried about LSD being sent in the Summer &amp; being left too long in their hot mailbox. I'm just wondering what (if anything) others have done to combat this. I've been expecting a delivery, so what I've been doing until about an hour &amp; a half before the mail usually gets here is covering the outside of the mailbox in aluminum foil to reflect heat &amp; putting bags of ice+cups of rice in there.  Overkill? Yeah, probably. But I'll be damned if any stupid weather is coming between me &amp; my tabs  8)

    Honestly, I think it's a MUCH smaller problem than people make it out to be.  I got tabs from 3Jane in the dead of summer last year that I can't believe were degraded in the slightest.  Many other respected members on here have also mentioned this.  There was an article about a 50 some odd year old vial not kept in any special environment (amber glass, though, yes) that had practically zero degradation.  I've kept tabs in places I shouldn't have for a year+ and never had a problem.  Left them in a car baking in 100 degree weather for most of a days once and was kicking myself up and down for being so stupid... until I ate some more and realized they were unharmed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you think lining the box with foil isn't going to cause unwanted attention, go for it.  Hell, shove some dry ice in there at that point.  It never hurts to be cautious.  But in this case, I think your caution has a higher probability of raising suspicion (probably not a lot, but I don't think the mail carriers run into foil lined boxes very often) than improving/preventing the decaying quality of the tabs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone has a different opinion, please chime in.  I'm just going off what I've experienced.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whatever happens, have fun with the tabs when they do show up!

    Who did you order from?  What tabs?  How can you be sure they weren't weak/bunk to begin with?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've received severely under dosed (like 1/5 advertised) from very reputable sources in the dead of winter.  This, coupled with my many years of experience handling blotter and knowledge of the difficulty in laying acid accurately leads me to believe that many (definitely not all) of the anecdotes of heat degradation are exaggerated/psychosomatic/attributed to the wrong cause.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you could elaborate a bit maybe you can teach me the error of my ways and help me prevent decreased dosing.  I generally follow the storage rules we all know, but when I've significant mistakes, I can't say I've ever noticed a difference.

    Haha, I'm sure it would definitely bring some attention if I left it on too long &amp; the mail got here while it was still wrapped. I actually only had to do it for one day, they got here this afternoon.

    Oh, I'm not doing this because I've got tabs that were weak before. This was just the first time for me ordering when the weather was so hot. Wanted to take extra precautions the blotters would have a safe home until I retrieved them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as preventing getting weak acid, the only thing I can really suggest is doing your research on the vendor. I've never had an order from SR that was underdosed to the point of being obvious. Of course, I could've got a blotter that was only 103 ug &amp; advertised as 110 ug, but never anything to the point where it was a noticeable difference.

    I've never heard of UV radiation/heat degrading any NBOMES, but then again, I've not done as much research on those as I have LSD. Just because they have a comparable effect, doesn't mean the molecule itself will behave the same way when exposed to certain elements. However, I'm fairly certain they would be just fine. I'm sure I would have ran across at least one mention of heat affecting them if it did significantly.

    I've never had a problem in over a decade of experience receiving LSD in the post, even during the summer.  No one really has ever since the days of the hippie.  It only becomes a problem when vendors use it as an excuse to move bunk product...

    only a prolonged exposure to heat would cause it to degrade its potency but I have seen L survive in some of the warmest weather conditions by just being stored in a book,so yea stuck in a mail box for a few days should not have any immediate effect,unless the sun decides to stick its head in the mailbox (;

    No actual studies, but anecdotally NBOMe doesn't degrade from heat or takes a long time to do so.
