    What I want to ask, is how  do you make up a USPS label with delivery confirmation and NOT have to process it at the local post office. I want to be able to put my own labels on it with delivery confirmation and put my own postage on it myself and just drop it off in a mailbox or something and not have to bring it to the local post office. How is that done? Of course it is a flat fee postage. Thanks.

    No way! If you make a label using USPS, that information is saved and cannot be deleted. So you'll have the buyers address SAVED in an online account on USPS.com's website. Not a good thing to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm looking for a way to purchase postage somehow with delivery confirmation online without it saving it. If you use online, it is $1.00 less then if you went to the post office. I would of course love to use online, but will NOT use a system that saves addresses.

     You put the address on the flat rate box/envelope.  You stick a DCN sticker on it.  You put the appropriate postage on it using stamps.  You drop it off.

     Right now, DCN costs $0.75 extra.  Rates are about to change on Jan 23 or close to that.  Rates will be higher, but tracking will be included for free so it is actually slightly cheaper than it costs now with DCN.

     Right now, the flat rate envelope costs $5.15 and then you need $0.75 on top of that for DCN.  The small flat rate box is $5.35+$0.75 I think.

    You are spot on with your info. I had to add DCN for 0,75 today on a couple of packages. What I would love to do is buy postage online and just print it out. If I walk up to a USPS center and use the machine to buy priority postage flat fee those bastards don't give you the option to include a DCN or not. Then you are still forced to walk up to the window and pay extra for the DCN, unless you buy 0.75 worth of stamps. Then you could just throw it in the outgoing. Right now if you buy postage online they force you to put an address on it. Don't wanna do that. They do include the DCN and is only $4.90 for everything if you buy/print online but for safety reason and the rules, you can't save an address.

    With the walk up machines you just have to print a stamp for whatever postage you want . . .  like $6.10 for the priority with dcn fee included . . . done deal!

    Yes, makes sense. I will do that instead of dealing with anyone at the counter. I just need to buy stamps. I had no idea they sold stamps in those different price ranges. Cool!

     If you buy online, then they'll potentially have it connected with your IP address and credit card.  The savings is nice but not worth it if you want to remain anonymous.  Just buy old fashioned stamps.  They've got $5.15 stamps (being phased out), $5 stamps, $1 stamps, $0.65 stamps, $0.85 stamps, $0.10 stamps, etc for purchase.  You can apply multiple stamps to the package.  Just make sure it equals at leave the value that is needed.

    Couldn't you just use tor to go on USPS.com and use a prepaid card? Not ruling the stamp idea out, but it seems like if you could safely use the website it'd look more professional

       You are spot on with your info. I had to add DCN for 0,75 today on a couple of packages. What I would love to do is buy postage online and just print it out. If I walk up to a USPS center and use the machine to buy priority postage flat fee those bastards don't give you the option to include a DCN or not. Then you are still forced to walk up to the window and pay extra for the DCN, unless you buy 0.75 worth of stamps. Then you could just throw it in the outgoing. Right now if you buy postage online they force you to put an address on it. Don't wanna do that. They do include the DCN and is only $4.90 for everything if you buy/print online but for safety reason and the rules, you can't save an address.

      If you buy online, then they'll potentially have it connected with your IP address and credit card.  The savings is nice but not worth it if you want to remain anonymous.  Just buy old fashioned stamps.  They've got $5.15 stamps (being phased out), $5 stamps, $1 stamps, $0.65 stamps, $0.85 stamps, $0.10 stamps, etc for purchase.  You can apply multiple stamps to the package.  Just make sure it equals at leave the value that is needed.

     Couldn't you just use tor to go on USPS.com and use a prepaid card? Not ruling the stamp idea out, but it seems like if you could safely use the website it'd look more professional

    I agree using Tor to buy with prepaid is bad because it probably increases the likelihood of that package being marked as suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just to clarify this is your recommendation....?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Step 1 - Go to postage kiosk and buy regular stamps using credit card (since they dont accept cash)
    <br/>
    Step 2 - Obtain DCNs from post office - where are these?  Just by the flat rate boxes?
    <br/>
    Step 3 - Affix DCN and enough stamps to account for flat rate plus DCN
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does that sound right?

     The vending machines print stamps with a unique code on them that can be traced back to the credit card that you used to pay as well as the time and location that you made the purchase.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just go to the counter and buy old fashioned stamps.  Just tell them, "I need stamps to ship this flat rate box/envelope with delivery confirmation" and they'll know how much.  If they try and give you a printed stamp tell them you like the old fashioned kind instead.

    Thanks.  I read that the first time but I was thinking that was relating to the DCN - not the stamps.

    In this case it doesnt seem like buying them from the kiosk is good in any event because even if they don't know who bought them they know the time and can get you on camera.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So let's try this again....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Step 1)  Buy stamps from counter at post office using cash.
    <br/>
    Step 2)  Pick up DCN stickers on the way out of the post office - Can anyone clarify where these are kept?

    Step 3)  Pick up flate rate boxes at post office also
    <br/>
    Step 4) Affix stamps and DCN tag to flate rate box, drop in blue box anonymously.

    Why flat rate only? If it's close, use variable rate. Order them. And why pray tell use only priority? First class parcel mail is sometimes just as fast, ocassionally even faster, and cheaper.
