    Hey mates,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is a link to youtube to a Danish crime show called Station 2, they interview a customer and the danish customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The "customer" is a guy really close to me, he tells how Silkroad works, and shows how to order stuff - nice advertising! :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The customs agents talk about they seize around 10 to 50 letters and parcels each week. And the biggest they had seized was 5kilos of ketamine disguised as instant food. They also tell that they screen the mail with a dog, but as I can see it looks very random... They also tell that they x-ray the mail, to see if there are pills inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have ordered to Denmark many times, and never had a problem. But someone I know have had ketamine from india seized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S Sorry for not having subtitles on the video :/

    And as I can see, they are not very harsh on the courrier shipments, they don't even open the transport cages!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My friend told me that the journalist who did make the interview, that they were only around 2 people screening all the mail, so the percentage actually screened is really low.

    Hi k1aKing,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    welcome :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I must concede your post got me perplex.
    <br/>
    At first, you didn't post the link. I'll leave that up to your decision to eventually to link it up once you read my thoughts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me try to sum it up:
    <br/>
    - There is a youtube chanel about crime (or is it on Tv? What is station 2, the Chanel or the name of the tv show?), making a chapter about Silkroad. This seems quite hype those days, indeed.
    <br/>
    - This episode depicts a good friend of yours buying drugs on Silkroad. Is his face blurred? Does he buy domestic or import?
    <br/>
    - You, on your side do import from abroad, as in from  another country, to Denmark regularly, as you said, without any custom seizures or further problems or complications, so far.
    <br/>
    - It also shows the work of two custom officers going through the incoming (international, as in import?) mail.
    <br/>
    - These couple of inspectors seize 10-50 letters and parcels a week, though not being able to open up the incoming trolley, probably due to yet high workload. What they find, can be considered marginal in regard of the incoming volume. Do you agree?
    <br/>
    - Despite that heavy workload, customs still managed to confiscate from someone you know personally, an incoming international ketamine order? Did he get a custom letter or an invitation to the station? I assume it was a small order, not the 5 kg you mention?
    <br/>
    - they are depicted using the tools most commonly mentioned to do so, K-9 (I assume one dog?) and x-ray, but again, not to an effective extend considering the volume yet mentioned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - You consider this as being "good advertising" for the Road, and your absolutely right. Amazing how many drugs get through. How clueless in regard of seized volume and swamped  those poor custom inspectors are.
    <br/>
    - Import of contraband is winning against regulation authorities on danish tv or youtube.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Amazing. Usually it's always the cops winning on tv, taking down some low level street dealers or rowdies. And I liked it that way. You know why?
    <br/>
    Because in that setup the only ones knowing they don't win at all are the cops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the setup you depict, it is pretty much obvious to every viewer, the cops don't win shit. And as I don't believe a worldwide, or global, or even Danish drug legalization will take place anytime soon, I'd prefer the majority stays clueless vs requests adequate means.
    <br/>
    'Cos if they did, then, you, and your friend, and the other one who got pinched with keta, would go down for the camera, just as the street dealers previously.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My 2 cents. Now you post that link of yours if you feel like it. Just be sure to add a clearnet warning.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers Jason

    Are you capable of subtitling or transcribing this for us at all?  It'd be a bit of a task, but I'm really interested.
