    So here is my question..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a friend in Australia who i want to send some narcotics too. I am in Germany. Would it be a good idea to go over to Switzerland and send it from there? as i don't believe its a 'flagged' country. Or maybe Denmark on the other hand?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if anyone has had experience with crossing the borders from germany (ie Germany to Switzerland etc) with narcotics, is there random searches of vehicles? dogs ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ANY COMMENTS WELCOME!!

    I'm guessing anything not from USA (and possibly China, India and Canada) is gonna be flagged to a certain extent. How much post do you think Australia gets from Switzerland every week? Probably like 3 letters rofl

    UK or Ireland would be best imo seeing as how there is a large percentage of Brits/Irish in Australia so most likely more letters/packages coming from these countries
