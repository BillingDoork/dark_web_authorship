    I was just wonder what that mean and why they put those stickers on a Parcel? I got one from same person only express last week and it never had that sticker. It didnt look like it had been gone through or anything , it was great packing and from a friend so true care went into it. The DVD with the 22 20mg OC's  was wrapped like a present along with a couple home baked cupcakes nothing illegal with those..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I was just wondering if the Orange sticker was Meaning My address ID was recorded or Her ID was recorded? Anybody know about this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv had to many packages come in since DEC iv gotta let it die down after  i get my remainder of my Parcels. Good thing is though iv been doing ebay and Listia for years so getting packs is nothing new.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shed some light guys? It came in through the West Coast Customs, well it did the first time they were sent.   THNX GUYS

    It could have been put there by the vendor to make the package appear more legit as it passes by the eyes of various customs creeps. Might not want to say too much about it really - could be part of their stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's definitely not referring to you or any "address ID" (there's no such thing btw).

    International items shipped from Australia often have that sticker on, I assumed it showed they'd been sent through a post office counter rather than dropped in a mailbox.

    I received a package from there which had this sticker that contained stuff for my pets, from what I hear it is quite common.

    Yea its been found out for sure its a AUS thing when they send Internationally..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was not from a vendor but it was a bunch of original OC's...  so no vendor just a friend.. I thought at first they recorded my my ID.but nope on the other end..
