    I ordered a 100 tabs from HardHustle and then another 100 tabs from TylerDurden and neither of these packages showed up yet. I ordered HardHustle's on seller: HardHustle(98)
    <br/>
    contract: Standard Escrow v1.0
    <br/>
    item: 25i NBOMe 1000µg Complexed Blotters x100
    <br/>
    quantity: 1
    <br/>
    shipping: USA
    <br/>
    postage: $1.25
    <br/>
    total price: $78.67
    <br/>
    ordered: October 1, 2012, 9:07 pm UTC
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and TylerDurden's on
    <br/>
    item: Tyler tabs 1200 µg 25i-NBOMe x100
    <br/>
    quantity: 1
    <br/>
    shipping: International air mail
    <br/>
    postage: $8.73
    <br/>
    total price: $88.35
    <br/>
    ordered: October 9, 2012, 10:21 pm UTC
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's been almost a month and neither of these packages showed up, should I be worried? I receive all other mail perfectly fine and normal. I don't know what's going on but it's freaking me out. I am getting very paranoid. Is NBOMEs traceable or do I just need to wait longer for these packages to arrive? I doubt these highly reputable sellers wouldn't just ship my item so I am thinking some kind of a coincidence maybe? None of these packages have tracking numbers on them, if they did, I might have been more relieved right now.

    That is a long time for a domestic order. Have you contacted the vendors? What did they say? Did you use a real name and address? Did you stay in escrow?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are a lot of variables that can change shipping time...even just the USPS fucking up.

    I tried to contact HardHustle numerous times in messages but I guess the guy's too busy to respond so I opened up a resolution case where he just spazzed out and sounded very angry just because I tried to contact him numerous times. He basically said no refunds or no reship and just kept restating his return policy. Said buyers with no transaction history can't get reships or refunded and etc.. It took him a while to tell me that he shipped my package in the resolution messages though. He said he shipped it in an envelope and there's no tracking on it period and that I should stop "bitching" and just finalize already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I contacted TylerDurden, and he responded fairly quick and told me that it might take 20 days to come to the US, it has been around 20 days I think. In the resolution, he basically said the same thing, no refund to new buyers. This package has no tracking either...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas?

    And yes, real address was used.

    In my opinion as a buyer, if the vendor doesn't offer a DCN, then you both share in the responsibility if something goes wrong.  Neither of you can prove who is at fault.  If you're in resolution and that is the way it is going, then you should offer a settlement of 50% loss. As for the international order, you may want to extend the date and be nice to the vendor.  It could just be delayed.  I don't know what you ordered, but it could have been seized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Without a DCN who is to say that anything was ever shipped? Makes no sense to me.  It's a layer of protection for all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Little late now, but if you are a new buyer, you really, really should stick to smaller domestic orders.  Build some credibility and stay in a safe zone in case of trouble.  Once you have that relationship with a vendor(s) you can proceed to take more risk.

    Have you ordered before October 8?  Because I'm in the same situation with two different vendors, i have ordered some hash on October 3 and some meph on October 6 and nothing has arrived yet, i have also ordered some coke on october 15 and the package has arrived safe and sound (it was priority). I have good faith that the packages will arrive, i have once received a package from US 4 weeks after it has been marked as shipped by the vendor, i think mail is just a little slower than usual because of the thanksgiving long weekend..

    Yea, I actually extended the deadlines on both of these resolutions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HardHustle doesn't want to reship or refund any amount since I am a new member. I even swore on my own soul, the holy books, and everything and everyone I love that I honestly didn't receive his tabs, but he doesn't want to believe me. He can't even provide a tracking of any sort so I don't know if he really did ship it or not. He was talking about being a little behind on the orders on his profile so I really don't know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TylerDurden, the guy is in the UK so I did extend his deadline. But I am assuming the same policy for this guy goes no refund and no reshipping due to not having enough trust.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will update here as well as the resolution center if any of their tabs show up but it's strange that I wouldn't receive either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I provided the transactions above by the way, they were both 100 tab sheets. One was 1000 mg 25ci and the other was 1200 micrograms 25ci.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Below is an excerpt from the resolution center from HardHustle's words :

     "Unfortunately, even if you really didn't receive it like you say, there's no way for me to corroborate that. Anyone can come on SR, create a new account and try scamming vendors for extra product. And it doesn't matter how much you swear on the bible or whatever other bullshit, there is no way for you to prove your claims so I automatically assume they aren't true, unless you have a history on SR - which you don't. I am actually very lenient about this on my resolution policy, and I even allow buyers with three transactions or more a reship, but you have no prior transactions and therefore no credibility. As such, you must release your funds whether you received or not, because in the interest of scamming prevention, I cannot allow refunds/reships to buyers who do not have the proper history here on SR to deserve them
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The part of my resolution policy on my page that this falls under is as follows: "Roaders with less than 3 transactions will not be allowed a reship or a refund.""

I think you may even affect a permanent change for me - no more buyers with under 5 transactions? That would really cure me of a lot of these bullshit problems the new buyers are giving me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also go ahead and read my policy again and then make up some other bullshit about what you misinterpret it to say. It's right there in black and fucking white. Very straight forward. YOU'RE NOT GETTING A RESHIP OR A REFUND IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN 3 TRANSACTIONS.

    Yeah it's two weeks ago but if you remove the weekends and the thanksgiving day it's more like 14 and 11 working days (for me), sometimes it can takes up to 15+ working days for a package to arrive.

    I don't know the truth and because no DCN was used...no one does.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would encourage you to be civil and professional, ignore the threats of "you get nothing" and work within resolution center to get some of your coin back from the domestic vendor. Slam me if anyone would like, but F yourself if you don't think you share in the responsibility without some form of proof. If it comes to it, I would ask for 50% refund for the domestic ship.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If judged fairly, that is the price of doing business without DCN.  Vendors charge buyers for doing it and vendors get the benefit of know where their package is.  Be civil and ask for a share of the consequence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry you are having issues.  Again, why are you people starting out with big buys?  Can't you people wait, build your rep and do it the right way?  Sorry OP, I think you deserve 50% refund, but I'm seeing this more and more. New buyers, no stats make large orders.  Low and behold, you all get fucked up and lose money...

    Thank you for that advice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And no bid deal about $75 that I lost and then hopefully not the other $85 as well, it's just the principal I was tackling. Why are sellers allowed to ship w/out tracking and then have a no refund policy? Makes no sense to me either, I hope to see some change if any. New buyers getting fucked over is not cool.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And about proof of me not having it, I can only swear to no days on end. I can swear on every single person I love, everything I love, the Bible, Quran and the Torah, my own soul that I have never received either of these packages. Hopefully, that's proof enough for you.

    newlife, i hope you'll receive your orders, but didn't you read the vendors terms and conditions before placing your order?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a vendor clearly states "no refund or reship below 3 transactions" and you don't agree (which is your right), why would you order?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either you agree and order or you don't agree and don't order. What's this with not agreeing and still ordering? Sort of schizophrenic.
