    Okay... so i'm in the US, in a small town. I ordered 10gs from the man himself, SuperTrips.  I get lots of mail to my place, from previous residents and junk, and i MUST have missed the slip for me to pick it up. But i ended up tracking it and it said it was here on the 26th of July and sitting in my local post office.
    <br/>
    So my questions are:
    <br/>
    How many people have successfully picked shit up at the post office in the US?
    <br/>
    How many people have had this happen with orders from ST?
    <br/>
    And how good does my plan sound... My roommate and i are going to show up and he, (i will stay out of line), is going to go the front desk and ask to stop receiving mail for a particular former resident (something we actually meant to do because its fucking annoying, we get her traffic court notices every week) and then he is going to ask if there's anything for our apartment.
    <br/>
    How does that sound? If they try to say i need to specifically pick it up then i will step up and get it.
    <br/>
    What signs do i look for to know if they are dialing the cops?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What should my defense be if i get screwed?
    <br/>
    I am being paranoid... but i also can't just let 10gs slide... im broke and thats my source of income for the month.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks, and let me know soon... post office opens at 8:30 AM

    Were you suppose to sign for the package? Why wasn't it just left?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No reason to act nervous and shady; remember PO people deal with "you" ALL DAY EVERYDAY.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But please do answer the above and we can talk about it from there.

    If the cops had anything on you then they would just go to your house.

    it was from ST who makes you sign. he just messaged me back and said the same as someone else above... the cops would have came already. they wouldn't do an elaborate sting operation over 10gs
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks guys... sorry if this comes up a lot but the forum won't let me do multiple searches so i wasn't sure

    I've signed for shit at the post office several times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just think cost-benefit analysis for LE - they would have to stake out the post office during business hours with several plain clothes officers... Even more time if you have a 24/7 PO box you can pick up stuff from... It's just not worth it!  You're in the clear for sure - and so are many others with this exact same problem.

    Do not make up a "story" or act like a "fool". Go there. Request your package. Sign for it. Leave. Win.

    UPDATE:
    <br/>
    First- it went just fine. at first she said no there wasn't anything, then i asked if she checked the international packages, saying my girl orders shit online and it could be from anywhere. She got her lazy ass back to the huge pile of packages right next to her that must have been the international pile and grabbed it. So it was a great success.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second- Supertrips has CRAZY shit. I mean crazy shit. one of these rocks is 1.7 gs... for an international shipment thats huge! Barely any of it is powder, mostly shards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you all for easing my paranoia though, it really helped
