     As a buyer, should I offer to FE in exchange for DCN?

    Would you finalize early in exchange for DCN tracking number?  As a vendor would you accept such an offer from the buyer?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason I'm asking is I'm having my first negative experience here on the road after having been a member for 9 months.  I ordered USPS priority domestic to domestic from a top vendor (at least top 5%) and they have a very good standing and reputation and appear to have in excess of 1,000 transactions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, it's been 5 business days and the package hasn't arrived yet.  Mail moves Sunday too as I understand so there's been 6 days after marked in transit.  The vendor didn't respond to my message today asking for either the DCN or an update on shipping info regarding whereabouts (appears they read it with no response).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At this point all I care about is knowing where my package is and making sure it hasn't fallen into the wrong hands.  Any information the vendor can provide would be helpful yet they are leaving me hanging.  I'm desperate so I just thought if I offered to finalize now perhaps the vendor would be willing to provide me the tracking information?  I just want peace of mind and am much less concerned about the money (it's not a life changing amount by any means).  I do understand though that some vendors will not give out DCN.  Just curious what you think.

    At this point I don't feel that revealing the vendors' name will benefit him or myself as the question at hand could be answered as if it was any vendor.  Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned some of their stats, but I was simply trying to paint the picture that they seem to be trustworthy even though it's my first time using them.  I realize that the issue of shipping is out of their hands if they did in fact ship.  But their profile states that after 2-3 days after ordering if the package hasn't showed up you can message them for shipping info.  So my main concern right now is just the unresponsiveness of the vendor.  And my hope is that offering to pay now for the package that hasn't showed up will get them to respond to me.

    Why FE for a pack that, if the DCN just so happens to say delivered, i.e. mailman took your pack, then theres nothing you can do about it. but if it is a good vendor like you say, top 5%, he/she is not going to risk his/her reputation over one measly transaction. just chill out and wait on a response, its all you can do.

    Exactly. If they give you the DCN and it tells you that its missing, your screwed if you FE. If you don't and just wait it out (even though it sucks) at least you stand a chance at getting something through resolution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I were the vendor, I would probably accept the offer as it washes me of any liability.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just don't FE. Escrow is there for a reason.

    My Story
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a few good buys with him and it was always extremely professional.  I hope that TRRG is not dead or incarcerated, but it seems that his "vacation" and requiring everyone to FE indicates that this was a premeditated scam.  This may be an unpopular view, but WE DESERVED IT.  If you got ripped off YOU DESERVED IT!  I DESERVED IT.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why?  BECAUSE YOU SHOULD NEVER FE, NO MATTER WHAT!  I have read it all over the road and in the buyers and sellers guide.  More people should report sellers that ask for FE!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a problem with a vendor who was keeping addresses (liston) and I got his ass banned after he threatened to send Schedule 1 drugs to my address and provide the addy and tracking info to various LE agencies.  I was helped by Libertas and Scout, who I will always be indebted to, and in the multiple posts and conversations that we had, one thing that they said over and over, both in private and in the forum was NEVER FE, NO MATTER WHAT and if you FE and get screwed, then you are screwed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Fake Ass Rick Grimes may be a dick who deserves to be face down in a ditch, but it is us who bent over and allowed him to make us his bitch.  We all enable the few dishonest vendors and encourage this behavior.  It is MY FAULT.  It is YOUR FAULT.  Every time you FE, you encourage the few dishonest vendors to just start another account, get a little feedback, then have some bullshit reason that we have to FE.  Every time I would find some way to rationalize who I should FE at the vendor's request...and most of the time I have been treated very well and received my product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Doing this may be fine in our minds with vendors that we have dealt with and we think, I am including myself, that to FE has no bad side.  But consider this, every time an unscrupulous vendor is cruising down the road as many of us do and they see "FE for trusted vendor" they are encouraged to hatch a scheme to leave with thousands of our dollars.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be smart, don't be a retart!  I am a fucktard, just as any of you who got taken are, or at least for that instant that you were clicking the finalize link and singing his praises, as I as well as you did.  We have to realize that this is tantamount to taking your new Lexus to the bad part of town, leaving the windows down with your key in the ignition and your wallet up on the dash with a few hundreds showing.  Many who pass by will keep walking because they are honest or because they fear the consequences.  The one who decides to take a joy ride and help himself to your cash and then burns the car and is never caught may actually encourage others who are prone to bad behavior, and walked right by your car, to be the jacker the next time the situation presents itself.  Hey, they saw someone else do it and walk away so their balls are inflated and they do it as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about this:  The honest vendors are really the ones risking their asses!  The guys scamming us and taking our money like the former Mr. Grimes are pretty safe after they do their deed.  You think that LE cares that people rip off thousands of dollars from people attempting to buy drugs on here?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is not real life, it's the matrix.  You do this in real life???  If I went around to all my friends and customers and presented them with this awesome opportunity or reason that I need the money up front, then I would get it from many of them, as I have gained their trust over many years.  Then I just drove home and forgot about them and enjoyed their cash...I would need that money to pay for the surgeries afterward.  This is not the case here.  Mr. Grimes is a nameless and faceless coward and we are his willing victims.  We didn't want to get ripped off, but we did leave our Lexus in the bad part of town, with the keys and wallet in sight with the windows down and the doors unlocked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am sure that the MODS, at least two, would agree with me, as they have said not to FE.  But we, as the rebels who say "FUCK THE SYSTEM" tend to not trust our parents who tell us not to touch the stove because we will get burned.  We, especially myself, seem to have a insatiable need to feel the burn and experience the blisters and discomfort to reinforce the good advice we had already been given.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you see this in other threads, don't think I am spamming.  I just want to help us keep our hands off the stove, not because we remember the burn from before, but because we learned the lessons of history that others, DPR, the mods, and the posted literature have taught us.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I WILL NEVER DO THIS AGAIN AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN ME AND PLEDGE TO NEVER FE, EVEN IF IT IS YOUR SWEET OLD GRANDMA WHO IS THE VENDOR!

    Just chill a few more days. Don't fe. Might not get your shit at all. Might get an empty box. Who knows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    More than likely the vendor marked it IN TRANSIT way before it actually going IN TRANSIT. I have had this happen a few times. It's pretty obvious how long it takes a standard package to get across the country. However, it is really freaking irritating vendors who mark their shit in transit before it actually does. Especially, when something is marked IN TRANSIT, one would assume that it got dropped into the mail that day. After 3 days, you start thinking WTF? Then 5 days. Then 7 days. Then 10 days later it shows up. Meanwhile, all that time that's over the "should have been here by now" days you are spent thinking that you're shit got intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Give it a few days and it will arrive.

    Thanks for your advice everybody.  At this point I'm not FE and waiting to see what happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've sent another message to the vendor today to try to get some shipping info.  Dontek you are right about the in transit thing.  I did get a reply from the vendor the first time I messaged him when I was just asking to confirm that my order went out.  Even though it was marked "in transit" on a Monday, he claims it went out on Tuesday.  Not a big deal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think this vendor realizes that I'm a very understanding person and just want to be kept in the loop.  If I do get the package I'll leave a great feedback and mention nothing about the long delivery time because I realize it's no fault of the vendor.  All I want is for this guy to message me and tell me what the USPS "tracking" says.  I don't even need the number.  It's just for peace of mind.  If he would do that I would be much more inclined to ask for a smaller refund if the package never shows.  He needs to realize that I have a drop box and I need to get in my vehicle and drive every day to check my box (something I normally don't do when I'm not expecting a package) and it's costing me time and money.  At the very least he could send me a message that says sorry I can't give you tracking info or DCN tough luck.  That would kind of suck but it's better than getting no response from the vendor.  When a vendor doesn't message you back it just really makes you wonder what's going on.
