    Hey guys, been buying for about 3 months and usually comes into sydney and stays at whatever delivery facility is handling it. Then it is in my hot little hands in 1-2 days time. Its been a week, so i'm freaking out now. Anyone know what to do other than shit my pants?

    I thought it was a bad idea to post tracking info, but simply time and place is enough? didn't cross my mind.
