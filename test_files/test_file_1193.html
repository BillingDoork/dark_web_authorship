    Literally shitting my pants. It's been 10 days now since I've ordered from a very reputable vendor. I've purchased from him before so I didn't think it'd be an issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems like the vendor may be going through a mid-life crisis (too much money??? idk)... I'm not sure, regardless - it's now been 10 days since I've purchased a hefty amount of pot (hp to clear things up). I've been worried about this purchase because the vendor has only been responding once every couple days which is out of the norm for this vendor. I've checked my PO Box each day starting Wednesday - no package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've asked for the tracking number a couple times and it seems like it's beating around and has yet to provide it (maybe said vendor doesn't provide it).. Okay fine. When I asked for the package to be  tracked, the vendor said "if you dont have package by saturday let me know. not going to digg through all these tracking numbers to find something unless it is truly late."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    WHOA WHOA WHOA... I paid a significant amount of cash for this order - the LEAST they could do is give me an accurate answer on the where-a-bouts for my package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Considering it's been 10 days for this order already and has been shipped priority, what do you suspect I do?

    Something is up there's no denying that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Priority is 3-4 days. On rare occasions 5.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I recently sent out a 4 packages filled with tiny amounts over adderall. Like 10 per package and there was a package with a single pill in it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Long story short I check the tracking and it was labeled as missent so I gave the buyer 100% refund since it was only like a $15 order. He messaged me 2 weeks later saying the package arrived fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shit does happen and in this case priority took 17 days due to an error with USPS
    <br/>
    There is hope, but odds are he did not send it or they caught it.

    As stated, take the order to resolution. Request a time extension and for the vendor to provide any tracking number available to the administrator presiding over the resolution. In the meantime, as a precaution I would advise you to clean house (and check under the couches and beds for any stray product - there's always SOMETHING underneath those!)

    Unless you can prove exactly where it has come from, with evidence to support your claim, I would suggest moving it to a secure location away from your property. This is all probably nothing, but better safe than sorry.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd have to bury it in the ground to feel safe about that. And I really don't sell out of my house, at all. I don't keep anything in my home at all so I'm probably set with the exception of the cash and maybe a grinder or something like that. I agree, I think this is nothing and I hope it shows up Monday but you can't be so sure these days.

    That might not be such a bad idea - there are many safe and secure methods for doing that. It's not about selling out of your house, it is about the potential for them searching your house on the back of an intercepted / controlled delivery package. If you have unaccountable cash, unfortunately the police can and will seize it until you can prove where it came from. They will state that it is the proceeds of crime and link it to their investigation if they decide to prosecute. The reason they do this is because seized money, even if unrelated to an investigation, gets added to their budget if not claimed after a certain period of time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cleaning house means removing ALL evidence of illegality - stash the grinder as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regarding the car, if it is parked on the property then yes, they will be able to search it under the terms of the warrant. If it is parked off the property, they will likely have to get a warrant to search it but will most likely come armed with that making it pointless (and even more incriminating) to stash anything in your car even if it is parked off-property.

    I can confirm this for at least the UK that all cash will be seized, even if you have proof it's yours and legit, they still seize it. Especially if it's in a safe (their warrant covers safes,etc). Loose 20's in drawers,etc they don't bother with.. just the stacks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the car on property comment this is also true. The search warrant is for your property and anything within the property, so you would need a seperate one for the car if it's parked elsewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know all this to be true in the UK only.

    Yeah, clean house and whatnot like others have said just to be safe, but if you look around the forums USPS Priority has been SHIT lately, dude. I ordered a decent amount of MDMA from a reputable vendor last month via Priority mail and the shit took three and a half weeks to arrive. It was not opened or tampered with at all, and I'm not in jail. It just appeared in my mailbox one day after I had started to give up hope. I know shipping MDMA is safer than shipping weed but still, it took almost a month dude.

    For being so scared about the first package it was pretty bold to get a second one coming.

    What if the first one had been stopped? They would probably be looking for the second too.

    Maybe that means that your first one was not seized. Lost or maybe never shipped.

    I totally agree with that. I shouldn't have done it, but by the time I began to worry it was already ordered. I'm still puzzled as to where it could be. The vendor logged on today but didn't respond to my messages... Advice as to what I should do in the resolution center?

      Unless you can prove exactly where it has come from, with evidence to support your claim, I would suggest moving it to a secure location away from your property. This is all probably nothing, but better safe than sorry.

     I'd have to bury it in the ground to feel safe about that. And I really don't sell out of my house, at all. I don't keep anything in my home at all so I'm probably set with the exception of the cash and maybe a grinder or something like that. I agree, I think this is nothing and I hope it shows up Monday but you can't be so sure these days.

    The warrant will most definitely say right on it that they can search any vehicle registered to any person named on the warrant and they will, thoroughly.

    Literally? Pepto bismol dude. If it is because of full on diarrhea then I would suggest some fiber supplement too. Fiber is a thickening agent. Last but not least don't leave the house if at all possible. Only make short trips when absolutely necessarily. You don't want to be at the gym or at the pool and have an explosive eruption of diarrhea. Best of luck.

    I am in a similar situation. My order was placed 14 days ago and was shipped 11 days ago. All of my other 30+ past (not from the current vendor) orders have arrived in 2-4 days.
    <br/>
    I came across this thread about recent USPS shipping: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156241.30
    <br/>
    And it seems that more than a few people have been experiencing unusual/slow transit times recently. I HOPE that this is what is happening to me, as well as you, and nothing more than poor USPS performance. But I'd still like my damn package. Plus I'm concerned about the auto-finalization date approaching.

    Hmmm. so the vendor ultimately offered a 100% refund which I accepted however; it completely fucked up my purchasing stats...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It pisses me off knowing that it was not my fault at all. The vendor said the tracking "said" it was returned to sender because it was a faulty address or no one was there to sign for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My other orders came in just fine and why the fuck would I have to sign for it?

    True, but the way it was handled made me think it wasn't even shipped out to begin with. When I went to the resolution center to get this resolved, he didn't provide a tracking number - instead just immediately offered a 100% refund and proceeded to throw the blame on me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Point of this is, it was clearly not my fault that it was being returned to sender. Now my account stats are fucked, albeit not all that much, but regardless. On top of that, the vendor wasted 13 days on this order. Fucked?

    Yea man that sucks..It really sounds like there was some mistake on the end of the vendor..but its over..and your stats,  I mean vendors can not be that hung up on it..unless they are like obvious shitty stats..which it doesnt sound like..could have been worse. It is annoying though, waiting and all that mess..and nothing..and then get blamed for nothing..time for a different vendor for sure

    I too have a missing package from the same vendor. The vendor mentioned checking tracking but has yet to reply for a couple days though he has been online. Hopefully he gets back to me, but I will be entering resolution tomorrow. I had thought usps may be taking their time, but that is seeming less likely as days pass. I believe I'm on day 10 from shipping and in the neighborhood of 13 or so from order.

    I had a package take 2 full weeks one time..Lol Horrible.

    <br/>
    Well since 100% refund was given, that's a good thing. Who knows maybe they did ship it and it'll come in? Or it could be that he shipped it to the wrong buyer....Can't say it never happens.
