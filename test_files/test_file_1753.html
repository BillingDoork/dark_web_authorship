    As recent as January of this year you could go buy an American Express gift card, call in to register an address (anonymous drop obviously), then use it to order stamps online. This was the only anonymous card that I found that would work with USPS.com website, but I tried it with 2 different Amex cards of two different denominations the other day and neither worked. The website rotated 2 different error messages each time I tried it. One essentially said the card was declined. The other said to check that the information was correct.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I called Amex and they said USPS was drafting the payment but was immediately putting the funds back. This means the information is correct or otherwise they never would have pulled the money out at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My theory is that during the overhaul earlier this year that they (USPS) somehow changed their online processing to detect gift cards (even ones that can have an address associated with them) and reject them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Anyone know of a different card that doesn't get rejected? I have a registered green dot in someone else's name. Would that work or do they reject reloadable debits too?

    Nope not just amex. I had the same problem today with a One Vanilla visa. Really pissed me off. After much thinking and a large intake of pills I did manage to find a work around for this problem. It was quite simple actually and I should of thought it sooner. If anyone needs to know PM me and I;ll share my discovery :)
