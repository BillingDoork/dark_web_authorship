    Hi I don't want to use my name anymore it's sketching me out. So an idea that came up is to use "Mr and Mrs. LAST NAME (enter my last name there). Would that help any at all with probable deniability? I'm sure they would deliver the package as I have relatives who send me mail using that tittle. Thoughts? Any other ideas?!

    You could always try using a made up company name. In this day and age there are TONS of ebay/ online small companies, so id venture to say it wouldn't be suspicious at all. Make sure it is a nice, simple/ believable company name and you'll be fine!

    Depends on what country you live in, if its the US then names are linked to addresses so using a fake name will cause you to come unstuck. In Australia you could address it to Mickey Mouse and the post would deliver it, as such I use random fake names all the time and have never had a problem. Obviously whatever name you do use though try and make is look believable! John Smith is not the way to go.

    I'm pretty sure there is a government entity that has a record of where all the registered citizens are living in the country... I would imagine anyone could query this record, and even order large batches for identification/verification/anti-fraud purposes.

    You're taking quite a risk by using a fake name -- most vendors will not offer any kind of refund or reshipment if the package doesn't get to you when you're using fake info.

    Using Mr and Mrs is fine, but fake names can cause you hassle. If a postman regularly delivers your mail he knows the names of the occupants, if he sees foreign mail addressed to a new name he will get suspicious.

    This has been discussed many many times but it keeps coming up. If you live in a metropolitan area I can guarantee you will receive mail addressed to the previous occupants and/or random people all the time. I can only speak for the Australian situation but I have never had an issue using fake names. It might be different if you live in bum fuck nowhere with a population of 5 then yes I can imagine using a fake name might raise some interest but in capital cities there is no chance it's going to cause you an issue, in Australia anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get things are different in the US where names and addresses are linked, in countries like Australia this is not the case. Make your own mind up, if you want to order drugs to your home address addressed to your real name then go for it, you are more game than me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If using a fake name is obviously going to cause you issues then do not do it, the point I am making is there are many situations you can do it without issue. I know if it came to it I would rather be saying "oh sorry officer I do not know anyone of that name living at this residence" compared to answering "can you please explain why you have this parcel of drugs addressed to you that has been sent in the mail?".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Each to their own I guess and I know this will continue to get bounced around the forums...

    I live in the US. One time when ordering something from the internet (not from SR) I used the name "Turd Furgeson" just as a joke. My shipment came with no issues. However, that was just one instance for legal goods. I don't do that when ordering from SR.

    Dankbank, even if you do start your own ebay business, that's not really going to do for you what you're trying to do.  Technically, you're supposed to do a "change of address" for for the new ebay business you're starting, so the PO knows it's okay to deliver mail there.  US addresses come attached to a name or a business.  If a different name is on the envelope then, sure, it might get delivered anyway.  Probably will.  But, it's just as plausible that the mail carrier, who may have been working that same route for the last ten years, will kick it back as a bad address because the name doesn't match what's registered to the address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're getting your SR shipments sent to your home address, it doesn't look suspicious at all for your name to be on the envelope.  It would look suspicious, however, if you were trying to use a fake name or a fake business name.  People buy shit off of ebay all the time.  The USPS doesn't think that repeated receipts of Priority Mail or any other kind of USPS packages, in and of themselves, are suspicious.  The package itself could be suspicious, but that's a whole separate issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think you're overthinking this.

    i was reading on usps site about proper address labels, came across this quote and remembered this thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "--Sometimes it’s not important that your mailpiece reaches a specific customer, just that it reaches an address. One way to do this is to use a generic title such as "Postal Customer" or "Occupant" or "Resident," rather than a name, plus the complete address."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think it might look odd for a package but maybe not an envelope
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Mail with an occupant or an exceptional address format is delivered as addressed and is not forwarded. Such mail is treated as undeliverable only when the address is incorrect or incomplete or when the mail cannot be delivered for another reason related solely to the address (e.g., a vacant building)"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    [1-27-13] Alternative addressing formats may not be used on:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a. Express Mail pieces.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    b. Mail with any ancillary service endorsement under 507.1.1 through 507.1.8.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    c. Periodicals intended to count as subscriber or requester copies to meet the applicable circulation standards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    d. Mail addressed to an overseas military Post Office under 703.2.2.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    e. The following extra services:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Registered Mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Certified Mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. Insured mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Return receipt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5. Restricted delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    6. Return receipt for merchandise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    7. Signature Confirmation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    8. Collect on delivery (COD).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so looks like priority box is ok..?

    Don't think it would effect the deniability of it all very much.  You could always make the speculation that someone apparently found your name/address and started using you as a patsy for their drug shipping activities.

     If you're getting your SR shipments sent to your home address, it doesn't look suspicious at all for your name to be on the envelope.  It would look suspicious, however, if you were trying to use a fake name or a fake business name.  People buy shit off of ebay all the time.  The USPS doesn't think that repeated receipts of Priority Mail or any other kind of USPS packages, in and of themselves, are suspicious.  The package itself could be suspicious, but that's a whole separate issue.

     I think you're overthinking this.

    Yea I get mail addressed to other people a couple times a month. The address is right but the names are people who I guess used to live here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Letters addressed to current resident are also common. Companies send out promotional items, samples coupon books etc all the time.
    <br/>

    I think people believe postal workers have more power than they really do. If it has the right postage on it and it is a proper address than the postal worker is supposed to deliver it. God help a mail man who does not deliver mail addressed to mickey mouse at "x" address and latter it turns out that someone named mickey mouse does live there. I doubt they would risk their job because they don't like the name on the envelope.

    Weird things have happened to people and you want to get your mail so don't get too creative.

    Keep things simple.

    The fake name issue is weird. Obviously it can cause problems because vendors have become sensitive to it, but answer me this: what happens when I rent out a room in my place and somebody moves in? If they aren't forwarding mail there from an older address, all the post office knows is suddenly this person is getting mail at this address (in addition to mine). I've never heard of that resulting in no mail for the new tenant. That would be awfully strange.

    If I were going to go the small business route, I'd print a sticker and put it on my mailbox for the carrier to see. MINT COLLECTIBLES or AGE OLD WOODWORKING or MISANTHROPE GREETING CARDS. Whatever. Keep it for a couple of months then toss the sticker.

    Exactly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The post office doesn't know who lives with you and doesn't care.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a friend stay with me for a couple of months and just put their name on the box. She had no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A fake name can have its problems so just be smart about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If something should go wrong and your mail does not show up you don't want the vendor or SR to say you screwed up. So don't do anything too wacky.
