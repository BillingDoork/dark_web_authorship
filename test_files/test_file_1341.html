    As I was replying to someones post about how to get tracking stickers it just hit me. The whole reason vendors use tracking is in the case of scammers saying they never received the product but the thing is I think we've all been looking at this with tunnel vision. Who's to say that we have to use USPS tracking method.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The solution to this problem mind you it's just hypothetical would be if Silk Road funded a mini GPS tracker to be made that would be supplied to the vendors. I know that's asking a lot but this help in building and maintaining Silk Roads distribution channels. From a security standpoint I think it would be safe. Say if a Vendor was really LE well the GPS tracker doesn't matter cause he already knows your address. Now I suggest the GPS tracker to provided by the Silk Road staff as they are the only ones we can know are 100% trustworthy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The flaw I see in my idea however is say a vendor receives his lot of GPS tracking devices from Silk Road admin but in reality it's from someone else say LE for example. To prevent this a two authentication protocol could be put into place to confirm the authenticity of the sender. Ok this was just off the top of my head... let the flaming commence...

    No it's ok you don't have to apologize I suspected my idea was retarded a bit however it seems a lot of ppl are struggling with the whole practice of getting tracking stickers anonymously. Obviously there must be a way if other vendors are doing it so more power to them. I guess if you can't figure it out then you shouldn't be a vendor huh?

    Well w/e it can't be more retarded than the idiots on the shipping forums going into 50 different Post Offices trying to get tracking stickers saying 'Oh yeah I need it for my grandmother. She needs to ship out stuff and she doesn't have a computer so she asked me to come here to get those green stickers. Can I have a roll of like 500 please?' And my idea is retarded? At least it was creative.

    This is a Horrible idea for more than one reason. Your idea has disaster writing all over. The vendors who are selling drugs and sending them through the mail are suppose to 100% with their freedom trust SR? I dont mean the Admins an all now really, but what if it was fully compromised? all LE would have to do to Bust every damn vendor is look at where they are sent from an sent to. Its a terrible idea

    I dont see how it would protect the buyers or vendors. If anything it will expose more info, an cause issues in the long run of someone having the information of knowing where vendors live.

    Not to mention think of the money that would have to be invested. Also the electronics.

    That's way I said 'hypothetically' at the beginning. A shitty little gps unit costs $35 and the amount of packages that are sent out daily... well that would add up quick.  What about that device that some ppl on here were talking about making that would be able to alert the receiver if the package was tampered with. I don't remember correctly but wasn't that going to have a gps built into it? That was awhile ago anyways so not sure if I can find that thread,

    That device is an RFID chip connected to some photosensitive cells. If someone opens the package, the memory of the RFID is wiped. To know if it's been opened you can just check the unique code on the RFID from a small distance (so while the package is still closed). That's way less expensive than a GPS tracker and it isn't able to locate you.
