    hi guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just a quick question.....im still a SR virgin, but looking to order soon...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my question is: has anyone ever successfully received a package to thailand?? im on one of the islands in the south.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is it worth the risk? or should i wait until im back in the uk to place an order? having said that it would be nice to have some mdma while im here. off to the beach now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any answers or comments welcome
    <br/>

    I'm in Vietnam and would love to know the asnwer to this as well.Â  Every time I've had a package here in the past, I had to sign for it, so it seems like not worth the risk.

    Mate im guessing your a tourist or not from SE asia. Do you have no clue of their Drug Laws? Basically going anywhere near drugs in SE Asia is a big no-no. They have heaps of legal drugs anyway.

    Trying to find Drugs in Thailand as a foreigner is not easy. You never know who to trust. Many times cops pose as dealers to nab unsuspecting tourist s or expats. Dealesr will turn foreigners in to the cops at a drop of a dime. You just cannot start asking around for drugs here. SR maybe the best way for a determined foreign drug buyer in Thailand. I trust he mail more than the drug scene here.

    Thailand has mandatory death sentences for &gt;certain amounts. Just enjoy all the legal benzos and RC's and get on the roids and start going to the gym. Dont risk doing 10 years in the Bangkok Hilton for a couple of grams
