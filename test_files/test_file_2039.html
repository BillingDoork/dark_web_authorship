    Hello, i wonder if anyone has some experience with shipping fake clothes or other items such as watches, glasses to Europe?
    <br/>
    What is the risk? What's the best way to send?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tnx a lot!

    Like I said before, you can say you thought you were buying legitimate versions of the clothing. It's pretty common to get ripped off by buying fake shit around here, cops never get mad at you for buying it only the people selling it.

    Yeah, you are right about that. But there must be invoice. If there is real (low) price it would be obvious. If they give me fake invoice, i would pay tax i guess. However, i might really try that. :)

    Tnx for idea!
