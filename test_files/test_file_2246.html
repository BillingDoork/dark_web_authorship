    I'm a total idiot, i didn't sign a declaration on top of parcel envelope saying that this is hazardous material etc. etc. and they returned it to an actual business, from whom i included a fake invoice (because I'm super paranoid). The object in question was a vial of liquid. And the invoice made it out to appear as an innocuous thing to send over the mail. But i have never had one returned to the actual place of business. (So I'm assuming the business opened the envelope and to their surprise found an invoice with their name on it, but looks absolutely nothing like it does, but it does use one of the employee's actual name)
    <br/>
    I'm really sorry i can't go much into detail, naturally I'm resending the product, but how fucked am I? How fucked is the customer who's address is on that envelope? I'm really panicking what should i do? (Apart from making sure the envelopes are signed for)

    I'm no expert on this, but I'd say you're totally straight. Regardless of what the business does (probably nothing), the USPS can never find you. The worst that happens is that it's seized. The customer is fine too, especially with a fake return address that would lead to a fake delivery I would think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plus a small amount of drugs (if they even bother to test it) does not warrant a controlled delivery.

    But I'll defer to someone else on this.

    So i'm sort of afraid of the buyer's address more than anything, because i labeled the invoice with the actual bottle containing certain legal chemicals pertaining to the business. So i don't suspect anything more than some confusion around the office, but what would happen if that bottle, saying it contains perfectly legal chemicals, do not ingest etc. etc. was brought to the LE would it be tested?

    I think your fake invoice could be the thing that might make them look into it a bit more. You just better hope whoever runs the mail room there doesn't take their job too seriously and just throws it out, but I would say there is a good chance someone will just sign the declaration and send it back on its way.

    No reason to freak out. The buyer on the other hand; I hope you have told him the situation.. he really needs to know so he can clear out his house from anything illegal just in case.
