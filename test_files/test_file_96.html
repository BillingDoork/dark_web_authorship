   <dd class="postbody">
    so im thinking about starting to sell some "baked" goods on sr and for packaging i figured i would put the goods in a small box if its a single order and put that box in a zip lock or vacuum seal it then put it into a bigger USPS box and put crumpled up paper around the smaller box to provide cushion and to keep the package from having uneven weight distribution then put a layer of hot glue on the inside of the flaps and tape it up with 2 layers of tape and get printed labels.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    would this work good i just want to be careful and i live in a small town in the Midwest and i don't even know if we have any package drop offs for USPS ik we have ups but from what i heard im sticking to USPS i think you have to take it to the counter should i just get a bunch of orders ready and take them to a larger city (about a half an hr away) and drop them off like every Monday or something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and also i was wondering about the names and addresses to you think it would be smart for example to put (KILROYS-Ebay) as the senders name or something like that to look less suspicious. also should i put random address for return or should i put the same address all the time like an abandoned farm house ik about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is their anything else i need to or should know any help would be appreciated

    honestly, if you are going to be doing baked good, i would try and make it look as legit as possible, seal it so that it looks like some food you could order off of a clearnet website. it would be worth it to invest in some form of food packaging with stickers or something to make it look like a legit food goods company. if you do that, i feel like you would have a much better chance of it being successful. hope this helps :)

    no prob, you have to take the assumption that your package will get opened by the wrong people, so you have to think of what would look normal if it was opened. to me, if i opened a package with a legit label and seal, i would think nothing of it. hopefully you can figure out the best way for this to work, or even create your own labels with a bar code and everything to make it look legit as possible. good luck man :)

    Edibles seem like they would be super-easy.  Package it as a care package from Grandma or something.  Unless the smell alerts the dogs, it would be a real stretch to run cookies through a GS/MS machine to test for THC.
