    So i have ordered a package that is tracked, in customs for more then a month now so wont come for sure. Now when i ask for reship vendor tells me same adress use to work for reships, and all will be good. Amount that was taken by customs was big and would get me the hardest penalty there is concerning drugs. No LE in sight under this month and no loveletter so im thinking this is a scamattempt by the vendor because of these things. The reship isnt 100% so he would earn a lot of money on the scam if it is. Also this vendor was top notch with a very high % that have dropped A LOT since my order, so more ppl are in the same situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *Police would DEF come to my house with these kind of amounts with a h warrant.
    <br/>
    *Adress would be ultraflagged with those amounts, then why would he say the same adress often works for reships, i mean this is BIG amounts.
    <br/>
    * I dont think this seller would be stupid/mean enough to get his customers into such big troubles as that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My thought are that he sent a semi-illegal thing that easily got spotted by customs and destroyd just to get a tracked package that was stopped or some other method i dont know about....how do they do the track-scams? :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could it take more than a month for LE to come to search my house?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help is useful here, thanks in advance and excuse me for the bad english :)

    Agreed ^^
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You say your quantity was enough to get you arrested, count yourself lucky that you haven't been picked up by the cops. Move on, find a new drop and do some more research to see if the no-show is a trend with other buyers using the same vendor.

    Personally I would never use an address after a confirmed no show. If your seized order was of a sizable quantity customs and LE could be investigating you before taking action so be ultra careful, clean house and make sure you leave no trace or incriminating evidence laying around, I would consider redacting your hard drives too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And as for the vendor suggesting you using the same address for the reship then they are a fucking liability IMHO. It won't be them hauled in for questioning and potentially charged or have their home ransacked of heavy handed police as they toss the place.

    Hey man,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would tell that vendor no WAY you will accept another package to that address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had 1 seizure, and ever since then I literally went out of town with my other orders, and made sure to order to people's houses that had no direct connect to me, it was always friends of friends houses. I mean each drop cost me 150-225 dollars, but it was worth it. Ask friends who need money if you can ship it there..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have since gotten legal items from other states and even "hot" states to my addy, and I can't tell that USPS opened the package, but I still take no chances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good Luck man

    Ya, I wouldn't do it. You can easily pay someone to setup a box or ship to their house or whatever you feel is best. But i wouldn't risk it.
