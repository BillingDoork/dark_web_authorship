    I'm just brainstorming some ideas on getting an anonymous drop. What do you guys think about this idea?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What if I got some random homeless person (there's no shortage around here) to open a PO Box for me? I'd offer them some cash for the service and make sure they have an ID beforehand. I'm thinking give them however much it costs to open the box up front (and be prepapred to lose it if shit goes wrong) and give them their payment after they've given me the keys and all the paperwork. And I'd have some bullshit story made up for why I need them to do this if they ask.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everybody wins, right? The homeless person gets some quick cash and I get an anonymous PO Box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you think? Yay or nay? Any potential risks you can think of that I'm not seeing? I'm in the US, btw.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    it might work, but you need a drivers license to open p.o box and they take your address off the license.
    <br/>
    and homeless people don't have an address. so no
    <br/>
    get a friend to open the box and offer cash or cut of the drugs. you have to use the friends name to receive mail,
    <br/>
    or get him to add your name to the box.

    Not planning on using a name to receive mail at the PO Box. Planning on using a business name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But that's a good point about the address on the license. I'd have to look at their ID before hand to see if there's an address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other thoughts?
    <br/>

    Appreciate it ;D

    Thanks for the suggestion. It was something I was thinking about, but ever since the secret service fake ID sting, I'm having second thoughts about it. Now I'm just brainstorming other options....

    The IDs on here are mediocre at best and the vendors are middle manning the orders from clearnet fake ID suppliers.Â  They may be good enough for buying alcohol or getting in a club but not for handing to a government worker.

    Please enlighten me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What use is a PO box anyway? When you go pick up your shit from there, there is no more plausible deniability? If your shipment is compromised and let through and LE keeps an eye on the box, then you go and get it, there is not much you can do is there?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is shipped to a real person with a real address, you (or the person who its addressed to) can always deny it being yours, right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there something I'm missing here?

    There are many 24 Hour PO Boxes with no visible cameras anywhere in the Post Office. Not the majority of them, but I seems to find them in any major metropolitan area I go to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, yeah, I guess they could flag a PO box and camera it up...but if you're going in there when no one is in there you could have a baseball cap with a camera blinding light, football makeup on your cheekbones, or just a hat and sunglasses. It's really difficult to imagine cops staking out a PO box for 24 hours a day for a long time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This all gets much more anonymous if you have one than more box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And all of this would require first, of course, a package sent to one of these PO boxes that extremely suspicious looking or smells like drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Getting one or multiple PO Box(es) of PMB(s) in a 24 hour, lightly or non-camera'd spot through multiple degress of separation from the box owner(s) seems like the most legit way of getting shipments.

    Ok, I see :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We don't have 24h PO boxes around here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still, for a bulk overseas shipment I could see LE arranging a 24h stake out, no? Then you'd be in serious trouble...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the info anyways!

    Yeah, of course. But that's why you let those shipments sit a few days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly, if you're buying international shipments from someone who doesn't used at LEAST a double vacuum seal (Preferably MBB's) with other concealatory elements to protect it from customs...then you shouldn't be ordering from overseas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Having multiple PO Boxes helps with the bulk issue, too. If you have PO boxes in different locations with different names of people owned by people you've never met, all 24 hour locations with no cameras in the lobby...then the chances at least decrease somewhat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing is perfect though. I get what you are saying.
