    Does anyone have assumptions or insight into any extra security measures that might be imposed during the holiday season? (particularly with international shipping - germany to us) I don't mind waiting due to the heavy load of mail, I just want to decrease my chances of getting seized - duh. Muchos gracias.

    They can bring in more resources, but at best the coverage will be same as normal day-to-day post. More likely even with the added resources there will be less coverage.

    Was wondering the same last week, i reasoned that most traffic would be cards and small pakets and maybe business envelopes might stand out more than usual, does the business world finish up early for the holiday, prob not and invoice are getting sent to bak up purchases so..... what the hell, got a couple in the pipeline....

    Hey All,
    <br/>
    Just thought I would see if anyone here has experience with delivery times during the Christmas period.
    <br/>
    I am waiting on several orders which were all sent out today to the UK.
    <br/>
    Without going into specifics, all the orders are from EU countries which are relatively close to the UK, in my experience delivery usually takes 3 days. Is it still likely to be 3 days even though we are so close to Christmas?
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance,
    <br/>
    -Life

    Wait, you think because of the incredible volume of mail increase there will be more security and scrutiny on packages? That thought is a serious contender for the most backwards use of logic I have ever seen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The postal service is dealing with the highest volumes of the year. All of the postal workers are working the hardest they work every year right now. They just want to sort their packages, get their mail delivered and get home. That is all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course same practices apply. But the increase in volume is a good thing. Not a bad thing.

    I am in the same boat with shipped date and country, but to Canada. Seems pretty normal for this time of year from what I am reading, and apparently German post is always pretty slow regardless of the season.
