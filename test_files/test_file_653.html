    I wish there was an ignore user button to push that after so many ignores in a 24 hour period the user is ruled as spam and booted automatically. Or just an ignore button so I dont have to depend on someone else to boot the spam for me. This doesnt really seem like the appropriate topic for this thread... jus sayin.  no offense!

    Amen AA I have hated this shit for the past 6+ months this douche bag has been doing it, it makes it 100 times worse that he does not just one spamming thread trying to rip people off for BTC but he'll fill up a whole fucking page on every topic, I wish some hacker person that is on here could figure out who and where is doing it and hit them with something that would ruin their PC or something.  Oh yes by the way you have my vote please feel free to destroy this person or person's I would gladly vote you any authority to do so!:)

    Not tryin to be a dick, but I don't think this will or SHOULD happen.  I don't think people asking to be given censoring power should get it. Nothing against you, but I think the mods we have now are commendable, but I've even seen them censor stuff.  That's not cool or acceptable here.  I do think someone who is online during the off-hours should be given moderator status, but as far as who that choice would be, that's up to the admins.  In a few hours more people will be getting on including some mods and the spam will get deleted/pushed down.
