    Colombia is on the "watch" list for imports to most countries. Means your shit would be gone through thoroughly so hide it well.

    It's incredibly hard, a small percentage will get though but not enough to make it economically viable, most people I've heard of buy the cocaine in Columbia and drive to Brazil and post it from there, but even then that's a very poor method of smuggling, there's much better ways.

    Sorry for that. Any advice on how to smuggle it? Current thoughts are 1-5 kilos = 1-5 drug mules full of balloons .

    I think a seller in Colombia could have a real nice business selling clean grams on here for $60.  I bet vacuum packed grams from Colombia to US or Europe will have just as high a success rate as, say, NL to US, and that's pretty good.  Customs is too buys looking for the big things from Colombia, IME.

    Get a big book and use the old method of e.g. hide some alcohol in it, but now you just hide the vacuum sealed drugs in it.
    <br/>
    Vacuum seal the book, let print yourself a bill for a book by your vendor, just in case there should be any control.
    <br/>
    If you're forced to open, there is the book inside your package and you want to let it sealed, because you're a collector.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a thinking on the topic, don't know if that method really can do it in practice, if you want to hear more ideas of smuggling more huge amounts of drugs via mail, pn me, i won't post 'em public ;)

    If South American SR vendors could build up the same kind of volume of small value packages that we've managed to across the rest of the world, the only viable way of stopping it would make the postal service unusable for the rest of the public. And that would result in brilliant free advertising for Silk Road and Bitcoin as a result. DPR, I would sincerely like to have your babies. I would consider a sex change, depending on your gender of course.

    Hey im from colombia(no kidding) there are very few ways to smugle anything out and not getting it detected and seized, so you can get a grasp of the dificulties of it by knowing that often smuglers build single use fiberglass(no radar signature) submarines to export the coke (a third world country with the biggest disposable navy).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i currently find its a better bussiness to export some presciption drugs like modafinil or something else because if you try to buy it in any farmacy here you are rarely asked for the actual prescription and also are dirt cheap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    by the way why is that the site registration form excludes colombia from the list? it really pisses me off.
