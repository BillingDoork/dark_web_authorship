    Hello, I've been a buyer on the road for months with no problems until now. The one day that I don't check the mail, a relative receives something in my name and of course being the privacy-raiding fucks they are, decide to open it. I get called into the other room and get asked if I ordered anything, and I'm thinking "Shit, a package must have come early." but to my surprise, no. Instead, it's a letter from a sheriff's office, pretty much said that members of some Triad HIDTA Interdiction Task Force identified it as MDMA/Mephamphetamine with a presumptive field test after canines found it to be narcotics during a daily x-ray scan. I'm fucking confused, because well, first off, I've never once even ordered anything other than Methylone or MDPV, and those wouldn't test as meth or MDMA, and it also states it was from around January 5-6th, and I wasn't expecting any mail at all around that time. Now that I think of it, my usual vendors don't even supply meth/mdma, did someone fuck me over or what? I have no idea how this happened but it's getting me into trouble. I instantly destroyed any envelopes and deleted any evidence from my laptop, deleted Tor, and used Eraser to get rid of a few information files. Now for the other subject...the packages still coming in...2 days ago or so, I got some molly for a friend along with some 6-apb pellets domestic and they've already been shipped out. That letter came from a checkpoint in the US so I don't know if my address would be flagged or not, and pretty sure others in my house will be trying to get my mail before I do from now on. My guess is that I should just destroy all evidence and wipe my computers of everything ahead of time to prepare incase my mail is being monitored. Any advice or general answers to how the fuck I got sent that shit?

    I'd nuke everything from orbit, act incredulous when anyone brings up the subject, and deny everything. I found this which may be helpful:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Signs of Deception:
    <br/>
    Body Language of Lies:
    <br/>
    • Physical expression will be limited and stiff, with few arm and hand movements. Hand, arm and leg movement are toward their own body the liar takes up less space.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • A person who is lying to you will avoid making eye contact.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Hands touching their face, throat &amp; mouth. Touching or scratching the nose or behind their ear. Not likely to touch his chest/heart with an open hand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Emotional Gestures &amp; Contradiction
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Timing and duration of emotional gestures and emotions are off a normal pace. The display of emotion is delayed, stays longer it would naturally, then stops suddenly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Timing is off between emotions gestures/expressions and words. Example: Someone says "I love it!" when receiving a gift, and then smile after making that statement, rather then at the same time the statement is made.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Gestures/expressions don’t match the verbal statement, such as frowning when saying “I love you.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Expressions are limited to mouth movements when someone is faking emotions (like happy, surprised, sad, awe, )instead of the whole face. For example; when someone smiles naturally their whole face is involved: jaw/cheek movement, eyes and forehead push down, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Interactions and Reactions
    <br/>
    • A guilty person gets defensive. An innocent person will often go on the offensive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • A liar is uncomfortable facing his questioner/accuser and may turn his head or body away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • A liar might unconsciously place objects (book, coffee cup, etc.) between themselves and you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Verbal Context and Content
    <br/>
    • A liar will use your words to make answer a question. When asked, “Did you eat the last cookie?” The liar answers, “No, I did not eat the last cookie.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    •A statement with a contraction is more likely to be truthful: “ I didn't do it” instead of “I did not do it”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Liars sometimes avoid "lying" by not making direct statements. They imply answers instead of denying something directly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • The guilty person may speak more than natural, adding unnecessary details to convince you... they are not comfortable with silence or pauses in the conversation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • A liar may leave out pronouns and speak in a monotonous tone. When a truthful statement is made the pronoun is emphasized as much or more than the rest of the words in a statement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Words may be garbled and spoken softly, and syntax and grammar may be off. In other
    <br/>
    words, his sentences will likely be muddled rather than emphasized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • The use of distancing language.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also see our article on Statement Analysis for a more in-depth look at word analysis techniques used by interrogators.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other signs of a lie:
    <br/>
    • If you believe someone is lying, then change subject of a conversation quickly, a liar follows along willingly and becomes more relaxed. The guilty wants the subject changed; an innocent person may be confused by the sudden change in topics and will want to back to the previous subject.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Using humor or sarcasm to avoid a subject.

    <br/>
    Are you thinking this is from an international package?  Or they scanned a domestic pack and caught it?

    actually amico I believe  MDPV  WILL test positive as an MDxx compound with a marquis test  :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And that they mentioned a K9 found it suggests it's true.   I'm not trying to scare you, it's just  that IF a dog tagged it, and then they tested the mdpv with one of those little sachets they use to test for MDxx and amphetamines, for a color reaction, it's 99% likely to be a marquis reagent in the bag, and it WILL turn dark blue, just as  mdxx and amphetamine do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The dogs often pick up on a number of scents and the more experienced they are at finding various type of substituted phenethylamines like mdma and mdpv, they learn to tag things which have the basic similarities in the overall smell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dogs "smell in color '... just like we 'smell in black and white'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just like if you saw this page in B&amp;W you wouldn't be able to see the tiny bit of red on this tongue :P  But coz our color resolution is HD, we can see very small differences
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If we compared how we smell, compared to  how a dog smells, we smell in black and white and dogs smell in HD color, and they can detect very small differences in smells, and will pick up on incredibly small amounts.   What I'm trying to say is this is a quite realistic possibility
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The dog alerted the  handlers who opened the pack, found something they tested that came back positive to amp/mdxx .... I'd guess they used a simple field test which later more sophisticated testing will reveal it is an MDxx analogue aka mdpv
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OR...what you were sent WAS mdma and tested as such after discovery,  that's possible, vendor mix up or something  :-\
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd let it go, clean up and keep your mouth shut .... all the time about this to anyone who asks   You know nothing, and that's that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully you have some plausible deniabiilty....like it's been sent to a different name, which only you know about, so you know whats in the package when you see the recipient
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then if you DO collect it and are worried, you write "return to sender" and leave it on the shelf for a week--if they come looking for it, you'll be able to give it to them while claiming no knowledge of the contents, and that you were meaning to repost it back to the sender, just hadn't got around to it...if they don't come in a week they won't...you're ok for now
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's to a pseudonym you've got a good defence, as long as you say NOTHING else to LE without a LAWYER there with you...this cannot be stressed enough!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry to hear about this bro,  all the best with it

    Sounds like they're just trying to fuck with you. The "canines found it to be narcotics during a daily x-ray scan." So who's the hero the dogs or the x-ray?
    <br/>
    I believed MDMA and MA would show up on the same test because they share an amphetamine skeleton whereas MDPV does not?

    I thought MDPV showed up yellow similar to methlyone, it does have the MD component though.  Methamphetamine shows up orange / reddish.  There's not really any mistaking it unless they are dumb cops.

    If its in your name maybe it was a vendor mistake? Somehow mixed the packages up?

    It was a domestic package most likely, I normally don't order internationally.
    <br/>
    My usual vendors do not sell MDMA/methamphetamine, unless they're either cutting my PV with meth, or they have their own personal supply of it and sent some by accident, I don't know what the problem may be. Maybe the cops were just lazy and instead of testing, they just assume it was MDMA/methamphetamine? That came to mind as well.

    To me "presumptive field test" sounds like LE jargon for "we found some white powder and it doesn't numb your gums so it's probably not coke. So we presume it's MDMA or meth"
    <br/>
    I wouldn't be racking my brains over this aspect of your problem. Obviously they have intercepted one package, and may now be checking for more. Clean house and don't accept any more packages. As someone already said, if they were planning to raid you they wouldn't have sent you a warning, but it's better to err on side of caution

    I think you're right here,  it also depends on the  testing reagent used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IIRC  one of them (I thought the Marquis for some reason) reacted to the methylene dioxy bridge of the compound hence the "mistake" if they used that particular test.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The advice to lay low for a while is what I'd suggest again, and as hungry ghost said, dont rack your brains over it...see it as a 'good' thing...you've been warned to be extra careful with that name and address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully it's a fairly common one  ;)
