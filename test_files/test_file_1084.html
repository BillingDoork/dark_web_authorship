    Just ask for some from a retail postal clerk.  If you want to have a perfectly plausible(and true) explanation ready ...you'd like to be able to use the USPS blue drop boxes for your stamped, outgoing parcels so as to avoid waiting in line.

    call the ordering number off the usps website restricted and give them fake name true address.
    <br/>
    or do the exact same thing only make a free (but fake-ish) account with usps.com and order them
    <br/>
    for free. you can get up to 2000 at a time (max order of 4 500 packs) unless you call the number then you can get more.
    <br/>
    also its free for priority so keep that in mind. all you have to do is slap one of those bad boys on your
    <br/>
    package to the left of the address its being sent to and your good to go. (only for priority mail and first class)
    <br/>
    i know this because i actually called a post office recently with all the details on them.

    If USPS tracks which numbered stickers went to what address and what credit card paid for them, they might be able to track a package back to that info.. They also might be able to link all packages sent from that person for greater scrutiny. I don't know if they do any of that, but I would try not to get huge amounts of them from one identity or all at once if possible.

    Many clerks seem to be resistant to that approach. Don't be surprised if they say no. I should try getting them in a distant location from where I mail so I can make a fuss about it to try to find out if there is a specific reason they are resisting. If anyone else learns what's up, please say so here. Some people think the clerks are just incompetent. They do seem to know less than we do, but I do think there is more to it than that. Hopefully not.

    Agreed. Went into a PO near me just yesterday attempting to get the tracking 400's. The incompetent, head up her ass, looking lady (not to judge I'm sure shes a nice girl) had this smirkish look on her face the whole time and instantly referred me to her manager. He was supremely confident that I had no reason to take them home with me and that "there was never a line at this location so it shouldn't be too big of an inconvenience. Both employee's seemed to me to be in on something larger, as in they had some pretty scripted answers and not a whole lot of room to budge. I am developing a way to obtain tracking on pre-paid shipping at the moment, feel free to PM me for details or, hopefully, contributions.

    If? Of course they do, it would be a standard part of their order system, what reason would they to not keep track of this? If an employee stole a shipment of products to the warehouse and they didnt keep track of where all this goes then there would be alot of heads rolling.

    yes. IF i was shipping using this method and say they sent a pack of 500 straight to me and they were "blahblah 001" "blahblah 002" (which idk if thats how it is) and so on and a package i sent went straight to a fed could they know that they sent labels blahblah 001- blahblah 500 to me? could save someone a long time in jail. ill post here again when someone i know receives a pack of 500 labels (smallest size you can order off the website) and tell you all about the package and numbers used on the label. another thing... they have to have 1000's of packs of 500 on hand at a time so the only traceable way would be to have whatever machine makes and or wraps them put some kind of barcode on them and then when that barcode is scanned on dispatch it goes into a data base saying "labels blank through blank were sent to this address"

    I have never encountered any resistance from clerks but I can imagine it does occur.   When it does just try again with different clerks at different locations.  You can also change your tact by instead of asking for the stickers directly...ask "how can I add tracking to outgoing stamped mail that is dropped into a USPS BlueBox?" As long as dropping stamped mail is permissible there has to be a permissible way to add tracking.  There is nothing sketchy about asking your local postal clerk how this can be done.  If you find yourself dealing with a PO manager who tries to invalidate the premise of your inquiry by claiming there are never waiting lines at that location...you are just wasting your time.  There's no immediate remedy for that brand of ignorance.  Try to identify and then deal with experienced clerks.  This is not a matter that should ever require a manager being summoned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also...This idea of ordering them is a bad idea all around.  The point here is not only do they most definately have the capibility to keep track of what they send where...but in all likelihood, they do.  If just one pkg. was seized bearing a tracking label from this batch it would take Postal Inspectors 10 minutes to find out this label was one of a lot of  however many sent to this USPS account.  Even without a real name or address they have plenty to profile the sender. With some diligence they stand a very good chance to eventually identify you.   Aside from that it is never a good idea to use these sort of labels sequentially.(same goes for Express labels)

    Agree that it's a bad idea to get them mailed. I was out looking for some yesterday when I found what appears to be one of the old ones. It's got the red stripe down the side, and is still unused. Could I theoretically still use it, even if its the old one?

    If it is the old green kind, I think it would probably work fine. "Probably" is not usually good enough for us though. There is probably some rule against using them that is not always enforced. Might use it on a test package?

    its cheaper to print postage online, and more anonymous than going into store asking for a shit load of tracking labels.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anonymous, pay with ebay or pay pal; not through tor of course(vpn).  shouldn't be too hard to figure out -i'm not going to give a step by step guide though.  i would hope a vendor is mindful of customers by not reusing accounts.   hmm.. actually it's prob best most vendors don't print postage online -though when done right, its safe and practical.

    knowledge of a way to obtain an anonymous paypal account or prepaid card would be very valuable to alot of vendors. the ability to properly print postage online is insanely helpful. i wish there was a forum post of an old vendor or a helping hand telling vendors how to acquire such knowledge

    get a mostly local vpn, sign up for a usps account using that. set up a fake pay pal account with a registered gift card/cc with matching info.  don't print batch so all packages sent are not  connected and stay safe. get like 10 cards 10 accounts or more and rotate them to not develop a pattern. check out, pay with your fake personal pp account.

    Why would you go through all that trouble when they are getting sent to your own place anyway? They can still trace it to you via the delivery address so all of that is pointless.

    If you print online-postage you get tracking included and dont need the tracking stickers delivered to your address. You probably need false Identities for each credit card you use to open an account. That approach seems really sketchy to a dark-web noob like me.

    Buyers beware! If your vendor posts your mail via this method... I would cease all future transactions with them immediately.

    You are, again , creating a digital footprint in your customer's name. This violates the Vendor rule of not keeping a record of your customer's address.
    <br/>
    By printing prepaid shipping labels online, You are literally creating an address book of all your clients.

    doesnt really answer my question.
    <br/>
    i dont have a attitude to you for sharing wisdom, who would?
    <br/>
    but thats the only way to offer tracking on priority packages without going into the
    <br/>
    post office. so its either send and never TRULY know if they get it or not.
    <br/>
    or send that way. the addresses you use to print labels can be deleted.
    <br/>
    not that anything can ever truly be gone permanently.
    <br/>
    and if its honestly a problem why hasnt a post been made or an edit to the sellers guide saying
    <br/>
    not to ship this way? if what you saying is true and deleting it truly doesnt do anything
    <br/>
    i think that change should be made. or that post to be posted. (by an official)

    also an add to my last post.
    <br/>
    say i used 1 usps account. shipped 100's of orders never deleted addresses and my account was flagged and looked at.
    <br/>
    ALL they would have is a list of people receiving packages from fake addresses. sketchy but that
    <br/>
    doesnt always mean DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS. however if they caught ME, and managed to compromise my usps account
    <br/>
    (which is a stretch) then ALL they would have is a list of people i shipped to. not even how much.
    <br/>
    or i could delete it and then me as the seller would have done my part. (i guess..?) since the address is gone from me forever.

    It's not deleted from the USPS account is what he is saying.  You seem to be missing that point.  If LE makes a purchase, which they do, they then have all of the addresses that have been shipped to with that same account.  If LE intercepts a package, which can happen, then LE have all of the addresses that have been shipped to with that account.

    Well I can understand your frustration. And by all means, I dont want to imply that I have the answer to this question. I am stuck in the same boat as you are. All my orders have been placed on hold until I can resolve the issue. There, to me, is really no way to do it anonymously. The whole USPS prepaid online shipping was great at first but I stopped to think more into depth about what was really going on. I realized what was happening and immediately stopped. Its a good solution for the vendor but bad for the consumer. I know I sure as hell wouldnt want my information posted online.

    Your scenario may seem like a long shot indeed. But in my perspective, If LEO does get a hold of the account, maybe they placed an order? and you fulfilled it, then they could just backtrack the account and YES they will have all of those address... which may not seem like a big deal... BUT WHAT IF,   they flag those addresses? What happens if they flag the mail to those addresses to be examined? Guess what? The consumers now have LEO overwatching them. And sorry BUT being a vendor myself, I could not possibly put my customers in that type of danger, even if it is a slim to none chance of happening.

    getting customers addresses flagged is a selfish move but how about this scenario.

    you use the same card but make a different account every time. by the time it gets flagged

    I'm pretty sure the tracking numbers have a bar code and a lot number regardless of where you get them. Just get a shit load of them sent to different drops and if you ever have problems with a package getting seized never use another number from that set. This situation of yours has me bummed out, I'll continue to brainstorm and pm you any ideas I have.

    need a usps bar code expert.  I know businesses can generate their own unique barcode for shipping with tracking label, and you can do it online with stamps.com or a few other sites..  but what exactly does this bar code consist of?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i know it most likely consist of the location where the tracking was obtained -be it a private post office or ebay, and it also contains most of the address/delivery point...  okay..  okay..  so what if incorrect customer information was entered into the form to generate tracking and postage online, then you can customize that barcode with usps software possibly..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know there is software available to alter this specific bar code..  if you can make it scan as your delivery address, this would show nothing out of the ordinary to the mail carrier or mail sort scanners.  am i too high?  or does that sound like a fantastic idea?

    i lied.. i ordered a pack of priority flat rate boxes and they came with a barcode and a 13 digit number. but while i had time i went to the post office
    <br/>
    and grabbed the same kind of box and its the same number and the same barcode. so that leads me to believe you can order them off the website

    WRONG!  Here you are talking about the actual box itself. The 13 digit barcode you are talking about is just the number that correlates with the type of box it is! This has nothing to deal with tracking!  Tracking is a separate label that you place on the box. You can order the labels to be sent to you but what they are saying is that each of those labels are unique to a "batch" made... so they can track the original destination that these "label 400's" were sent to...  IE You order them to your house off of USPS... Package sent to customer gets intercepted... The feds can track the shipment back to your address; Not the fake one BUT THE REAL ONE.

    Lets chill out a bit Don, I feel like you're yelling. I don't think anybody is advocating for ordering shipping supplies (boxes, tracking stickers, or whatever) to your home address or an address that can be traced to you. Clearly that would be really stupid. I don't think primeroll is really stupid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems like the best options for getting tracking is to use the website with a visa gift card or get tracking stickers sent to a drop. One option will store customers info, one option will expose the vendor a little bit more. As a customer I'd like to think most vendors would choose the second option but if their stealth is good enough and they switch accounts frequently it shouldn't really matter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are probably other options I haven't considered but it'd probably be best to keep those out of the public eye. Hopefully some vendors who use USPS.com to print labels read this thread and rethink their sending methods.

    There are threads about tracking stickers and ignorant USPS employees often say things like "you cant get tracking unless you bring it to the counter or buy postage online". There may be a move by USPS to try to make that true? I don't think it really is though. Ask more post offices for tracking labels as "you want to use stamps and not have to stand in line" or "I wan't to use the drive up boxes" or ... You should be able to find a helpful clerk eventually. You might even be able to print postage online that does not have the address added yet? If so, it might not have the tracking barcode yet? If so, you could ask for stickers to go along with that, and then not use the online postage with them (if it is too traceable).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for online postage making a record of buyers, all mailings create USPS records of buyer's addresses. Using rolls/pads of tracking #'s, online postal accounts, buying postage for more than one package at the Kiosk, mailing in groups from the postal counter, and probably other steps can link the addresses together. The linking is a concern. I think saying doing any of those violates SR vendor rules is a stretch. It is good to think through this stuff though.

    I don't do either of those choices. Also, both of those link the buyers addresses. As a vendor, though, I must admit I will not choose any option exposing myself. LE want's to catch us more than personal-use buyers that are the most common buyers here. I believe domestically shipped packages getting confiscated/opened from a good vendor are usually busted for a bad address provided by the less worried and less experienced buyer. I guess I am just whining about the bad addresses, though. That is no excuse to endanger buyers with bad shipping practices.

    Yes, you can generate your own bar codes for USPS..it's called INTELLIGENT MAIL.  However...this discussion is a total waste of time for anyone who has the slightest concern for their safety.  FORGET creating your own bar codes.  FORGET about ordering Label #400 in bulk(or in any number).  FORGET about creating USPS online accounts and funding transactions with any type of debit/credit/gift card.  FORGET about printing your labels with electronically generated postage.  FORGET all this nonsense unless you want to potentially put yourself n the jackpot.   All these suggestions are ill advised and not nearly worth the possible exposure.  I'd rather risk losing track of a sent pkg.  (+ whatever it's value) by shipping without tracking ...than put myself in such a vulnerable position.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to minimize your risk to the absolute lowest degree when shipping  ....
    <br/>
    A.  NO electronically generated postage.  STAMPS ONLY!
    <br/>
    B.  NO electronically generated/printed labels with bar codes(only possible exception is if your are sending cash and use an accessible return address in case pkg. gets RTS)
    <br/>
    C.  No phony return addresses.  Make sure they are valid.
    <br/>
    D.  No handing off pkgs. to a Postal Employee..DROP BOXES ONLY!(and only boxes out of CCTV range)
    <br/>
    E.  Don't lick stamps and use gloves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The original question was how to ship anonymously with tracking.(I think)  The answer is still simple....ask for label# 400 from postal clerks.  There are appox. 32,000 USPS retail locations in the US.  Keep asking until you get them.  I know for a fact it can be done with no difficulty.   I've never encountered even the slightest hesitation on the  the 4 or 5 occasions I have asked for them.  By the way, I've yet to ask the same clerk twice or even use the same PO twice.  Obviously, this has not been everyone's experience but I know I am not the only one who gets them upon request.  The funny thing is I don't even really need them nor do I have much use for them.  I only began asking for them to see if I could get them.  In fact, just today I picked up a bunch.  I had some documents to send which I stuffed into a Flat Rate Priority envelope.  I had a few Priority stamps in my desk so I stuck one on.  Normally I would use a drop box and be done with it but instead I went to a PO I hadn't been to for quite a while.   I took it inside (very short line)and handed it over to a retail clerk who quickly processed the pkg and handed me a receipt.  I then asked the guy would he please peel off a few tracking labels for me so next time I can use a drop box??  "Oh sure, how many would you like??" was the reply.  "Just a few will be fine" I said.  He then proceeded to tear off about 30 stickers from his roll.  He folded them up neatly and placed them into one of those cellophane envelopes and handed them over.

    Shipping without tracking isn't an option for vendors, there are loads of scammers here. Unless they only work with people with high stats or require FE.

    I do think you're right about just getting them from the counter though, I'm not a vendor so I haven't tried getting tracking stickers from the post office. I was just here for some quality brainstorming but it seems like the general consensus is we over thought it. Maybe I'll go to the post office tomorrow and see if I can get some... for science.

     If you were buying anonymous prepaid visa cards and printing usps labels from clip-and-ship from a different card each time, a new account each time, and disguising it as a business or paypal transaction, I don't see how the PI would have any basis to inspect further given other interior packaging was correct. Do you really think USPS is looking for accts. only sending a few things (maybe even 1) and then flagging that recipient's address. Would it be better to do more shipments from a single acct? I guess I'm not following why it's a bad idea to print labels and make them look legit (on the customer's end)? This would maybe be a bigger problem for someone sending many packages a day?

    I'm a new SR vendor and the security aspects of delivery are indeed still quite problematic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been scanning the forum for details and this post is the most detailed I found so far, even though it still lacks a real guideline on how to properly ship with tracking. I also think that such information should be part of the seller's guide since it is crucial to ensure security for both vendors and customers and to maintain quality in the SR market.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd like to contribute to improve the quality of the delivery process, so I summarize what I've read so far and I add a couple of further questions for discussion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The most professional option for mailing with tracking seems to buy the least possible number of shipping labels online (USPS, stamps.com) using a temporary CC/PayPal accounts (why without using TOR browser though?). So, the best option would be to have each customer on a different CC/PayPal account so then if a package is caught there are no previous shipping records. Any idea?! What about "one-time use" numbers or virtual credit card number? Aren't there TOR services for that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then the process continues by printing your own label using blank internet shipping labels, and safely drop your package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll keep digging into the security of the delivery process and I'll post here if I have other solutions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Suggestions are appreciated in PM.

    Yeah while that certainly would be the safest way to go, not only would you have to manually create your printed labels and figure and attach correct postage for the package weight, size and distance, but you would have to use different return addresses for each package too and it still looks sketch cause who the hell uses stamps for packages anymore. This is crazy amounts of work you're suggesting just to gain an ounce more of security.

      Yes, you can generate your own bar codes for USPS..it's called INTELLIGENT MAIL.  However...this discussion is a total waste of time for anyone who has the slightest concern for their safety.  FORGET creating your own bar codes.  FORGET about ordering Label #400 in bulk(or in any number).  FORGET about creating USPS online accounts and funding transactions with any type of debit/credit/gift card.  FORGET about printing your labels with electronically generated postage.  FORGET all this nonsense unless you want to potentially put yourself n the jackpot.   All these suggestions are ill advised and not nearly worth the possible exposure.  I'd rather risk losing track of a sent pkg.  (+ whatever it's value) by shipping without tracking ...than put myself in such a vulnerable position.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If you want to minimize your risk to the absolute lowest degree when shipping  ....
      <br/>
      A.  NO electronically generated postage.  STAMPS ONLY!
      <br/>
      B.  NO electronically generated/printed labels with bar codes(only possible exception is if your are sending cash and use an accessible return address in case pkg. gets RTS)
      <br/>
      C.  No phony return addresses.  Make sure they are valid.
      <br/>
      D.  No handing off pkgs. to a Postal Employee..DROP BOXES ONLY!(and only boxes out of CCTV range)
      <br/>
      E.  Don't lick stamps and use gloves.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The original question was how to ship anonymously with tracking.(I think)  The answer is still simple....ask for label# 400 from postal clerks.  There are appox. 32,000 USPS retail locations in the US.  Keep asking until you get them.  I know for a fact it can be done with no difficulty.   I've never encountered even the slightest hesitation on the  the 4 or 5 occasions I have asked for them.  By the way, I've yet to ask the same clerk twice or even use the same PO twice.  Obviously, this has not been everyone's experience but I know I am not the only one who gets them upon request.  The funny thing is I don't even really need them nor do I have much use for them.  I only began asking for them to see if I could get them.  In fact, just today I picked up a bunch.  I had some documents to send which I stuffed into a Flat Rate Priority envelope.  I had a few Priority stamps in my desk so I stuck one on.  Normally I would use a drop box and be done with it but instead I went to a PO I hadn't been to for quite a while.   I took it inside (very short line)and handed it over to a retail clerk who quickly processed the pkg and handed me a receipt.  I then asked the guy would he please peel off a few tracking labels for me so next time I can use a drop box??  "Oh sure, how many would you like??" was the reply.  "Just a few will be fine" I said.  He then proceeded to tear off about 30 stickers from his roll.  He folded them up neatly and placed them into one of those cellophane envelopes and handed them over.

    Sounds like you might be able to do prepaid postage with a zip code and not have to type in an address for USPS - at least at a Kiosk. I'm not sure they don't scan in every address in the postal system though - even if we use stamps. I still don't think there is an SR rules violation (unless the Vendor has access to a list of addresses he shipped to? after buying postage online).

    Never use a kiosk, period. All the cameras around you in the PO, plus it snaps a pretty picture of you when it processes the order (yes, just like an atm machine. the camera is in plain view behind black square glass on the bottom of the screen, look for it). Say hi, honey.

    It's very strange that there are still people (let alone vendors) that actually believe this is a viable option. It's not, unless you want to purposely start the bomb timer on your very limited vending career.

    Ok I have kept my mouth shut long enough....... Tracking is just that TRACKING!!!!!! The new system CLEARLY exploits the shipping methods of almost all the domestic USA vendors. The tracking itself is now designed to make vendors MUCH MUCH MUCH more vulnerable to traditional LE surveillance and capture methods where they were useless before. We completely discontinued using tracking as it is not worth the risk now.

    Got around to going to the post office today, they wouldn't give me any tracking labels. Also told me that even if they did give me some it is against the rules to drop tracked mail in the blue boxes for "security reasons". Kiosk definitely had a camera on it too, I checked just to be sure. Even if you do get tracking labels from the desk how is that better than just sending the stuff at the desk? You still went into the post office and had your face on camera.

    Not totally factual . . .  not all kiosks have external cameras in the foyer of the Post Office, &amp; there are ways for the internal camera to not get a picture of you as well . . .  the bigger issue is finding a totally anonymous card that will work.

     If you print online-postage you get tracking included and dont need the tracking stickers delivered to your address. You probably need false Identities for each credit card you use to open an account. That approach seems really sketchy to a dark-web noob like me.

      Never use a kiosk, period. All the cameras around you in the PO, plus it snaps a pretty picture of you when it processes the order (yes, just like an atm machine. the camera is in plain view behind black square glass on the bottom of the screen, look for it). Say hi, honey.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It's very strange that there are still people (let alone vendors) that actually believe this is a viable option. It's not, unless you want to purposely start the bomb timer on your very limited vending career.

     Not totally factual . . .  not all kiosks have external cameras in the foyer of the Post Office, &amp; there are ways for the internal camera to not get a picture of you as well . . .  the bigger issue is finding a totally anonymous card that will work.

    Care to share (via PM, if you don't want it public)? I was under the impression that if you block the cam the order doesn't go through. And you're right, I've been in PO's without cams in the foyer. Still, though, you may as well be doing this at an atm machine. I'm sure there could be some interesting solutions, though. PM me if you have the time; I know you're busy.

       Sounds like you might be able to do prepaid postage with a zip code and not have to type in an address for USPS - at least at a Kiosk. I'm not sure they don't scan in every address in the postal system though - even if we use stamps.

     Got around to going to the post office today, they wouldn't give me any tracking labels. Also told me that even if they did give me some it is against the rules to drop tracked mail in the blue boxes for "security reasons". Kiosk definitely had a camera on it too, I checked just to be sure. Even if you do get tracking labels from the desk how is that better than just sending the stuff at the desk? You still went into the post office and had your face on camera.

    Yes.  The address on every package is automatically scanned.  If the machine can't read the address it pops up on a monitor in front of a postal worker and they read what it says and quickly type the correct address manually if they are able to read it.

    <br/>
    Well lets see,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The old way:
    <br/>
    1. Buy labels and labelmaker
    <br/>
    2. Copy over your addresses and print them out, not knowing if the buyer didnt screw up the address
    <br/>
    3. Weigh, measure, and calculate the cost for the distance each package has to travel
    <br/>
    4. Get out a bunch of stamps you have to constantly buy and figure out what combination you need not to overpay or underpay.
    <br/>
    5. Drop of a bunch of sketch stamped packages with similar labels/fonts/stamps in the blue boxes with a bunch of other mail thats all using electronic labels.
    <br/>
    6. Hope the postman doesnt notice that these packages are alike and decide to check out your return address.
    <br/>
    7. Hope your buyer doesnt screw you cause u cant get tracking stickers anonymously anymore.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And the new way:
    <br/>
    1. Buy labels and labelmaker
    <br/>
    2. Copy address info over and have USPS standardize it so you know the address is good
    <br/>
    3. Print
    <br/>
    4. Have tracking and legit looking label, drop as many as you want cause they'll all look the same.
    <br/>
    5. Show tracking to staff when scammers tries to say he didnt get it, get his stupid ass banned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like i said b4, theres an even better way than clicknship i found, but go eat ur donuts cause im not posting it on here.

    I'm closer to the "old way" but without most of your negatives about it. (I do wish USPS would check my addresses to see if they are legit. I wonder if there is a way to check that anonymously)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your "new way" sounds like "LE preferred way" to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my first impression though.
    <br/>
    I must admit to being biased against change, aka, new-fangled Ideas :-)
    <br/>
    I'll think on all the suggestions and concerns and appreciate any opinions given.

    I went to my local PO today and asked them for tracking labels. The worker had to ask his supervisor and the supervisor wasnt 100% positive but said that these 'might' work. He clearly said the green (I think those are the DCN?) ones are not used anymore and will not work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, he told me that I can get them online and I asked him if I could get a few so I can ship out the packages I have this week until the labels arrived and he gave me 20. Im sure if I just went to a few PO's with the same story I could get a few hundred no problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is a pic of the label's that they said 'might' work. Can anyone confirm if these are the right ones? Looking around on the internet this seems to be the '400' label you are speaking of.

    Also, is it 100% true the green DCN are no longer used?

    according the the manager of my non-main post office they will work fine but you cant drop them in blue boxes you have to
    <br/>
    take them to the office. i have CONFIRMED that you cant view any of the addresses you ship to when you print labels.
    <br/>
    once you print it out and throw away your half and click ok on that order youll never know their address again.
    <br/>
    probably saved into the system but so is everything even hand written. so... hopefully no more whining

    Well think I'ma gunna hava to call bullshit on that little story!  Not on the fact that you were told that story . . .  only that it IS a story!  We've used a few tracking (#400) on a few priority's that never saw a counter, &amp; know others that were dumped into blue boxes that never became security risks &amp; were scanned into the system &amp; worked fine.   One of the issues that they may be trying to get around is that they do sometimes check to see if the tracking &amp; the return address match up.  If it didn't get scanned into the system early on, the return &amp; the tracking won't match up close enough to the origin &amp; they may suspect foul play.  Whereas if it is brought to the counter all can be scanned &amp; checked &amp; all is good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We did have a few orders that the DCN's didn't get scanned into the system until it was across the country, &amp; 1 did raise flags &amp; a postal worker did call the customer to see if they were expecting a package from Calif since they thought it was sent from NJ with a Calif return . . .  it just never got scanned until it got to NJ.

     Well think I'ma gunna hava to call bullshit on that little story!  Not on the fact that you were told that story . . .  only that it IS a story!  We've used a few tracking (#400) on a few priority's that never saw a counter, &amp; know others that were dumped into blue boxes that never became security risks &amp; were scanned into the system &amp; worked fine.   One of the issues that they may be trying to get around is that they do sometimes check to see if the tracking &amp; the return address match up.  If it didn't get scanned into the system early on, the return &amp; the tracking won't match up close enough to the origin &amp; they may suspect foul play.  Whereas if it is brought to the counter all can be scanned &amp; checked &amp; all is good.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We did have a few orders that the DCN's didn't get scanned into the system until it was across the country, &amp; 1 did raise flags &amp; a postal worker did call the customer to see if they were expecting a package from Calif since they thought it was sent from NJ with a Calif return . . .  it just never got scanned until it got to NJ.

    all this is new. DCN doesnt exist anymore. and i sent one out with a label 400 on it and it never worked thats

    what caused me to look into it further. you WERE right back in the day but NOW your wrong. they will most likely ship
    <br/>
    it but if you ship FLAT RATE PRIORITY you cant use label 400s anymore when using blue boxes from what i was told and from what this next
    <br/>
    quote says you cant PERIOD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    go ahead and get yourself some label 400s if your PO actually gives them to you but if you want any sort of tracking
    <br/>
    figure out what services allow it with the blue boxes (not flat rate) if any. or you could use them how potato was told
    <br/>
    they can be used and slap a bad boy on a package and take it to the post office. YES they have the label 400s but you
    <br/>
    cant use them how you could in the very recent past.

    I currently agree with NCK and think Primroll and Potato' are spreading false Info.
    <br/>
    (that many USPS employees think is true). Maybe there is a change in policy at USPS that is just slowly being implemented? I'm not convinced. I don't think there is any security difference between tracked and untracked mail.
    <br/>
    There may be confusion caused by people asking if the old green "DCN" stickers can be used. They probably work to some extent as many postal folks probably scan any bar code they see by instinct, but, they are clearly NOT authorized for continued use. If you ask about using them, they will tell you NO. Of course you can use them if you take it to the counter so they can slap a new sticker over the top of it and give you a receipt with the new number on it.
    <br/>
    Why, some ask, is it better to get the stickers from the desk and then mail packages from the blue box? I call bullshit on this question! I don't believe anyone can't figure this out. It may be getting more risky to use stickers in blue boxes, however, when they only let a few people get the stickers on camera.

    Another thought:
    <br/>
    They may have to say tracking labels in the blue boxes don't work because the Post Office it is mailed from does not always scan the mail in the blue boxes before it gets sent to the next processing center. This would mean that you don't get the full service end-to-end tracking they advertise as free on priority mail etc.. So, they say you don't get tracking because they don't promise to scan it at it's origin. On it's way, though, it will be scanned a few times if all goes well. So, it may work fine for our needs and just not be good enough tracking for the USPS to call it "tracking".
    <br/>
    Also, the automated scanners may miss the tracking label if it is not positioned correctly and that could lead to it not getting picked up on tracking until later in it's journey? I think they go left of the address. Someone might chime in if they know for sure. However they do it at the counter is likely to be correct :-)

    I once had a postal person tell me I could have tracking labels to make my packages compliant with some postal code/policy/rule. I can't remember what exactly she said. She gave me lots of white stickers that were not #400's and did not come with the extra strip with a tracking number for the sender to keep. She assured me I would NOT get tracking with these stickers (that said "tracking" in big letters on them). She seemed to think using these tracking-type bar codes could help our packages move more quickly through the system as the item would not need to wait for a USPS employee to have time to add a barcode to the package.
    <br/>
    If we figure out how to ask for stickers to make our packages "compliant with USPS rule x" or whatever, we may solve the difficulty with getting the stickers. I do like those little extra strips though, lol.

    well if your correct its not the first time the postal employees are ignorant. if im correct then its one of the first times they know what they are talking about.

    however if someone figures out how to ask for labels to where they will give them up ill be more than happy to send someone a book or something to test them out

    You can ship out priority flat rate  with a label 400 sticker on it with NO PROBLEM. Notice how i did not say BOXES. Boxes have to go to the lobby mail box drop or at the counter if over 13 ounces. Envelopes are fine if just dropping in the blue boxes.

    I have been talking about boxes that are clearly under 13 Ozs.
    <br/>
    ? I don't think the quote above is intended to say I have to take them to the "lobby mailbox drop" (can't use outdoor blue boxes)?
    <br/>
    I will say most blue boxes can only accept the "small" and one of the two optional "Medium" flat-rate-size boxes. Sadly the Medium that fits is also the heavier and larger medium box. It seems the lighter "Medium" box does need to go to the camera-rich lobby due to it's shape.

    share because theres alot of vendors in this thread that would LOVE to do it your way
    <br/>
    where everyone is safe it they had a little know how.
    <br/>
    i personally dont really care how it gets done i just need it done.
    <br/>
    (by that i mean obtaining label 400s and testing all of it to see if it can be done
    <br/>
    and if so adding that to the list of shipping methods that work.)

    I get what Donald' is saying and think he said it well.
    <br/>
    Prime, you seem to want this to be all laid out for LE to spoon up easily.  We already explained in detail how to get enough tracking to know if the package went to the address. You keep suggesting it will not work. What else can we do, lol.
    <br/>
    It has been months since I needed to track a package, So, I guess I can't be sure my tracking is working. If you don't have the sticker, though, buyers know you can't prove you mailed it. Harsh, no refund style policies to avoid the need to have tracking don't seem like a good way to get a new vendor account off the ground. People have explained various ways to get the stickers, so, I would keep at it and I think you will get them. If we are doomed to go without tracking as you suggest, you will certainly deserve to say you "told me so" later.

      Well think I'ma gunna hava to call bullshit on that little story!  Not on the fact that you were told that story . . .  only that it IS a story!  We've used a few tracking (#400) on a few priority's that never saw a counter, &amp; know others that were dumped into blue boxes that never became security risks &amp; were scanned into the system &amp; worked fine.   One of the issues that they may be trying to get around is that they do sometimes check to see if the tracking &amp; the return address match up.  If it didn't get scanned into the system early on, the return &amp; the tracking won't match up close enough to the origin &amp; they may suspect foul play.  Whereas if it is brought to the counter all can be scanned &amp; checked &amp; all is good.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We did have a few orders that the DCN's didn't get scanned into the system until it was across the country, &amp; 1 did raise flags &amp; a postal worker did call the customer to see if they were expecting a package from Calif since they thought it was sent from NJ with a Calif return . . .  it just never got scanned until it got to NJ.

     your pretty out of date sir, do some research.
     <br/>
     all this is new. DCN doesnt exist anymore. and i sent one out with a label 400 on it and it never worked thats
     <br/>
     what caused me to look into it further. you WERE right back in the day but NOW your wrong. they will most likely ship
     <br/>
     it but if you ship FLAT RATE PRIORITY you cant use label 400s anymore when using blue boxes from what i was told and from what this next
     <br/>
     quote says you cant PERIOD.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     go ahead and get yourself some label 400s if your PO actually gives them to you but if you want any sort of tracking
     <br/>
     figure out what services allow it with the blue boxes (not flat rate) if any. or you could use them how potato was told
     <br/>
     they can be used and slap a bad boy on a package and take it to the post office. YES they have the label 400s but you
     <br/>
     cant use them how you could in the very recent past.

    i dont understand how seeing an issue, going myself to the post office, asking a question,
    <br/>
    the returning here with what ive been told is a bad way to go about things.
    <br/>
    im assuming you do what every 11 year old does and just google it?
    <br/>
    nice... hope that works for you.
    <br/>
    what happens when you dont get an answer?
    <br/>
    and its irrelevant if they honor them for 6 months vendors cant get use
    <br/>
    to DCN since its non existant (or it will be soon). so lets find a real solution together instead of wasting
    <br/>
    peoples time by posting things like you just did.

    i sent that package with a label 400 on it with a sample order.

    i didnt do it wisely so im not using the ones i have anymore.

    anyway they received it perfectly fine i just could never track it.

    why do you supposed that happened?

    maybe you could go to your post office and ask about it?

    I think USPS tracking is known to be unreliable. The sticker may have caught on a machine or something and came off. Maybe it was in a bad spot on the box? Hard to tell for sure from my armchair. Tracking might work now, it can be very slow sometimes. Check the box, is the sticker there, was another one added? If you sent it to a place that you never intend to send contraband, you might have the receiver ask their postal delivery person for their thoughts.

    Ok, after reading this, how about a little helpful information. more than 1/2 my family works for the postoffice (US) and I can tell you from experience that the postal employees don't know SHIT! They will tell you anything just to get you out the door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, helpful information you dont know and they will not tell you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    #1) If and when you go to the post office, look like anyone else off the street. Walk in looking like a hippy, drug user, or bum and they will not be helpful.
    <br/>
    #2) Know what you are asking for, they are not going to take the time to look for you or help you find what you need.
    <br/>
    #3) Take something to mail, dont just walk in and ask for crap that they give away for packaging. They will be less likely to help you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now for the fun part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A) You can still put a tracking label and stamps on the package and drop it in the blue box.
    <br/>
    B) You can still get the tracking labels at the post office
    <br/>
    C) Dont take shit from them, be nice, polite, and assertive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I went into the post office and picked up a roll of USPS tracking labels and here is how it went.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Me: I need to mail these three letters.
    <br/>
    PO: It will be $X.XX is there anything else I can get you?
    <br/>
    Me: Yes, I need 2 sheets of $1 stamps, a roll of forever stamps, and a roll of label 400
    <br/>
    PO: I dont know what label 400 is can you describe it?
    <br/>
    Me: it is the new USPS tracking label that replaced the green DCN labels, they are white and come in a roll of 100
    <br/>
    PO: We dont have them, you will have to order them from the website.
    <br/>
    Me: That is odd, the website says that you can get all your postal needs at the post office or on the website, I assumed you would have them. Can you check please?
    <br/>
    PO: (After digging through a couple of boxes opens a whole case of them) and says "Oh, I think I found them. Is this it?"
    <br/>
    Me: Yep, that is it. I just need one roll.
    <br/>
    PO: hands me the roll and says "We got those in several months ago and no one knew what they were for. That will be $XX.XX for the stamps"
    <br/>
    Me: Handing the lady cash asking "They did not give you a memo or a display to put them in?"
    <br/>
    PO: ringing me up "Nope, this is the US post office. One of the things we suck as  is communications"
    <br/>
    Me and the PO laugh and I happily walk out the door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first post office I went to the guy was rude, there was a line and he seemed to be having a bad day. The upshot of the above is that from now on I can honestly say "I got them last time, the nice lady found a whole box of them behind the counter. Would you mind taking a look please?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, you can still get the DNC labels and business as usual. You just have to know what to ask for and be nice and polite no matter how rude they are to you.

    Perhaps this is a foolish question, but I was wondering if there are any significant differences in usage between the label 400 and the old DCN sticker? That is, do you simply attach the label 400 to the package and send it off, and track using the number on the USPS site?

    I don't know of a difference in the details of using the old stickers vs new.
    <br/>
    I do think vendors should have tracking on all their packages, however, I also think it may be best to avoid tracking any packages online unless you really need to. I think it can be bad for the address it is going to and can ruin your ability to say "I was not expecting this package". Tracking from Tor is especially sketchy. Using a 3rd-party tracking service may help, still risky though. They can easily pass your IP address to USPS when they request the tracking info from there. I like to wait until it is at least a week late.

    What I've done is just go to about 3 or 4 different Post Offices and ask them for as many tracking labels as they are willing to give me ("I'm an ebay seller and do a lot of shipping from home"). The first post office just gave me about 6, the second one gave me about 25, then the third gave me a whole book (which I think is 50 or 100, didn't really check). I only ask for them when I go there to buy stamps and stuff so it doesn't look too suspicious. As long as you don't go in to the same Post Office day after day asking for tracking labels it shouldn't be too obvious. They use hundreds of thousands if not millions of them a day over the US, the best they can probably do is track it back to the zip code it came from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But you can order them by the 500 (up to 2000) online. The best way is to create a false name account (with a PO Box that isn't in your name or whatever), and have it delivered there and pay with a vanilla visa or something.

    so the tracking labels do work when packages are placed in the blue boxes? There was a lot of back and forth in this thread so i just wanted to make sure. Also, how much extra postage do you have to add?

     Ok, after reading this, how about a little helpful information. more than 1/2 my family works for the postoffice (US) and I can tell you from experience that the postal employees don't know SHIT! They will tell you anything just to get you out the door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, helpful information you dont know and they will not tell you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     #1) If and when you go to the post office, look like anyone else off the street. Walk in looking like a hippy, drug user, or bum and they will not be helpful.
     <br/>
     #2) Know what you are asking for, they are not going to take the time to look for you or help you find what you need.
     <br/>
     #3) Take something to mail, dont just walk in and ask for crap that they give away for packaging. They will be less likely to help you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now for the fun part.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A) You can still put a tracking label and stamps on the package and drop it in the blue box.
     <br/>
     B) You can still get the tracking labels at the post office
     <br/>
     C) Dont take shit from them, be nice, polite, and assertive.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, I went into the post office and picked up a roll of USPS tracking labels and here is how it went.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Me: I need to mail these three letters.
     <br/>
     PO: It will be $X.XX is there anything else I can get you?
     <br/>
     Me: Yes, I need 2 sheets of $1 stamps, a roll of forever stamps, and a roll of label 400
     <br/>
     PO: I dont know what label 400 is can you describe it?
     <br/>
     Me: it is the new USPS tracking label that replaced the green DCN labels, they are white and come in a roll of 100
     <br/>
     PO: We dont have them, you will have to order them from the website.
     <br/>
     Me: That is odd, the website says that you can get all your postal needs at the post office or on the website, I assumed you would have them. Can you check please?
     <br/>
     PO: (After digging through a couple of boxes opens a whole case of them) and says "Oh, I think I found them. Is this it?"
     <br/>
     Me: Yep, that is it. I just need one roll.
     <br/>
     PO: hands me the roll and says "We got those in several months ago and no one knew what they were for. That will be $XX.XX for the stamps"
     <br/>
     Me: Handing the lady cash asking "They did not give you a memo or a display to put them in?"
     <br/>
     PO: ringing me up "Nope, this is the US post office. One of the things we suck as  is communications"
     <br/>
     Me and the PO laugh and I happily walk out the door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The first post office I went to the guy was rude, there was a line and he seemed to be having a bad day. The upshot of the above is that from now on I can honestly say "I got them last time, the nice lady found a whole box of them behind the counter. Would you mind taking a look please?"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, you can still get the DNC labels and business as usual. You just have to know what to ask for and be nice and polite no matter how rude they are to you.

    Just tried this, the lady told me that 1) I can't buy $5.80 stamps for small flat rate boxes and 2) there is no way to get tracking for small flat rate boxes unless you hand them to a person.  I pointed out I could buy Priority stamps online, but they were $5.60 and I didn't want my packages kicked back, AND that on the website it said I could get rolls of tracking FREE FOR PRIORITY at the post office, and I also wanted to buy $5.80 priority stamps.  "Well the website must need to be updated."  Went around in circles a while, I ultimately paid and left with no stamps or tracking numbers.  Guess I'll try a different PO.

    There are no $5.80 stamps. You buy 5.60s and 0.20s or other combinations to get what you need. Asking the staff to figure out what stamps you need can be a memorable and time-consuming experience for the staff - if they are stupid or low on blood-sugar or stoned ;-) or ... It is best to know exactly what you want and be prepared for the "sticker shock" if buying a lot of big stamps. Also, many post offices don't seem to stock the big stamps.

    According to one guy, you can go to the machines in the lobby and get $5.80 stamps so that could be an option with a prepay CC or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PO #3 had stamps for me (I was going to buy the $5.60 and $0.20 or whatever I needed) and asked for form 400 tracking labels in a roll to go with the stamps.  The lady told me she couldn't give them out.  I pointed out USPS website said I could get those online or at the post office, and here I am at the post office.  "I'm sorry, my supervisor told us to not give these out to customers."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So there it is... supervisor explicitly said to not hand those out to customers.  Bah.  Fuck it, I've got some other ideas.

    I've tried lots of different methods.  I still have about 50 of the green DCN's but I stopped using them months ago.   When I stopped using the DCN's, I went to the post office and tried to get some 400's.  In one week I visited every post office within 20 miles of my location and had about 12 of the new 400's.  It was not a very efficient way to obtain them.

    Sorry, I should have said that I dont use Priority Flat rate boxes. Because I want to put stamps on the box and a tracking label and not have to dick with the people or systems at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I order boxes from a shipping supplier along with packing tape, Address labels, and bubble wrap for packaging. If I tried to use those flat rate boxes I would have to clean out all the local post offices of boxes and it would cost my customers twice as much in shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do use the flat rate from time to time for large orders but not for my day to day.

    Good luck Mr. Heroin/Coke distributor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I honestly don't think the postal service is intelligent enough to implement something like this, knowing that it would indirectly negatively affect the business on SR (for hard drugs).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors may eventually just have to fall back on buyer feedback to decide who to sell/not sell to. And buyers can build feedback with small amounts of cheap substances (i.e. 1g/8th of marijuana/shrooms/LSD or RCs). DPR has given us a system to work with here. We don't necessarily NEED tracking - it's a luxury that simply makes things easier. But as anyone can see SR is stronger than ever right now. This will not affect anything. Part of this lifestyle is its dynamic nature - the successful individuals are the best problem solvers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way, I agree with the other individual who said it's too easy to profile you when you are going into post offices for tracking labels. And you should certainly not be going to POs within your zip code; preferably, it should be one a few zip codes away at least.  Not to mention, you should not look like you when you walk in, IF you want to do it. The best way to deal with this, it seems, is to get a secure drop (much easier said than done, as we all know) and ship the labels there. But even then, if a pack gets grabbed, you better believe that drop is compromised. So just don't ever get a pack seized, or have a secure drop with people who will not speak about you (or are ignorant to the fact you sent anything there). Or, as I said before, simply deal with your customers how you would in real life. They need to be spoken for and confirmed by others who have done transactions with them. Stats will become much more important, and I believe buyer feedback (by vendors) should be implemented for further confirmation of a buyer's trustworthiness.

    I find it so weird that none of you can get these. I think I've only ever been turned down once. I've gotten them from multiple PO's around me and I would only buy like 10 stamps and they'd give me a 100 labels and just say, sorry we can't give you the whole thing, come back when you need more. I don't know what I'm doing that makes them give em to me but yeah, no problems on my end.

     I find it so weird that none of you can get these. I think I've only ever been turned down once. I've gotten them from multiple PO's around me and I would only buy like 10 stamps and they'd give me a 100 labels and just say, sorry we can't give you the whole thing, come back when you need more. I don't know what I'm doing that makes them give em to me but yeah, no problems on my end.

    Hey guys just wanted to chime in on this topic. I'm not a vendor but I went to the PO to see how easy it would be to get the tracking stickers. I know the lady that works there that has helped me alot before. I asked her a roundabout way if there was some way that I could track my shipments without having to come into the PO cause my job wouldn't allow that. She told me to do it online and she also offered that they can have someone come out to my business(lie) to talk to me about different options and they can also arrange for pick up. I tried to push her to get me the stickers by asking again if there wasn't an easier way and she said no not that she's aware of. So that's my experience about it. I got the feeling from her that tracking stickers even if available now won't be much longer.

    I would not buy a 400 label tracker from someone I didn't know and anonymously over the internet, seems like something that would be really easy to flag, and would put US vendors in danger. We already know that they have mail covers. One more thing that can put you on the radar of LE. If I were a vendor, I would much rather not track or if tracking is important do it as anonymous as possible.

    What do you mean by easy to flag? Do you mean have LE sell these to vendors and then snag the packages once the tracking shows up in the system? I suppose that is a possibility but one that is easily remedied. Only buy from trusted vendors. I may have only been around a month or so as a vendor but I have a perfect track record so far. If you are not comfortable buying from me yet, check me out again in a few months.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do not see how this puts vendors in danger at all aside from them using an address to receive them. If anything it would be the buyer in the scenario above. Using label 400s is without a doubt the most anonymous way to send a tracked package now. Using click to ship or any other similar online service (which is far too common among vendors) is much more risky for buyers. It links the buyers address with god knows how many other buyers, one bad pack job or leak in a seal and LE now has a list of addresses of other buyers. The worst part about this scenario is you may not even know that your address is now being watched more closely. How would you? You never had a pack going missing but you might as well have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as not using tracking at all it really just is not an option. In a perfect world it would all be so much simpler. Unfortunately us humans are far from perfect, if truth be told most are actually terrible people. You just dont realize until you start vending here on the road just how many scammers there are out there. Without tracking you have no proof you even sent anything. There are actually buyers who still try to claim their pack was never received EVEN WITH TRACKING!!!! With out tracking the number of reships would be through the roof.

    You can go trackingless if you change your buying policy to no refund/reship and require buyers to have certain stats to order. If you do not scam people, then you will be in the clear of scammers yourself with enough feedback of good business.

    Sure I guess changing your buying policy to exclude newbs is one way to do cut back on the number of people claiming unreceived orders, but for new vendors this would be a terrible business decision.  I have been vending for just over 6 weeks and have sent out a total of 39 orders. 19 of these were from accounts with less than 5 transaction and $500 spent (typical minimum stats requirement). I use tracking on all orders and have only had two issues with what most people would consider newbs. The first was a simple auto-finalize and the second was a competing vendor trying to ruin my feedback score.  If I had decided to have a minimum stats requirement I would have missed out on almost half of my sales and still would not even qualify for my bond refund yet. I would definitely rather charge (or pay when item has free shipping) an extra $1.40 for shipping and be able to deal with all buyers regardless of their stats.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for a no refund/reship policy that also sounds like a terrible idea. I know that I personally would never order from a vendor with that policy. Shit happens, USPS fucks up and loses mail all the time. There are legitimate reasons for refunds/reships. Excluding them completely, especially when you dont even use tracking makes it way to easy for a vendor to start scamming. I am not at all implying you would ever do that so please do not take this the wrong way. I am speaking about the policy in general.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dont understand the logic behind the second part of your post. How does not scamming others prevent someone from scamming you? Believe me I wish it worked like that but unfortunately in my experience that is just not the world we live in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, I saw a lot of people were having trouble getting these and I figured out a way to get a decent amount so I thought the community would appreciate it if I started offering these.

    Some Post offices now have tracking available in small tablet form with 2 tags &amp; their 2nd confirmation # below the label on each tablet page.  This should be widespread by the end of the year, so when you purchase priority stamps you can ask for tracking &amp; they'll start handing out these 3"x5" little sets of tracking labels.  So that's probably why they are trying to hang on to the rolls.

    Doesnt seem too anonymous tbh. If i am understanding right, you do the ordering for the shipping materials at your place of work. If a shipment is intercepted it is traceable to your job, where you will be one of the first people they talk to.

    Be sure the postage is correct. 5.60 is no longer enough for small boxes, at least (5.80 now). Don't go over 13 OZs if dropping in a blue box and don't tape over the stamps.

    Thanks for the heads-up. The $5.60 is sufficient for flat-rate envelopes, right? Just want to make sure I've got everything I need in order to ship properly. Thanks, everyone.

    I think anonymous visas are getting harder to get. You also need an address to mail it to. Assuming you get them, they are sequentially numbered (sort of) and if USPS knows what roll they sent you, all your labeled packages are linked if any one of them gets opened, USPS may have a list of all the addresses U mailed to and a place they sent the labels to. Online postage comes with tracking and is cheaper but has similar concerns. If there is a good way to overcome these problems, it might not be a good idea to mention it here?

    These forums are full of a lot of conjecture &amp; theories, but my question is;  does anyone actually have proof of USPS being able to do anything with a tracking # other than saying where it has been?  In other words, has there been any proof that when a "flagged" tracking # was scanned it could get pulled out of the system, do they even have built into their system a way of stopping the process so they can find the package or envelope on the processing line &amp; pull it?  Or is all of these type discussions a lot of hyperbole?!?

    The only time I have heard of any of this was with an issue in the UK, not with USPS tracking.  I'm not sure the tracking software program is written to be robust enough to search it's databanks for potential "offenders" &amp; be able to "spit them out" of the system.  I could be very wrong, but I have yet to hear anything that would lead me to believe their system works that way.   They are in the business of trying to send as much mail &amp; parcels as possible, not to see how many they can kick out!!!  Their jobs will last longer with the MORE they send through, not less, &amp; they are not the little arm of the law that is involved with the war on drugs.

    You're a vendor, get a roll of 400's and use one to mail some loose weed to some random house, write "cannabuyer" on the label so it gets flagged to all hell, then start sending out empty boxes using the same roll and see if it gets to its loc.

     True too a point . . .  but USPS is the red headed step child looking for xmas money compared to all the other agencies like the Defense, along with all the other alphebet soup agencies . . .  they are all funded, but the USPS tries to fund itself &amp; doesn't have the deep pockets of all the others that are funded by the gov.

     True too a point . . .  but USPS is the red headed step child looking for xmas money compared to all the other agencies like the Defense, along with all the other alphebet soup agencies . . .  they are all funded, but the USPS tries to fund itself &amp; doesn't have the deep pockets of all the others that are funded by the gov.

    I would not feel safe because the USPS is having budget shortages on their daily shipping needs. I agree with NCK that we are guessing and not going on facts most of the time. That said, I assume (without facts) that the US Gov't does fund the part of the USPS we are concerned about pretty well. I'd guess a better funded agency like Homeland Security has inserted themselves (or their equipment and policies) into every sorting facility or "hub" such that all mail passes through their "watchful gaze". Of course there is a hell of a lot of mail passing by and it is probaly more of a "watchful glaze". I hope I am mistaken about the funding of the mail "security department" being much higher than the rest of the USPS, but I think we should all assume the worst until we have facts to the contrary.
