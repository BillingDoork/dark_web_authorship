    Ok so I am just trying to gauge what is going on from vendors in the US that have been here awhile. Last week I dropped orders from weekend in drop box before their last pick up time. The delivery confirmation showed it throughout its journey and one made it by wed and the other thursday. This week I dropped 2 packages early monday at the exact same drop and the delivery confirmation has not shown anything since it departed the first sort facility at 1am on monday morning, this definitely was not the case last time and I am wondering if something might be happening that would be the reason it did not show anything else after 1am on July 31st (yes, technically that was Tuesday, but it was dropped on Monday).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would just like to figure out if something happened to my orders by getting feedback to what has happened with the delivery confirmation alerts from people who have had packages taken in the US. Mainly because I would like to get out replacement packages asap, but also just so I know. Packaging was not terrible, typed, printed labels, etc. Did nothing different.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe it's nothing, but something just doesn't seem right. Either way I'd like to get some feedback on this.
