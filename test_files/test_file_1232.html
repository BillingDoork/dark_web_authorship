    Both are pretty safe as long as the vendor's stealth is good. I've had a couple large orders from both countries. I am personally more comfortable with ordering from Canada. My last decent sized pack was from Germany had been opened, most likely by customs, but they couldn't find the product because the stealth was on point

    Canada all the way! First of all, its not overseas. Second, Canada is too cute and innocent. Third, (I'm not positive on this; its just how I feel) Germany is kind of like a mini Netherlands as far as drugs and stuff. Look at how much stuff is coming from Germany lately. Fourth Canada is much closer. They're like our little hat...ok not so little...its a top hat, so what?

    I'm a Canuck, and have had coke and benzos successfully come from U.S. to Canada. No large orders though, just personal use.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the poster asking about Cartel de Norte. I've never used them, but if you are unsure search the forums and read any threads for intel... Or just ask Jack as he always seems to be up to date about everything related to SR. (Always impressed with his knowledge!)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to see CBSA in action (Canada Customs) there is a show called Border Security that has some episodes that show outgoing mail processes.

    Good luck with any orders OP!
