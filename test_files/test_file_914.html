    Not sure where to put this, but I wasn't going to post it in the newbies forum.. Anyway, I made my first order from the silk road 9 days ago. Ordered 1 gram of mdma. Well about an hour ago, what looked like two door to door salesmen knocked on my door in normal civilian clothes so I answered. The guy said "are you Cory?" So I said yep thinking nothing of it. He pulls out his badge and says hes with the county task force and he wants to talk to me about some packages I've ordered in the mail. So instantly I knew I was hit. He then goes on to ask what I ordered. I told him I had ordered 1 gram of mdma for personal use. He tells me it was methamphetamine. So I'm guessing either mdma shows up as meth in their tests or the vendor sent me meth. Well he asked who sent it. Thats when I said I'm not comfortable talking about it until I have a lawyer. So he says hes going to give me two days to think about it and then hes coming back with papers. And in cop talk that basically means he wamts me to turn snitch because he assumes I know who sent it to me. So basically I'm going to jail when he comes back. Luckily I only ordered a gram.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So basically, to any silk road newbies, I guess never use your real name when you order. Or at least be more careful than I was. Not sure what all I did wrong but using my name was definitely a mistake..

    WHY would you admit to ordering it and tell them exactly what you ordered?!?!?!  Have you read anything on these forums?  You NEVER admit to it and you NEVER answer questions like that -- you talk to a lawyer!

    It has the methamphetamine backbone. In the shitty field test they do, it will test as methamphetamine. You'll have to prove it isn't meth by having them send it for GC/MS or more specific testing. Doesn't matter though because MDMA is schedule 1.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should have never, ever, ever admitted it was yours.

    When they come back, don't say a fucking word. Talk to your parents, tell them everything, get a lawyer, and do not say a fucking word when they come back. I'm assuming you're very young by your post. Don't let this fuck up your life.

    Well thing is I live with my dad and its his house. I don't want him getting heat for what I ordered. And had I denied they would have gotten him involved. I'd rather take my charge then putting pressure on my dad. Since it was only a gram I'll take time served and get it over with.

    Are you in the US?  If you don't want to say what county you're in, can you say the state, or at least are you in a city or rural area?  Was the shipment USPS mail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's bizarre they would be able to detect only one gram unless they had a dog sniffing every package.  Did you use a known good vendor?  Almost seems like you ordered from LEO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As others have said, you blew it by admitting to anything.  You say NOTHING.  All you say is "I have no idea what you're talking about" and then ask him to leave.  Don't engage in conversation, shut up and ask him to leave.  Your dad will not get in trouble even if you lie because he didn't do anything.  They can't prosecute him for something you did.  Much better to keep your mouth shut and get in trouble with your dad than get in trouble with LE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now they are probably going to threaten you with a federal felony (even if it's an empty threat) for using US mail to receive drugs to try to make you ID the vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should get a lawyer now, and don't talk to the cops until then.  Are you a minor?  If you're a minor the cops probably shouldn't have asked you questions outside the presence of your dad.  Maybe a lawyer could get your statement to the cops thrown out, and that is their only evidence.  If you're a minor.

    Yeah, you fucked up. The police showing up at your door is scary. If you aren't ready than don't fucking order. You think what people on here are saying about a clean house is a joke? If you open the door to these fuckers, they can do whatever they want. Maybe they "smell weed" and bang probable cause for a warrant and they are tearing your house apart. That is if you don't bend over like this guy and confess immediately... in which case I don't see how they didn't search your house, consider yourself lucky as shit because what wiggum said might work with the right lawyer.

    you have 2 days to clean up evidence, message me and I'll help you out with wiping stuff clean, I'm paranoid a lot of the time from solid-black tinted window cars and sheriff officers constantly driving by my house due to a missing shipment which was marked delivered, and I've received a police letter from an HIDTA group before. I know how it is. Send me a PM if you need anything, I can help.

    Agree. When I was just young and just starting out I had someone snitch out my place and four undercover came knocking on my door. After opening the door they informed me why they were there and if they could come in and talk about it &gt; "lets go inside so we don't make a scene out here for your neighbors".  I started to stutter that I was uncomfortable with that and one cop says "come on I already smell the marijuana" lol. Next thing I know they are in the house and while starting to proceed around one says "you don't mind if we just clear this up and look around quick do you". Well I was young/dumb but I knew I didn't shit where I slept at least that week and said go ahead. Two cops stayed on me and the other two went walking around. I don't think they opened any drawers or anything but they did look into every room. After 15-20mins of finding nothing sitting in open site, the two came back to where we were by the front door and said "thanks" and walked out. Scared the shit out of me at the time how fast it all went down once I opened the door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Moral of the story: don't have shit in the house where you sleep or at the very least have only personnel amounts hidden well, don't open the door or maybe go out the backdoor around to the front to talk but leave doors locked, don't consent to search if they somehow push there way in if you do mistakenly open the door, deny any knowledge of anything they are saying.

    This was a knock and talk, not a controlled delivery. If it was a controlled delivery, they would have had a package (which you didn't mention them having), plus a warrant, which they could/would use to enter the house. They left because they didn't have a warrant. That means they really didn't have any evidence on you and by denying it you stood a good chance of not getting prosecuted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think they do knock and talks because half the people get scared and admit it. It's a good way of nailing people when they have no other evidence on them, but what they really want is the sender. In this case, that's not possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You're right though, it's a small amount. If your state has drug court / drug diversion, you'll probably get that or probation instead of jail time.

    Dude that sucks but the only thing that can possibly save you right now is if you live in the usa and if you are a minor you have a good chance at getting off because they cannot question a minor without his parent/guardian or his lawyer and you had neither present... Other then that you might be screwed because you admitted guilt and it's pretty much case closed.. Clean up if you have shit around get a lawyer and keep your mouth shut from here on out!!

     I told him I had ordered 1 gram of mdma for personal use. He tells me it was methamphetamine. So I'm guessing either mdma shows up as meth in their tests or the vendor sent me meth. Well he asked who sent it. Thats when I said I'm not comfortable talking about it until I have a lawyer. So he says hes going to give me two days to think about it and then hes coming back with papers. And in cop talk that basically means he wamts me to turn snitch because he assumes I know who sent it to me. So basically I'm going to jail when he comes back. Luckily I only ordered a gram.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So basically, to any silk road newbies, I guess never use your real name when you order. Or at least be more careful than I was. Not sure what all I did wrong but using my name was definitely a mistake..

    This is literally what these task force guys do all day everyday. Not sure what "intel" they would be gathering... Anyway that's how they operate, try to scare the shit out of you, tell you you're going to get raped, but maybe you can help yourself. Then kick you lose to think about your freedom. That's how people get caught. Snitches. He had one gram, they want the guy with 1000.

    G'day Corey,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    See mate this was your mistake you should have declared to customs
    <br/>
    that you were importing 1 gram of MDMA from the world wide web.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So just for next time you order drugs make sure to alert customs that
    <br/>
    your expecting a package that contains MDMA and what country it
    <br/>
    comes from.  This will prevent them boys from knocking on your door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All the best to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.s Keep reading the forums
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace

    There's no way it's real. In the US, it would be US Postal Inspectors that do the delivery. They would deliver it not just ask your name. And then they would bust you near immediately after you took possession. They would not just ask who you are and say they're with the "county task force". You could then just say You never ordered anything and that's it.

    if it is real, the OP is obviously getting himself in to trouble through his lack of tact.. (as a philosopher once said.. the universe is just, and no man has more than he deserves..) but as it stands, it looks like BS. and people/ the OP might say, well what intel do i have to gather? well initially it was a warning to everybody to NOT use your real name, but as most vendors say, you BETTER use your real name. therefore the new guys come along and see this scary warning to not use your real name, then all the best vendors demand that you DO use your real name, and from then on you're too scared to order.. its all a scare tactic with these bullshit posts. it's not so much about gathering intel, it's about the vibes that they put out into the community

    In the event it's all true, and stranger shit has happened, let natural selection take care of it.

    Was the Vendor name mentioned? - I still have this 5% theory, that it could very well be true!  :o

    If so, the vendor was LE, and you could do us all a favor by outing him. Also what kind of 'friend' would out you for buying him drugs??

    You can't blame us for being cavalier about this, that is, if it is true.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sounds like the 'task force' wasn't up to task. You'd be in a holding cell by now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's some guy, or group of people, posting ridiculous shit like this, and it is always a hypothetical, "They're on to me, what should I do" Type of thing,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Worst thing I did was respond to it, but I guess I'm not alone,.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as 'gathering intel' - I meant, picking our brains. See how we'd respond to similar situations so they know what to do and what not to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Far fetched, but food for thought.

    This has to be an April fools thing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well just in case I am not busy at the moment so here it goes:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's unlikey you will get much if any time. You will probably go to drug court or some other diversion program.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is what happens if you don't plan for the worst case scenario and get caught off guard. My gosh you made their job so easy all they did was ask what you ordered and you spilled the beans right away. I doubt anything serious penalty awaits you. They may not even come back as you gave them enough to arrest you on the spot.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they do arrest you you will get a free lawyer if you can't afford one. You can contact the public defenders office ahead of time to see if they will represent you before you are charged. Some will do that and some don't. If you get a lawyer a head of time he/she can work something out if LE decides to arrest you such as a time to surrender and ROR or bail paid. If you wait, they may decide to come back after 5 on a Friday so you sit in jail till mon. However, your lawyer may find out that they of no intention of picking you up and you can relax.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Had you said, "What are you talking about" and denied the package they wouldn't have been able to prove anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is why people have to know there rights and what LE can and can not do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always deny you ordered the package then say nothing more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never consent to a search of your person or property.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never let LE into your house. If you know it is them don't even answer the door. Also don't step out side of your house. If you are going to talk to them (which you shouldn't) do so through the door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never make their job easy and your lawyers hard. You want that to be the other way around.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't plead your case to LE. You plead your case in court.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is a joke you managed to get 3 pages to the thread so, good I guess.

    :-\ Quite a bit disappointed in this group of posters. Thank you to all who have tried helping this person. Please everyone, keep in mind that not everyone has spent hours behind a monitor. Not all of us have taken classes to improve our knowledge of new technology. I am not giving out any excuses, but I feel we need to be more accommodating to someone asking for help. We do not know how LE is planning on approaching things SR related. We also do not know who on SR is LE. ALL of this is relatively new and no one should ever underestimate LE, which I see a lot of you doing in this thread. Did anyone stop to ask this poster about his method of acquiring his bitcoin? That is a question I would like answered.

    The OP could very well be sitting in a cell. Or, has gotten too paranoid to even bother with replying. Either way, I will assume ALL stories are true on here as far as LE is concerned. What is the worse that can happen? Make you more cautious? It obviously isn't stopping the market and I am pretty sure LE can see that, if in fact they are trying scare tactics this silly.

    If you look at Hovec's posting history it seems a little suspicious....his story seems to conflict with itself. He starts out in the Noob section trying to get to fifty, he answers a few questions and at one point he mentions that he order MDMA. He states the following "Ordered 1 gram of MDMA shipped to my parents place US to US to test the waters..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, 1 week later I call my mother to see if any mail arrived for me. She says "we don't get mail to our house" :l So she explains that there was mail stolen from mailboxes in the neighborhood yadayadayada and they switched to a P.O. Box and had all mail to their home stopped. She says that mail gets forwarded to their PO box that is sent to their home address but i'm weary because its Saturday and the sender said the order should arrive Thursday.. " (this indicates to me that he doesn't live at his parents house, at least not full time)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He starts posting on March 30th, the day he registered. He makes a handful of posts and then takes a break and resumes on April 1st, this is when the bulk of his posting takes place and its all the non-sense gibberish to get to 50 posts. He states on April 1st at 2:12 pm "need more drugs. less sobriety.
    <br/>
    its been 8 days so im hoping i get my package today from SR :D".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He stops posting at 3:21 pm on April 1st and comes back 5 hours later and at 8:07 pm says "Not sure where to put this, but I wasn't going to post it in the newbies forum.. Anyway, I made my first order from the silk road 9 days ago. Ordered 1 gram of mdma" - I believe that was his 50th post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Someone asked him about where he ordered it to and he states the following "Well thing is I live with my dad and its his house. I don't want him getting heat for what I ordered."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then he makes this odd statement while in the midst of berating everyone "The supposed trusted friend that paidfor the gram hasn't contacted measking where it is in 3 days now so I'm pretty sure he fucking ratted but I been fuckingwith him for years so idk what to think." And yet he never mentioned that he ordered this for a friend or that a friend paid for it earlier....we are lead to believe he ordered it for himself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And he hasn't logged back in since April 2nd. So I'm thinking 1 of 2 things is going on....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He saw we weren't buying it and decided to quit while he was ahead or he really is in jail but there were enough oddities about his story and inconsistencies that it is questionable at best whether this is true. And I am almost certain if the police come to your door and ask you questions about the drugs you ordered and you're dumb enough to answer the door in the first place and then say "yes the drugs are mine but I'm not comfortable saying anything else to you without a lawyer..."you are not going to be given two days to potentially destroy other incriminating evidence or leave the county/state you are in and get away. The whole thing reeks of bullshit.

    I'm sure lots of people are on here because they don't know how to buy drugs from criminals otherwise... Anyway if they have never had to deal with the police  on their ass before it could be quite a shock, hopefully if they understand these concepts enough it will be able to shine through in their scared clouded judgement state of mind.

    I don't believe this was a Apil fools joke. My friend was visited from the department of homeland security and he lives somewhat around the same area as the OP. He was smart tho and could tell they were prob cops by the way they were knocking, so he did not answer the door. There were two cars, both in unmarked, one was even a foreign car he thinks. He did not ever see the officers. They called and messaged his cell phone, but he has not replied. It has been almost 3 or 4 days with no contact from any LE. They did not kick in his door, even tho he was there with a dirty house and this was a 30+g package I guess from a trusted vendor up north. Too bad the OP was so scared he thought admitting it would save his ass. Hope to see him reply.

    It is good to know that at least some people are prepared for the worst. But I do not think this was made up, as my friend got a visit from the department of homeland security a few days after the OP posted around the same area. Vender even confirmed LE intercepting package.

    This is well said and damned humane of you I would add. The object lesson here, I think, is that you practice your damn story. Even if it's just a bare excuse. Even if it's just "I want to talk to my lawyer." If LE are challenging you, they're looking for the dead giveaway reaction. And the only way to not give it to them is to be one stone cold mofo, or to practice. I drive the same way. "If *this* were to happen, I would do that..." I rehearse, just every once in awhile. Cause when you're finally in the moment you're in the moment.

    True Story:
    <br/>
    I know a couple of cats that were in the weed biz. One guy from the east coast sends about $20K via fedex, in a book (middle cut out) to a medical marijuana state.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's intercepted (how is still a mystery), and the "Task Force" (state narcos) show up and start quizzing his wife about the cash (he wasn't home). The dude didn't really fit the profile (although he was in fact a mid-level dealer - probably brokering 20lbs a month, growing another 10-20)...kids, nice condo, real job, clean cut. The cops knew he was up to no good, but he clammed up and sent them to his attorney. The cops eventually just faded away. He's still dealing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cops go for low hanging fruit. If you're easy, they'll nail you. If you are slippery, they might lose interest, unless you get somebody with a hard-on, or your moving serious weight. Then the feds take notice, but same story with them. They got numbers to make, reports to write, all that jazz. State narcos really are supposed to chase the big players, but are hassled all the time with low and mid-level guys. It's all an evil numbers game...

      I told him I had ordered 1 gram of mdma for personal use. He tells me it was methamphetamine. So I'm guessing either mdma shows up as meth in their tests or the vendor sent me meth.

So he says hes going to give me two days to think about it and then hes coming back with papers. And in cop talk that basically means he wamts me to turn snitch because he assumes I know who sent it to me. So basically I'm going to jail when he comes back. Luckily I only ordered a gram.

     WHY would you admit to ordering it and tell them exactly what you ordered?!?!?!  Have you read anything on these forums?  You NEVER admit to it and you NEVER answer questions like that -- you talk to a lawyer!

    If you give info to cops that isn't legally required (like name/address), you sorta deserve the penalty.
