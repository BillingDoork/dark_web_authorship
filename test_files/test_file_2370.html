    Hi
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A friend of SWIM living in the U.S has recently starting sending sending SWIM packages of California indoor grown bud of roughly 1kg which he sells. This was going well until this final package got sent to UK Customs, this has previously happened but the result was paying import/VAT on the package as it's declared as something with a value of roughly $100. This time it's been with customs for a week according to SWIM who called the parcel company who stated this . Now SWIM would like to know :
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a) Is the contents of said package in a Customs evidence room?
    <br/>
    b) If so will they try to sting him with a delivery? And if so will tracking change at all?
    <br/>
    c) Or will they leave it alone
    <br/>
    d) If SWIM gets arrested what is he looking at legally? Also what defense if any can be used?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FYI SWIM and his American friend have looked up the tracking on their home computers? And SWIM called up the delivery company from his mobile phone which can be traced to him. Your knowledge, thoughts and speculation would be greatly appreciated.

    It's not declared with an extremely high value, if their intention was for the recipient to pay tax I'd assume I'd have the slip by now. Regarding SWIM I'm feeling extremely paranoid at the moment so any help would be appreciated.

    You have made some beginner mistakes my friend. Hopefully they won't trace the call you made to the delivery company which connects you to the contents of the import (they get thousands of daily calls though and I doubt they record all calls). I would remove the computer you used to trace the package from your house as well in case they seize it and see that you used the tracking information. Unless you used Tor to trace the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it gets delivered, then write 'return to sender' on the packaging and don't open! Wait a few days then remove it from your premises.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Get your friend to pay all import duty if possible or find an anonymous way to pay. If you pay for the import tax then you will be connected to the import and will get done for importing a controlled substance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the package has actually been pulled in for a search then I guess that they will either just send you a love letter or try and setup a sting. However, if your friend put $100 as the value of the contents then there will certainly be import tax to pay. All imports over £40 in value are obliged to pay VAT and Duty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't get caught with 1KG of Weed!

    You're on the deepweb.. you don't need to state SWIM every time you're referring to yourself/shipper. I get weight shipped domestically from an IRL friend of mine that lives in so-cal so I've never had this problem. I'd imagine it's pretty nerve racking. I wish the best of luck to you!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just an FYI, you should probably learn the safe practices of shipping shit through the mail and simple precautions to take throughout the process. You seem like you have no business doing this, AKA tracking the shipment from your home computer, calling them on his mobile device that's registered most likely in his name?!?!?! Why are you people not using your NOGGIN! You're dealing with drugs here.. and those people you're calling to check up on your package believe it or not are out to get people like you! So don't be an idiot..

    Why would you declare the value at $100? That's well above the import VAT limit, even if it's marked as a gift, unless it's a zero rated item. Courier companies will usually automatically charge the recipient any tax, duties and handling fees and even with the regular mail if they see it has a chargeable value (most stuff gets through) they'll pull it and in rare cases open it for inspection.

    they'll probably have to send it off to test it - clean house and expect a knock on the door anywhere between 2-4 weeks.(and yes it can take this long and that's from experience)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    don't want to overly worry you but as there's a traceable history of $100 packages to you (from tax records - did you pay by card?) you've also reduced your plausible denyability - make sure there's not a scrap of anything in the house and a good answer to what the previous parcels were.

    yeah thats gonna help if they were to do a controlled delivery especially on a amount of such they wouldn't wait 2-3 days so you can move the product somewhere else think about that they would do it as soon as it gets dropped off and in your possession
