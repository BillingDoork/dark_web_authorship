    So how does one go about shipping a heavy package annonymously? By heavy i mean packages &gt; 13 ounces. I read that if any item is over 13 OZ, it cannot just be shipped with stamps on and alot of postal offices will just return the mail if they do find an overweight box during collection. I'm thinking about using an automated machines to print my stamps on the spot but are there better alternatives? Thanks to all who contribute to this topic!

    Just buy and print your shipping labels online. It will only take a few minutes to figure out, and your packages will be forever more discrete and organized.

    I read that on the blue collection box itself. You can google 13OZ weight limit and the pictures will have what i'm talking about. Also, the postage workers keep on reiterating that to me and told me to make sure my package was less than 13 OZ or else i "needed to bring it in."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unfortunately breaking up a large order could potentially multiply my shipping costs by as much as five times so that is definitely not an option for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the printing postage online, i've thought about that but havent researched much into it. I don't like the fact that i'm typing my customer's address onto an online form though. It just makes me paranoid to do stuff like that :/

    Under 13 oz you can send at first class postage rate which is the cheapest. Over 13 oz it has to go parcel post which is more expensive, the cost from just at or under 13 oz to 14 oz is about $2 more. So breaking it up into several shipments will not usually cost you any more and you avoid the post office cameras. If that shipment gets intercepted you don't want them going back over video footage to see what you look like.

    If your package weighs over 13 oz, you must drop it off in person. Collect your stamps, DCNs, priority envelopes from a USPS store that's 50+ miles away from your outbound shipping location. Wear sunglasses when you go to pick them up, or find someone you can pay to do this for you. You can just walk in and pick up stacks of this shit, and they won't say anything to you. It's free til you ship shit out with em. Then, you throw gloves on, wipe down all your prints, and package that shit up. Dont just wear later gloves, because your pritns will bleed through those. Heavy gloves oor extra padding for your fingertips within latex gloves. Find a USPS shipping location that's not an actual USPSstore i.e. Office Depot, a storage facility. This gives postal inspectors more hoops to jump through if they try to reverse the package back to your face. Wear sunglasses again! When you go in, obv cant be wearing gloves, so what I do is use my wrist to hold my package to my hip, and then I have my phone in my other hand acting like I'm texting furiously. Then I just shove the package up to the assisstant at USPS when it's my turn in line. Pay cash! Voila, no prints, no face on camera.

    Today i went into an automated postage center and printed stamps using an anonymous debit card that i bought off a vendor. I threw the box in at the spot. i think this way is much better than having to go into a postal office though you would need to invest in one of these cards. My package this time weighed less than 13 OZ at exactly 12.67OZ so no matter what it should be fine, however, I am going to ask a postal worker tomorrow whether or not i can ship packages &gt;13 OZ using an automated machine. BTW the collection boxes with handles say the limit is 16OZ not 13 OZ like other collection boxes say.... totally weird....

    I've seen people go in the po, drop a box with postage already paid on it on an unused counter with out a clerk and walk back out. I've tried this myself using stamps and it always worked. It keeps you from getting your photo taken. People do it to avoid standing in line.

    that only works for packages below 13 OZ. The whole point of doing this is so that if the LE find out that some idiot was shipping lets say a bomb or something and it killed someone, they can track down the person who did it via a)cameras or b)the card he purchased the printed stamps. So option A is out of the question but to avoid being caught while using option B, one needs an annon debit card. Worth investment IMO.

    Who told you that? The 13 oz rule is for blueboxes. I said i went into the post office and put it on the counter and it was over 13 oz. I've seen people drop off boxes full of packages and some were certainly well over 13 oz. I've gone in and seen stacks of packages and they don't give you a second look when you put another box beside the others.

As for the 13oz rule, i've asked around 6 postal workers now. They all say the same shit. Bring it in or automated machine are the only options. You just did number the first option.

    Look, it's just a bad idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are supposed to swarm packages, not concentrate them. Ideally you shouldn't send &gt; 10 grams in 1 package! For weed maybe an ounce. Maybe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you focus on your P&amp;P you're being penny wise pound foolish as the Brits say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you post lots of large packages, that's a real good way to attract attention. Conversely you could fire off hundreds of little packages and by mixing up your packaging it becomes impossible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, there is safety in numbers, that is the overall message of anonymity theory. The minute you're over an ounce you're in a much smaller category of packages. With each gram extra, the probability of interception increases precipitously, it's not a linear progression, it's geometric. Every piece of research I've seen on product in the mail supports that idea.

    Pine, i agree with you. For drugs it makes more sense to break up a larger shipment into smaller ones. But what do you do if its a laptop? They don't break up too well or don't go back together too well after breaking up. Or a gun in which the barrel weighs more than that or a few other things that you can't break up? My tec is just for special occasions, not for every time.

    The cameras watch each station and correspond to a transaction so that if they find dope they can go back and see what the person looked like. Yes, they may scan the whole post office and who knows how long they keep those records? ProbablyÂ  not long but lets say they do keep them a long time. They sort through the whole day's recording which is about 10 hours. If they haven't fallen asleep by the time you come up or aren't bs'ing with a coworker, they see someone leaving a package on a counter just like dozens of other people who came in. There is no way to connect you with the exact package unless you did it up with a red bow or something to make it easy for them. They can say it was probably one of those people but can't say for sure which one
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know some dealers go up to the counter and send it off and that is 100 times more dangerous unless they have a good disguise because they know for sure which one sent the package and what they look like. Why not use your disguise and set it on the counter like i said? Then you have 2 things going for you and they are always too busy to notice if you are wearing a wig or fake mustache unless its so bad that people at a distance start to stare at you. No ronald mcdonald costumes!

    Are people really buying so many pounds of drugs that vendors cant afford to ship it anon? I mean 13 ounces is almost a frickin pound, last time i checked a ounce of anything costs at least $200, so people are shipping over $2k worth of goods and their bitching about paying a few extra bucks to break it up, shit is crazy.

    As for the fella shipping laptops, really, you think their gonna track you down when the drug dogs find your laptop? jesus the amount of stupidity on here.

    @sunny1, why risk being on camera at all? IDK about you but I want to avoid being on cameras at all costs.

    As for everyone else, I just wanted to let everyone know that the automated machine + annonymous debit card method worked very well. It was delivered successfully without any issues or delay. Bought the postage+DCN on the spot. I hope this thread helps whomever is wanting to send big packages.

    I'd really like to hear from other cannabis vendors. Are you using small boxes or bubble mailers?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my non-SR life, I've been using boxes and haven't had any trouble (~4 years). But that's probably just their ineptitude, not my cleverness. I want to use best practices as a vendor here.

    I dropped off a box today, put it on the counter and i was wearing wrap around sunglasses. No one gave me a second look. It was legit stuff but i'm just saying. What if you want to send a laptop? Its not illegal but you don't want them having a pic of you just in case. You do the drop off. What other way is there?
