    1. A customer informed us that a package was opened, then taped back up and it was then send to the customer. One pill was missing.
    <br/>
    Should we believe this? Why the hell would customs open a package, take one pill and then let it continue on its journey??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Everything always arrives(d). No problem with shipping super illegal stuff like ghb.
    <br/>
    And now we get many orders for our dexamphetamine and guess what? They don't arrive 90% of the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We do not understand how this is possible. The dexies have no smell but to be sure we vac seal them anyways.
    <br/>
    We also changed stealth for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What the hell is going on? Are we being scammed or what?
    <br/>
    Old virmo and now we as new virmo always had a perfect (100). Then got one 2/5 which fucked it all up and now it's 96 since today while we dit not receive new feedback or see what has been altered...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We could practically throw effexors in a padded envelope with no effort to hide it. But well hidden dexies are detected?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And customs nowadays does not send love letters anymore? Is that correct?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That seems pretty impossible to us. We think that the buyers get the product and then lie about it in the hope that they will get more for free or something...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And customs opening something, then taping it back up and letting it continue through the mail, while taking out one pill? wtf?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This all just seems a bit unrealistic to us...

    What do people think about using a return address that is somebody that you know?
    <br/>
    IF somebody gets returned then you will have your stash back. The person who gets all these weird mails knows about nothing...

    That seems right!
    <br/>
    I´m missing 2-3 orders (1 maybe not sent) and I´m waiting for a love letter (2 months now).
    <br/>
    Still not received.
    <br/>
    I think they will send such a piece eighter above a special amount of gr or above a special amount of seized packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I´m wondering too...   but I´m happy with it!

    You are what?
    <br/>
    Thinking virmo did not ship at all? For what orders?
    <br/>
    Virmo always ships and loses product and cash.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you did not get something then it's not her fault. Everything is stealthy and the right amount or +1.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Contact her personally if you have any problems!

    correction: use the search function. Virmo is nothing but genuine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are probably one of her scammers. Shame on you.

    Better hope you don't accidently roll them under the bus if LE tracks the package back to the return address!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can picture in my head a buddy hanging out smoking a bowl playing COD when LE comes w/ a warrant because they followed the package.

    Yes, but the return address is not the actual senders address ofcourse.
    <br/>
    This is in the netherlands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Things changed, all dexies arrive safe and sound like they should. And people use them with proper directions about usage.
