    Hello everyone,
    <br/>
    Over the course of the past year I have been getting packages sent to my personal address. Recently although I received a love letter after a package did not make it. That now means that if I were to order to that address I would have to be extremely careful, or not order to there at all. So that brings up the point, how do I pick secondary addresses? Of course I could get my buddies to receive the packages, but I do not want them to be involved in this trade because they could truly screw me over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have seen that many bulk buyers use burn houses and receive the packages there, but how do they pick out the homes/apartments in the first place? It seems to me that would be the best way to go versus a P.O box opened with fake information. All of the apartments are gated with 24 hour security around my area, and the closest ones that are not is around at least an hour away including traffic. If I were to pick a home it seems like the only ones to go with are vacant, wouldn't it be odd for the "vacant house" to be receiving packages?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now once I pick an address to send to how would I go about picking up packages? In the wee hours in the morning, or during the regular daytime traffic? If I were to get caught, it would be within the personal use amount, but would I have anyway to defend myself?

    But, remember, by opening a PO Box with a fake ID, you're committing other crimes in the process. If you're in the United State, you're making at least a felony with using a forged ID. Possibly more of a crime than getting the drug in the mail.

    If you're only ordering personal use amounts just get a trusted friend to get them for you and give them a freebie for the hassle no?

    A 20$ or a 50$ usually is good enough for any one of the friends, no excuses needed.
