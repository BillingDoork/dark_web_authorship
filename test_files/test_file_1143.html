    Hello.. I made 4 purchases all from different vendors about 12 days ago and none of them have come yet, any ideas why? I waited for the mailman everyday for the first week and an order from eBay came through but nothing from silk road..  so there is no chance somebody has been stealing my packages
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and I am 100% sure the addresses I gave the vendors were all correct
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I feel very bad because 2 of these orders were samples and I wanted to leave a review but its not looking good so far :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anybody know whats going on  ???

    Sorry to hear that.
    <br/>
    Have you contacted the vendors to see what they say?

    It's hard to say.  I wouldn't necessarily say anything is "going on" without more info.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do the vendors you purchased from have a presence on the boards here?  What do people say about them when you search their name?
    <br/>
    Are your orders domestic or international?
    <br/>
    Are your orders stinky or inert?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had a package from the deep southern US take over 30 days, but most get here within a week or two.

    If it is domestic I would be a bit worried but if it was international I would take a breather and give it another week or even two.  Sometimes mails just go slow as fuck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I would not order anything for now and just in case, expect the worse so be on your toes.
