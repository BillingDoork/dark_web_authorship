    Hello. I used to ship express packages like this. I would just put a $20 express stamp on the pack and put it in the blue boxes. USPS would deliver them without any issues.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I haven't done this for a long time, but recently, I tried to do this with a $12.35 Medium Flat Rate Priority box. Luckily, this was just a care package for a family member, not narcotics so I used my real return address. The next day, it got returned to me. The mailman said that I need to bring packages like that directly into the post office now because of new rules.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So.... does this apply to flat rate express envelopes too?
    <br/>
    Does this apply to $5.60 Small Flat Rate Priority Mail boxes / envelopes too?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or does this just apply to medium + large boxes?

    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're using stamps and dropping it in the box it has to be 13oz or less.

    Your box most likely got returned because it was over 13oz. You can drop express priority first class etc in the blue box (express has a different blue box though I believe...at least here they do) as long as its under 13 oz, then you have to take it to the counter. I've had to take multiple illegal packages to the counter due to issues with the APC or not being able to print postage online. Honestly, pretty much no matter what you do, you really can't get postage anonymously, unless you're putting multiple stamps on the pack, which is going to look pretty unprofessional, especially when mailing priority and express. Just make sure you package your shit the right way, and you really don't have to worry about anonymity. I've been a vendor for just a couple months, i've mailed over 60 packages, and none have been intercepted or lost or anything else.

    Correction, stamped mail has to be under 13oz, so yes that could have been the issue. But you can use shipping labeled packages in blue boxes at any weight as long as it fits in the bluebox.

    What kind of shipping labels?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where can I get prepaid postage labels to put on express/priority so that I don't have to go in the office?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How can I send express without HANDWRITING my label?

    Any labels will do.  The more professional looking the better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can buy prepaid labels online but stamps are the best way to stay anonymous as everyone on these forums knows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't mind paying online with a prepaid card (or maybe a VCC if it works) and then printing the express label, just use the USPS site.  I'd advise against this as well, just handwrite them or give up on USPS Express because it has gone to trash.

    If you wanted to blend in then you would hand write on an express envelope like everyone else. :o  That is standard for those envelopes.  By the way, a type writer is one of the simplest writing styles to match.  The keys all strike different on different type writers.

    A simple question merits a simple answer.  I didn't recommend a typewriter be used nor would I recommend one type out Express labels...but not for the reason you state.   Obviously, every typewriter leaves unique markings but then so does handwriting(I'm no expert but I'm guessing pen strokes would be much easier to match.)  By the way, my reply wasn't intended to be taken seriously but in hindsight I guess I should have known better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Were I to leave a more instructive and useful reply(at the risk of coming across as boorish) I'd have to answer the question with another question.  WHY are you shipping contraband via Express Mail in the first place??  Your stated goal of "blending in" is in direct opposition to what you will unwittingly achieve by shipping Express.   First of all, Postal Inspectors look much harder at Express mail for contraband than any other class of mail. Why? The answer is pretty simple.  Experience tells them based on previous seizures a great number of people sending drugs in the mail use EXPRESS.  I don't know what percentage of their seizures come from Express packs but Inspectors have publicly stated Express Mail is on top of their "watch" list.  Secondly, common sense tells you the best bet for blending in is to have your package travel in the class of mail most widely used.  I don't have the figures for a complete break down by class but I do have paints a pretty clear picture.  In 2011 total mail volume was 168 BILLION pieces processed.  Of that total,  First Class stamped mail totaled 25.8 BILLION.  Priority mail ...791 MILLION pieces.  Obviously, Express Mail pieces total a only a fraction of the Priority mail figure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are serious about blending in you'd be using First Class and certainly not Express, no question about it. Trying to blend in using Express Mail is akin to mixing diet coke with your rum because you are trying to lose weight.  If you were serious about weight loss you wouldn't be drinking rum in the first place.  Using Express for drugs in the mail is one of the most common mistakes people who get busted make.   Experienced, smart sellers do not offer Express because they know it's an unnecessary risk.  Smart, experienced buyers are also patient buyers.   Staying out of trouble in this game is all about minimizing the risks.

      I've had to take multiple illegal packages to the counter due to issues with the APC or not being able to print postage online. Just make sure you package your shit the right way, and you really don't have to worry about anonymity. I've been a vendor for just a couple months, i've mailed over 60 packages, and none have been intercepted or lost or anything else.

    I'm sure they do...however, due to the size of my operation (very small, I sell mostly oxycodone, at most about 100 a month between few people), why order from me? Why order from someone who has no listings for a week or two a month, instead of someone supplying consistant demand of oxycodone, or heroin for that matter? Someone like me is low on their watch list, if at all. Taking one or two packages to the counter a month isn't that great of a risk...and even if it was, I can guarantee they're not going to be able to link my mailing to SR or any other part of the darknet..my precautions have been taken, and very seriously at that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, my methods of shipping have changed dramatically, and I haven't even so much as entered a PO parking lot in at least a few weeks, if not a month or so. Very happy about that one.

     A simple question merits a simple answer.  I didn't recommend a typewriter be used nor would I recommend one type out Express labels...but not for the reason you state.   Obviously, every typewriter leaves unique markings but then so does handwriting(I'm no expert but I'm guessing pen strokes would be much easier to match.)  By the way, my reply wasn't intended to be taken seriously but in hindsight I guess I should have known better.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Were I to leave a more instructive and useful reply(at the risk of coming across as boorish) I'd have to answer the question with another question.  WHY are you shipping contraband via Express Mail in the first place??  Your stated goal of "blending in" is in direct opposition to what you will unwittingly achieve by shipping Express.   First of all, Postal Inspectors look much harder at Express mail for contraband than any other class of mail. Why? The answer is pretty simple.  Experience tells them based on previous seizures a great number of people sending drugs in the mail use EXPRESS.  I don't know what percentage of their seizures come from Express packs but Inspectors have publicly stated Express Mail is on top of their "watch" list.  Secondly, common sense tells you the best bet for blending in is to have your package travel in the class of mail most widely used.  I don't have the figures for a complete break down by class but I do have paints a pretty clear picture.  In 2011 total mail volume was 168 BILLION pieces processed.  Of that total,  First Class stamped mail totaled 25.8 BILLION.  Priority mail ...791 MILLION pieces.  Obviously, Express Mail pieces total a only a fraction of the Priority mail figure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you are serious about blending in you'd be using First Class and certainly not Express, no question about it. Trying to blend in using Express Mail is akin to mixing diet coke with your rum because you are trying to lose weight.  If you were serious about weight loss you wouldn't be drinking rum in the first place.  Using Express for drugs in the mail is one of the most common mistakes people who get busted make.   Experienced, smart sellers do not offer Express because they know it's an unnecessary risk.  Smart, experienced buyers are also patient buyers.   Staying out of trouble in this game is all about minimizing the risks.

    Mostly agreed but I think I'd go with priority for anything boxy/cardboard within the US. While the majority of the total mail stream is First Class and below, if you only take into account packages/parcels I think priority mail would be hands down the best camouflage.

    You're distributing and lots of people much smaller than you get busted every day.  The war on drugs isn't logical.  Stay safe.
