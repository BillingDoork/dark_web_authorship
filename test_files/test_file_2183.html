    After hours of reading, I found very little info on Japan. I did find two references here to "particle-sniffers", which are apparently some kind of super-tech in use at all points of entry in Japan. Anybody know about these, or have any general experience with solid vacuuming being able to make it in or not?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does the lack of info basically reflect a dearth of users from there, or that the country is just locked up tight so nobody bothers?

    I know a person who has successfully completed over 20 transactions into Japan across a wide range of substances, including ones that you would think more easily detected...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So unless these sniffers have just been rolled out in the last few weeks I'd say there is no fire without smoke.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, there seems to be absolutely now way to get Bit Coins anonymously in Japan.
    <br/>
    You have to leave a paper trail of some kind.
    <br/>
    And the irony is that Bit Coins were invented by a Japanese guy...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This all seems pretty typical of Japan.
    <br/>
    People have this image that Japan is very strict and draconian, it isn't.
    <br/>
    They just like to make the occasional big song and dance about a drugs offense.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For a prolonged period people were selling 'research chemicals' openly in the streets with signs that read 'natural highs' or 'legal psychedelics'. There were a few too many complaints and complications/hospitalizations and that party fizzled after passing through a series of loop holes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before then, magic mushrooms were sold openly for many many years.
    <br/>
    They banned the overt sale of mushrooms when they hosted the world cup. And they ceased to become overtly available pretty much overnight.
    <br/>
    Bottom line (speculative): they trusted their own population to be sensible with the mushies, but they didn't want to take the same chance on a large number of random foreign tourists.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suspect that Japan basically has things rigged so that if they want to/need to crack down on SR etc the hammer can fall swift and hard. They know who has Bit Coins, and may well be letting packages through but just keeping a note of who is receiving what. Japan doesn't see things as being a problem on principle, something is a problem when it causes a problem. Hell, it's not even big on using things as a political football.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would say that the 3 big dangers to a SR user based in Japan are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    America really cracking down on SR and trying to force other countries to follow suit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Too much stuff making it's way in the hands on the Japanese youth via SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Being the unlucky person who Japan decides to make an example of in the news.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, I fear the eventual hammer, so I've yet to transact. But that's just because I am very cautious.

    The Finnish customs have been using particle sniffers for quite an while. They are very sensitive of moisture and other factors like air temperature. They can sense trance amounts of chemicals in the air I believe. But what I have understood, since installing these devices they haven't been able to really do shit about contraband moving into the country through mail. These machines don't beat an good old man's best friend.

    You could always use a service of the same kind Vlad1m1r provided. Send cash overseas via mail to a broker who acquires the coins for you.
    <br/>
    Also there is no factual proof that the original creator was actually Japanese I believe. The pseudoanonymous name of "the creator" just happens to be Japanese. No one in the public really knows who is this mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, or is he/she even a single person at all. It could always be an group split around the globe.

    I would also like to find out more information about pruchasing/vending to Japan. Why is it that it's impossible to get Bitcoins without leaving a trail in Japan? Also, how successful is shipment with low level of smell?

    I have a friend living in Tokyo who does drugs when he can but is way too afraid to even consider ordering from SR because if you do get arrested for drug charges in Japan, especially as a foreigner, they will fuck you over big time and give you a massive prison sentence and it takes a long time before you even get a trial.  He told me about a guy who did about a year or so in prison for less than half a gram of weed.  Personally I wouldn't order from overseas there for the same reason but as a vendor I wouldn't mind shipping there as it's down to the customer to take the risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as the customs over there, I don't think it's as advanced as they make it out to be sometimes, because I've flown to Tokyo many times and never once have I seen drug dogs there unlike in many other places.  Still as a customer or drug user I wouldn't risk having anything on me there just in case something unlucky were to happen.  Even if they don't have particle sniffers everywhere you never know if some Japanese customs agent might get curious about a package and decide to take a look.  There you most certainly wouldn't just receive a customs letter in that situation, you'd probably get immediately raided and detained for importing drugs.  I think many people there probably know about SR but are too afraid to use it because of the potential consequences of being caught which is probably why there aren't that many Japanese SR users.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Indeed the other post is very much right that Japan didn't use to be so strict on drugs, but has become more so over the years because of pressure from mainly the US.  I remember I bought mescaline caps in Tokyo from a small headshop back in the early 2000's, not sure if they were legal but the same place sold magic mushrooms too which at the time definitely were legal.
