    and the reason why is unknown (carrier lost package or it was intercepted by them).. what are you supposed to do?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a) have vendor re-ship the package to the same address.
    <br/>
    b) ask for a partial or full refund.
    <br/>
    c) have item re-sent to another address that is not flagged (i don't really know anyone who is willing to accept a package. one person i think who would entertain the idea lives close to me, and the post office would have flagged the from address and connect the fact that this new address is near mine). i am also against registering a PO box, with either a real or fake ID.
    <br/>
    d) probably the best course of action is to wait another 3-4 weeks. if no love letter arrives, then it may be safe to assume the package was lost in transit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'm not sure what to do. a vendor that i purchased from 8-9 days ago sent out a package US to US and it hasn't arrived yet. in my experience, a package via USPS priority (or a small mail package) rarely takes longer than 5 days from coast to coast. most of the orders (made to the vendor i chose) arrived to their location within 3-5 days.. so im certain my case is an aberration. i also know that a USPS package arrived to my city from across the country (not SR-related) in 3 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'm not quite sure what to do, since if my address is flagged, they'd intercept the new package. in this case, the vendor would lose out on 2 packages of his/her product, and i'd lose my bitcoins - it's a lose/lose situation.

    Theres no real answer to this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hence why the vendors give you the option to make a choice for yourself.
    <br/>
    Different circumstances for each situation for each action you can take
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, I would try getting it reshipped again. since there is less risk domestic.
    <br/>
    But I would first do some more research on the vendor, if everything checks out then get a reship, if not then refund.

    thanks for response.. the vendor i chose has excellent feedback. he's a top 10% vendor with almost 300 transactions at 100%. i don't think he's ripped me off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW, how long can i extend an order? i'm still a newbie so i'm unsure how the "resolve" link works. i think the vendor i chose has more reason to think of me as a scammer than i do him. i think option d may be the best route. i'm going to have to wait 3-4 more weeks before i even consider asking for a re-shipment or refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i do take some comfort that my vendor has lots of positive feedback when it comes to stealth. but then again, i don't know what his method is, and what method USPS uses to detect packages. also, the feedback system is not perfect.

    looks like it was as i suspected, the vendor is probably within 1k miles from me and it hasn't arrived yet. i'm stuck in a really hard place right now.

    you shouldnt be too worried if you have consumption amounts only. they're not likely to do all that much to you.

    Never EVER FE!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In almost a year of purchasing from 2 different accounts here on The Road, I've never FE'd. I've never not had a package cum to me except for 1 right now. I went against my feelings to purchase another package from Europe! I live on the west coast of the USA. But I can't find a vendor in the USA that sells Speed. Why try Speed when I love meth?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Weeeeeeeelllllllll, that's a good question. All Amphetamine Sulfate - Speed - used to be EoS. Then sometime in the late 80's or early 90's meth started coming in crystal form. Shrug? A wasted set of refinements, washes and reductions in my opinion as I IV my drugs! And back then - there was no diffffrrrrrrrace Toot'sweet! It ALL made any man or women into a beautiful raging sex feign! Why else would anyone want to do that shit! Lol!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So .... back to packages not coming! I was notified by Silk Road - who I have always loved and supported mostly because if you don't FE, you'll never loose you money if you don't get your package - Weeeeeelllllll, now they are telling me that just because I don't FE, doesn't mean I'll get my funds back! (that's not what they told me over and over again when I first found SR in Oct. of 2011!) I - not so politely - explained to them that the thousands in SR fees I've paid in this past 12 months or so - will be the last they EVER receive from me if I don't get every penny back in a few days when my 3 week extension I gave that vendor whose package STILL has not cum to get a simple 5 gram package to me - (of which I made 2 similar sized orders from BoyMaster that I received before 5 days was up!) - is up!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's right people - 2 days from Spain to The Great NorthWest - USA. The second one, 6 grams got here in 4 days! From Spain! Don't ask me how he did it - but it did happen exactly as I said here!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will let you know if Silk Road is worth a shit of what they preach if I receive or don't receive my full refund! I know he never sent it as several other buyers got theirs in 10 days! Both to the USA. That is not realistic that my package - closing on 29 days - has not made it here! That vendor has not responded to any questions about it other than to accept the gracious 3 week extension I gave them! And it will be the very first package of almost 50! that didn't make it. The very first!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still maintain until then - if you FE you're just kissing off any protection at all! If you do as suggested here - to speak nicely to the vendor - and they don't respond - try NOT being so nice! What do you have to loose if they're not going to speak to you anyway!

    i think you have to take into consideration that SR is here to protect both the seller and the vendor from scams.. i'm guessing that if you don't FE, but the vendor shows SR a valid tracking ID, then they are likely to side with the vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you have to remember that vendors are taking a huge risk in selling what they do, and it makes things even tougher for them when buyers end up scamming them or are overly aggressive with their demands. if SR does not protect vendors, then there will be much less incentive for people to sell their goods. same goes for the buyers.
