    I asked this question in the newbie forum (just hit 50 posts, thank God), but I figured I would get some more well-rounded replies here, so forgive me if I'm violating SR forum etiquette! Anyways, here goes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For anyone not in the know, APO addresses are for shipping to military addresses overseas. Let's say I was to order 10 tabs of LSD from Tesselated. I heard he's a legit vendor with good stuff and excellent stealth. What are the odds of this getting caught in the military postal system? Does anyone know if APO mail is subject to more scrutiny than regular mail? I know blotter tabs are hard to detect in regular mail, but I haven't heard testimony from anyone on military shipping. I tried searching here and on the Silk Road subreddit and couldn't come up with anything that helped. I'd really appreciate any info on the subject. Thanks.

    There are plenty of people who make use of the military postal system who aren't necessary military themselves.
