    I'm asking these questions as a UK buyer and specifically about weed. Does anyone have experience with getting larger amounts of weed sent through royal mail to them, like 7g's and upwards ? At the moment I've only had 1g package's but in the future i would like to try and ordering a bigger amount, just worried it'd be more detectable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other question is does anyone have experience with ordering weed from outside the UK to the UK ? I'm really tempted to try some weed from another country, if the seller does worldwide postage. It's just when i think about it having to get through customs i kind of think "hmmmm that's probably a bad idea"

    Nothing... you just have to take the loss. Depending on the amount... consider the address burned.

    Anyone got a seller they recommend that ships good weed world wide ? It'll save me going through a ton of listing and checking the postage options.

    Hey bunnyburt, here's a few guys who might interest you:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b54698f8da - Marijuana Is My Muse  - Ships from Canada, damn fine weed, prices are crazy low. His G13 is great.
    <br/>
    http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/bc1602d49e - budsupplies - Ships from Germany, the S5 is fucking beautiful stuff. More expensive than MIMM, but since it's Europe I find it's about 4 working days for delivery, not bad!
    <br/>
    http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e4f447f64a - revenantchild - Ships from South Africa, the weed's not brilliant, but it does the job, and since it's cheap as chips it's worth it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's a bunch more great vendors out there, but these ones I have personal experience with. Happy shopping!
