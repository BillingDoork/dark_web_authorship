    God I feel like such an idiot.  I am an idiot!  I used the wrong +4 zip code with the correct 5 digit zip code.  So I assume from what I've read that it got to my post office but maybe went with the incorrect mail carrier.  The thing is I'm having it delivered to my PO Box.  In the U.S. too if you were wondering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So would they recognize that and not give it to the mail carrier?  Or would the mail carrier get it and take it on the route and then bring it back and hopefully they put it in my PO Box?  Anyone ever do this?  What happened?

    It might end up in the wrong mail bag, the delivery person will bounce it back and someone will eventually correct it and it will be delivered.

    This sort of error causes the package to spend more time in postal worker's hands and causes more scrutiny. As long as there is no smell or other red flags it should get to you eventually.

    Well all is well and I hit the panic button a bit too soon.  I think my next purchase is going to be some Valium because I just worry myself sick waiting on these packages and could use some severe anxiety relief.  Even though I used the wrong +4 on the zip the package showed up timely.  In the future I'm never using the +4 digits on the zip code again.  Don't ask why I did in the first place.  I guess I wasn't thinking.
