    New to this amazing site and want to make sure I'm doing things right. Trying to ship with the most anonymity and security possible and hoping some generous soul will help answer any questions I have or be able to link me to a comprehensive guide that helps me further.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have many questions pertaining to security, how to package, how to ship, buyer/seller anonymity and safety, Do's and Don't, among others.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To get the ball rolling, I have my product that may look suspicious in a bubble mailer, or maybe not, but I don't want to take the risk of it getting flagged and so on. I've read the less time in the PO the better so I'm not really sure how to go about packaging this and getting going on my sales.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help will be appreciated!

    Giving away specific packaging methods on the public forum is generally frowned upon :\
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, the general thought should be "will this package withstand the abuse of the postal system (machines and people not really giving a fuck about the fragility of the contents in your box) , the scrutiny of postal surveillance (Postal inspectors, dogs, particle sniffers, and X-ray style shit), and even if it broke open and the contents fell out, would they look unassuming enough to be put back in the box and taped up?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The US post office is very overwhelmed, you could probably ship a pound of weed put straight into a box and it would probably get there 70% of the time. But you don't want to do that, it's risky for you and your clients. I'm just trying to say they don't pay very close attention. I can vouch, I have worked for a major shipping company and we routinely had bags and boxes that were obviously coke, weed, and pills. And what did we do? Hurl them as fast as possible without thinking twice. Nobody gives a fuck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hyperocity's "Secrets of of a shipping NINJA" or whatever it's called has some useful information, but it was all stuff I had thought of before. Regardless, I would say it's an invaluable start.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helps.

    I can understand not wanting to give away specific shipping methods. I guess I'm just looking for a procedure to make sure I'm not leaving traces behind and what to use for a particular product I'm selling.
