    I know I have read about this somewhere else but I can't remember what it said. It seems that if the stealth is decent and the package isn't larger than your box that you could get things shipped to that box with no problem. Could someone verify that it's a good or bad idea and anything to expect if someone were to do this?

    Po boxes are very handy. But when you order don't ever put in po box xyz. The name and address will do. The company will find you and place it in your box. Benefits is more chances for a international delivery passing customs. Po box never does look good.

    Not really. You don't need to use your real name. There are many companies that don't ask for I'd, normally the small family run ones.  Suspicion at custom checks arse when they see the word po box. It's not necessary to place the words po box as the receptionist will locate you by your name and you call in advance to see if they have got it. Tracking is important to. Watching the time frames in between action can indicate if your package is watched by the po po

    We do not like sending packages that are at all large to PO Boxes. We have not had a ton of problems with them or anything in the past, but they are definitely more likely to give us problems historically. Not sure why this is, which is why we will still ship to them. We do usually speak with the buyer at the time of purchase though and sometimes alter our refund rates based on the situation.

    I get all my mail to a PO Box. I'm very skeptical that customs pays any closer attention to PO Box vs house address. There's a very large percentage of people who get their mail to a box since there isn't residential mail delivery in many, many areas.

    Doing some advertising for my thread Mail Forwarding and Virtual Office Providers - Concept and Thoughts: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161081.msg1143747
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most Mail Forwarders and especially Virtual Offices will have very legit looking addresses, and any vendor looking to block these will basically have no way at all of doing this. As was mentioned before in this thread the possibility of interception will depend entirely on the Customs Agency in any country and their information, if they see that for example 50% send drugs to PO Boxes they have some external patterns to base that on to intercept the same type in the future. On the other hand I'm also fairly sure some countries with very lax Customs couldn't care less and will only pick something out based on if a dog has marked it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now this might not be in the scope for this thread but if we turn this concept on the head, vendors sending packages from a Mail Forwarder/Virtual Office would also be very hard to tell or block in any way from a customer perspective.

    Well I should be more specific in my question I suppose. I was referring to the USPS with domestic only shipping, using a real name and PO Box..

    <br/>
    This seems like it might be a bad idea but if your mail looks the same as all the others it shouldn't raise suspicion.
