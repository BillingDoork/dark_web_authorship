    Within the past month or so I have received 4 letters that have been torn slightly at the seam of the envelopes. These were not silkroad packages but were just regular business mail that is addressed to the same names I use for silk road (valid residents in the house). I feel that the post office has flagged all envelopes addressed to these persons in the house and are taking a "peak" into whatever letters they find suspicious. What can I do to stop this from happening without raising suspicion? I know they have no right to be doing this but I am absolutely sure this is what is happening. I'm nervous about my letter not arriving that is in transit right now as it is addressed to one of the persons they are taking a peak through their letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please help :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you

    My regular mail is often tampered with as well, there's always pinholes  poked into packages I order from Amazon.

    Not much you can do about the package in the mail now except pray.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing i can think of that you could do is take several of the pieces of mail that have been tampered with and bring them to the post office.  Politely make your issue known and inquire about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would probably wait to see if the piece of mail arrives alright before going to the post office but that's just me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are often holes in the packaging when items come from overseas and go through customs.  I understand there's a device they use to scan the inside of an item that requires making slight holes in the outter packaging.  Most of the people on this forum report the holes to be approx. 1/8 inch in diameter, but mine were closer to 1/4 inch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's any consolation i had such holes in several large orders from overseas and they arrived with no problems.  I wish you the best of luck.

    I would be worrying to much guys.
    <br/>
    The last deliveries i got came through a bit mangled - luckily i was at home so I was able to hear the postie raping my front door.
    <br/>
    Posties like to post like they like to fuck - as many at once as possible.( my mates a postie - and a dirty bastard too haha )
    <br/>
    Ive been in the sorting/delivery offices - trust me - these guys are not gentle!
    <br/>
    Ive also been told that they use large pincer like tong things for picking up bags etc and sometimes these pierce letters inside.
    <br/>
    Im no authority on international procedures but i have heard that some international packaging have holes in the outer envelope so that they do not swell and burst when there in the planes cargo hold and it depresurises.
    <br/>
    Ive know a couple of roadies who thought there address was flagged - I asked if they had orders not turn up or love letters from customs, if the answer is no to both I feel quite confident telling them to chill out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    peace.

    Those torn edges have nothing to do with postal workers investigating your packages. If a postal inspector investigates your package, you'll never know it. They have a special technique of fully opening packages by neutralizing the adhesive and then resealing them afterwards that leaves no evidence of the event. The only thing you need to worry about is your letter carrier asking you to sign for a package. If that happens, tell them that you don't accept packages from anyone that you don't know, and kindly decline.
