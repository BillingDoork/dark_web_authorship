    Hello Silk Road friends,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was just wondering - what happens with a controlled delivery if your never home??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I work 6am - 5pm M-F and also occasionally work Saturdays.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a CD attempt were made.... Could it have already happened unannounced to me??? Or would LEO likely try the CD @ 6AM or After 5PM??? ( seems unlikely to me).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way - it would be a dead giveaway that something is off kilter - as my mail is always delivered before 1:00pm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had a very small international shipment I've been waiting on for close to a month now with no arrival &amp; im just wondering what to do..... Obviously cant do much - but I would like to understand this situation....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thx SR crew - I expect to hear back from you :).

    I wondered about this, too. A "postal worker" arriving in the dead of night isn't exactly subtle. I have no plans to be home, or at least answering my door, when the mail is delivered, ever.

    I could see them leaving a note saying you have mail that needs picking up at a post office, and then arresting you there, however the fact that no LEO would wait at a post office 24/7 is what makes me doubt this happening.

    I might just add to what Heineken has already said which I believe would be the case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Who says the cops need to wait at the p/o 24/7? They could attach a tracking number to the package or have the p/o ppl inform them when the package has been picked up then raid your home later that day.
    <br/>
    Weather you have the (swapped drugs) or not when they come for a visit they got your arse on camera picking the package up....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What country are we talkin anyways? If talkin aus there are the last ten years of afp controlled operation reports for viewing search "Afp controlled operations" but be careful don't download any files through tor.
    <br/>
    Very detailed reports and very interesting to see how they do what they do... To better understand how to protect yrself.
    <br/>
    But I do the believe the best piece of information is found right here on the sr wiki "Write return to sender" on the envelope....
