    So I had a package shipped to me domestic priority. It arrived in my state, but when the package "Departed USPS Sort Facility" it went back to the sender state sorting facility. It says it was  "Processed through USPS Sort Facility." that's the most current update (form the 22nd).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else had this experience? How did you get you're package? or do you have any suggestions?

    When I was a Powerseller/Top-rated seller on a popular clearnet site, I saw this a couple of times in the three years I sold online. Your package was probably correctly sorted, but someone in the facility in your state either left it on the truck going back to the seller's state or read the address wrong and sent it back to the seller's sorting facility.  Once it got back to the seller's state, they noted to send it back to you which is why it was processed again and marked as such.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since it's Priority, you should have a status update Monday morning that it arrived back in your home facility if they don't screw it up again, with delivery Monday or Tuesday (if it arrives too late in the day to be put on a truck to be sent to you on Monday.)  If you don't receive it by Tuesday night, I'd definitely start worrying at that point.
