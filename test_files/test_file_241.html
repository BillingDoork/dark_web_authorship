    Hey everyone, new here on SR, and just a few questions about weed going through the mail in the USA :).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My main concern is being able to tell what's inside the package by feeling it. That is, if someone were to pick up the package would it be easy to tell it was bud? If anyone has ordered before and knows of a few vendors with A+ packaging that would be appreciated as well! What has everyone's experience been with ordering larger quantities (oz and up), and is it more risky or actually safer then buying g/eighths/qtrs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry for all the newbish questions, but I only buy weed from street dealers at the moment and safety is my main concern, and would like to try and order some ASAP if everything is in check :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other tips would be appreciated too!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    :)

    No, if they packaged it properly it should look like another piece of normal mail. I've never gotten less than a half oz (for quality testing) and even then you couldn't tell it was bud.
