    I was wondering, my seller said he was using DCN, and I was curious if I could get it and see how long the shipment will take to reach me

    DCN = Delivery Confirmation Number, also known as a tracking number. Some vendors will not give you the DCN but will keep it for themselves, just to make sure the package gets to you. There's a belief that constant checking of a DCN, especially if the package is held up in Customs/a post office can be a bad thing.

    its different than a tracking number somewhat
    <br/>
    <br/>
    its not intended to follow the package on its route
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what it is meant for is to confirm whether or ont the package was successfully delivered as addressed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    generally vendors do not give out dcn, for security reasons, and only provide them to SR during resolution in case a buyer claims they didnt receive their order

    Actually, a Tracking number and Delivery Confirmation Number are more that somewhat different. They are two separate and completely different entities that serve completely different purposes. The two terms cannot properly be used interchangeably as soooo many people incorrectly do.  Little wonder why so there's always so much confusion surrounding the difference.  Tracking is not DCN and DCN is not tracking.  USPS Tracking is available for EXPRESS MAIL only...no other class.  DCN can be added to  First Class parcels/Priority/Standard?Package Services/and APO/FPO destinations.   When you pay the 75 cents extra postage for DCN service you are entitled to notification of delivery or attempted delivery.  That's it.  I know most are used to also seeing DCN scans along that's mail's journey but those are consequential to it's only intended purpose and are there for the benefit of the postal service not the customer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    microRNA let me make a small correction to what you mentioned about a package's successful delivery.  Actually, DCN will only provide that the mail WAS delivered...it won't tell you WHERE it was delivered or TO WHOM it was delivered.  It will tell you the time and date of course and usually the zip code.  Everybody has at least one story of a pkg they expected showing as DELIVERED but not to them.  There are any number of reasons why a pkg can end up  delivered to the wrong person or address never to be seen by the intended addressee.  If the sender makes a mistake transcribing the shipping address ....very good chance it gets delivered to THAT address and not the correct one.  Sometimes  carriers mistakenly deliver the mail to the wrong address.  Sometimes the buyer inadvertently makes a mistake when  gives his shipping address to the seller and the seller ships to that wrong address.  Sometimes neighbors steal mail.  Sometimes Postal Workers steal mail.   If you use a independent mailbox rental store...the carrier can deliver the mail correctly but the box store loses it somehow.  has happened to me.  My point is DCN unlike Express tracking..is not going to give you any recourse if/when your pkg goes missing..it's not a guarantee of anything nor is it proof of anything.  Hey..waddya expect for 75 cents US?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS  gougeru..you can certainly ask the sender for the DCN. Many vendors give it to the buyer as a matter of course but those that don't are also well withn their prevue.  USPS rightly views the party paying the postage as their customer..not the addressee so by all rights the DCN more or less belongs to the shipper.
