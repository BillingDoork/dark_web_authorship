    Does anyone know if Auspost express post gets delivered with the regular mail in metropolitan areas? waiting on an Auspost express letter today, just checked and my regular mail has already been delivered today, wondering if the express post might arrive later today or whether that'll be it for today now and it'll now come tomorrow instead.

    They can come at different times. This happened to me also... the post came and there was nothing, then I went for a coffee and came back an hour later to find another bunch of mail had arrived including my express post delivery.

    I can only vouch this for a business address in the heart of an Australian metropolitan city.

    Depends on the size of the package. Letters and small packages usually get delivered with the regular mail but bigger packages are delivered separately.

    even with residential , it is quiteÂ  normal to receive regular mail in the AM and have a express post parcel dropped separately in the letter box in the afternoon.
