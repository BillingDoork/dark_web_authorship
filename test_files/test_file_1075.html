    A friend is driving to Mexico this summer and wants to take some party favors for personal use.  I know that trying to get back to the US with a stash is foolish - but do they utilize drug dogs on the way in to Mexico?  How risky is this really?  Any advice?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alternatively, is it a better idea to ship them to yourself and pick them up upon arrival?

    Any advice or anecdotes would be appreciated, thanks.

    Who smuggles drugs into Mexico? Just ask the tijuana whore your friend is going to rent, or any child above the age of 9.

    I live about 10 minutes from the border at San Diego/Tijuana. I have never really had an issue of being hassled by boarder agents. They are looking mainly for cash. Perhaps hide anything you want to bring in a place they wouldn't search for cash, just to be safe. In general though Mexico wants your tourism. I'd be more worried about being shaken down in Mexico. It is a very real thing that happens way more often than you probably think. Ask anyone that lives in San Diego and goes there often. Best of Luck and PM me if you have an specific questions on that particular boarder crossing.

    Your smuggling it the wrong way man. Lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think you should find an international vendor and have it shipped to the place where you will be staying. No hassle and you can have it sent before you go so it will be waiting for you there when you arrive.

    Exactly. Mylar bag your cash/drugs so no dogs find it. They'll never smell it.

    I've walked through...hmm i best not say, but once you pack whatever it is you have, forget about it, i'm serious about that.

    Sounds hard? If your a rack of nerves then dont, you'll be like reading a book.
