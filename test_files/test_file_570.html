    Their reviews seem to have gone down and they have no active listings right now, but if NextDayAir comes back, their packaging was amazing.  I wouldn't have guessed it was anything other than what it looked like without serious investigation.

    Mitanox and SKYY have the best stealth I have witnessed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although, when it comes to envelopes it's not really a big deal. As long as it is vac sealed and looks professional and "normal" on the outside it doesn't matter that much.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People bitch about Ivory's packing because you "can feel" the gear through the envelope. They still have a massively high success rate into Australia for example.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most countries sort envelopes electronically.

    Exactly my point, , not the most hollywood packaging but highly successful anyway.  I am not not dissing Ivory, more dissing fools that leave feedback saying that envelope packaging is not good enough because if an agent inspected it they would find the gear. The idea of envelopes is to blend in, not to be inspection proof.

    True. If it arrives, then it is a success. Anyway, will hopefully be able to add a comparison or two to Ivory's packaging shortly.

    SKYY-I think the way he does it is just great! It took me an hour to actually get it.

    DRamsterdam-Its not the best, but I have always got my orders and they never had pills crushed

    Schizofreen-I've always have gotten my orders from him also and think his packaging is great. But I have yet to see how it is within the las couple of months.

    Couldn't agree more with this, the whole meaning of "stealth" is to blend in. Ivory does this perfectly, his stats clearly back that up.
