    Okay so here's the background info:  I'm planning to open a mailbox at a small mom&amp;pop box service place.  they require my license and a bill or something with proof of address.  I gracefully managed to squeeze the info out of the guy that they need to submit this to the post office for whatever legal reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's where my case is a little unique:  My license has my former address printed on it and I have a hospital bill from december 2010 that has my old address on it.  If he sends this to the post office do you think they are going to research and find out that I don't live there anymore (i filed a change of address) and then take some sort of action?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I used to work for a place like this and we never sent shit to the post office; just kept stuff on file for our records.  So either my store didn't care about laws, USPS policy has changed, or this guy is over exaggerating his need for this stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there's always the option of just using my actual address to open this box, but i'd rather avoid that if i can.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone out there opened a box with a fake ID and fake documents before?  that might prove that the post office doesn't investigate shit for people opening private mailboxes

    Maybe try somewhere else? I didn't realise you needed a bill and a license

    well, i'm about to give it a shot.  if they don't accept this medical bill from 2011 i'll just say I have to to wait til i get something else in the mail (and never go back).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my guess is the jew (and I say that with the utmost affection) who runs the place will do whatever he can to get my money.  i'll post an update if anyone is curious.
