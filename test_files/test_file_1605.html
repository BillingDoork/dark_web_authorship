    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've bought some anti biotic which needs a prescription in my country from SR. The custom took the package for control but has then released it for delivery at my house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since i wasn't home when the package was delivered they left a note which is normal procedure that i can get my package at the post office which ofc requires my ID + signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question is, is it safe for me go and get it?
    <br/>

    I bot some Fentanyl (Synthetioc heroin)Â  from an SR european vendor, and here in US the PO asked for ID, so i showed my PO clerk my ID and got it. The next time i ordered from the same vendor and it showed up in my PO Box without having to sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are ALOT OF NEW, CONFUSING REGS for alot of US Postal offices, and it turned out to be alot of worry over nothing

    This has happened to me for an international mdma pack, and I was scared shitless to go get it, then finally decided I couldn't take the loss and went, and it was extremely easy and not sketchy at all.

    If you really think about it, they aren't going to keep police on hand at all times waiting for you to come in.
