    I hit a bong the other day (first time in 10 years as I'm a joint smoker) and 2 minutes later I hear the postie... No big deal until he rides up the driveway and toots the horn.  :o Except for the fact that the bong was kicking in and I wasnt expecting to have to sign for anything.
    <br/>
    I went outside feeling kinda sketchy and paranoid and stoned and did I mention really fucken paranoid.?...
    <br/>
    So there's this overseas letter I have to sign for and there I am, holding on to whatever I can to stop shaking, while I slyly check the name I used and sign for the letter.... The postie then banged on about this and that for a good 3 minutes so my paranoid self started thinking he was stalling me..... I was just waiting for the pigs to pull into my driveway.....
    <br/>
    What a fucken rush!
    <br/>
    Ironically  there were some xanny bricks in the package which was just what the doctor ordered and eaten straight away.
    <br/>
    Does this happen often? It's the first time it's happened to me and it was far from pleasant.

    This should never happen, talk to your vendors first and find out how they are shipping and whether it will need a signature. If they told you it wouldn't make sure they know about it so they can change shipping method!
