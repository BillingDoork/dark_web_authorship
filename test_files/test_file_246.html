    Hello SR, I placed an order a couple weeks ago, and my vendor informed me to be on the lookout for a 5x8 priority bubble mailer. Cool, no problem right? Well, in my PO Box, I had a pickup ticket, and I know for a fact my box is more than big enough for a 5x8 bubble mailer. I'm also 100% sure the pickup ticket was for the SR package. I decided to leave the ticket in the box, and sort of "stake out" the post office from a certain nearby spot. The next day at 11am or so, a LE vehicle rolls up, and out comes a canine. I haven't been back since. This was about 9 days ago.

    sounds like you avoided something bad!
    <br/>
    A little strange they had a dog if they already found your stuff. Maybe they wanted to check if more boxes where being used?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't mind me asking how much weight was it and was their anything unusual with the tracking?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also do you ever need to sign for those types of packages?

    if you don't want to say what it is or the weight for security reasons could you give an aprox street value? I also order things to a PO box and would like to know whats safe and what will get a stakeout.

    No worries; it was only an eight of some AAA bud, but it's cool. Surely not worth getting busted for. I have that po box under a completely legit second identity anyhow. My guess is it wasn't detected until it arrived at the final destination(my post office). The LE vehicle certainly wasn't a county/city cop, it looked more like a postal inspector, fed, etc. Also, another buyer left feedback on the same vendor, noting that his pack stunk horribly. It's all good  though, just wanted to share the story, really. I know everyone likes to pick on guys who are cautious with the pickup tickets, and I agree to an extent, but when it's blatantly obvious that they could have put it in my box......I'm not that stupid!!!

    They must of been their with the dog to confirm the package contained weed so they could open it.
    <br/>
    Btw regarding fake ids make sure you cover your photo in a thin laye of hairspray that a human will not notice but will make you a little blurry on a photo copier or edit the photo so your facial details are slightly changed. This will stop them from matching you face with real ID you may have. Which makes it easy for LE to find you especially if your in a small town.

    Neat tip about the hairspray. But wouldn't that plan get foiled if they were to simply take a look at the copy after they made it?

    Its not really something a human would notice or would really care about. It does not completely  blur the face out but it will lower the resolution enough so that a computer would not be able to match it easily. Especially if your in a large city will 100s or 1000s of other people might also show up with similar features.

    Makes sense. Assuming they would resort to such technology to bust someone using a fake id, unless you're using said po box to receive kilos and what not.

    My guess is a postal worker caught a whiff, called the postal inspector's office, they dispatched a LEO/K9, confirmed the contents of package, in order to obtain warrant. They won't ever see me again, though!!

    Find it hard to believe that a controlled delivery would be done over an eighth of marijuana - clearly personal use amount

    Not saying OP is lying, but completely possible that the events were unrelated

    the controlled delivery you avoided was the postal staff are going to hold you for 24 hours against your will until a single policeman arrived the next day with a dog to lick your face?
