    Hey all,
    <br/>
    I was wondering what you think is the largest amount of molly a person could ship/order while still being safe. At what point is an order too big to be worth it?
    <br/>
    It's way more cost effective to order in bulk, but if it'll keep me out of jail then of course I'll spend a little more money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks

    I don't think i'd open multiple PO boxes. that would be dumb.  idk if the post office checks back and forth, but if they noticed someone opened up several post boxes i think they'd get suspicious. Let alone the first item to be shipped to them is a bulky package from outside the country...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Besides, the PO box thing has been covered pretty well here and from what i can see, everyone seems to think it's pretty posse'.
    <br/>

    A TON of people have ordered 1oz+ and been fine.  If you're worried about it stick to 1/2 oz or less and you're fine for sure, but look around on the forum. people are getting huge amounts without batting an eye.  as long as you are careful, (use your real name, don't FE, check with your vendor to see if the package will require a sig, etc) you'll be fine. :)

    cheers mate.  wish you the best of luck in your enterprises! ;)
