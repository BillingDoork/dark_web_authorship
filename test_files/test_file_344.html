    No worries bro...I understand.  People die every day, perhaps we should all stop and pause for all the deaths that happen by natural disasters every day, week, year.   But I find it so much more fun to do this with a buzz.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So yes..... Customs JFK........did close down.   They started excepting flights in today.  Not many, but I am sure there were some mail deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Expect for all International order to be delayed..  There is a lot workers that simply can not get to work.  This was a complete disaster for the area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In all honesty............expect 3-4 week delay in all international packages:{

    Thanks and big ups for being a true SR HERO and answering my question and not being like that other dude! anyway,  their order was sent before this tragic hurricane touched US and should have been in customs prior to this it was send 2 weeks ago.  So, With that being said do you think this may shorten the time up? Since it was sent before all the closings and so on? I mean like i said i help get cancer meds for ill people that can not afford them and do not want to go to some internet pharm and get some knock off's.  I was just hoping i guess that since its been sent almost 2 weeks it would better their odds of getting the meds sooner than 2weeks but let me know and thank you for the info +! bro
    <br/>
    thanks in advance and to anyone else with insight into the question

    If its already through processing, than it should get to you faster.  But understand....there are workers that really can not get to work at JFK at the moment.  So it could sit in processing after being processed waiting for someone to deliver it.   Good luck....but my guess is a 2week delay.  Hope I am wrong for you though!!!

    If you google it there's a lot of information about postal activity, USPS, etc during and after hurricane Sandy. Fedex transportation was canceled on the 29th (Fedex handles USPS priority, express, and some first class mail packages) to major East Coast airports but resumed transporting on the 30th (my express packages were 1 day late because of this). I believe New York's airport got hit and it's taking them a bit to get back up and running...most of New York is experiencing delays when it comes to mail and I assume this might include ISC. There's a couple of articles about the mail situation in New York right now that you'll find online. Most East Coast mail and airports thats receive the mail are back to running except for a few.

    spanish inquisition,
    <br/>
    judging by your 4 posts its obvious you dont know shit bro and i have a life and dont have time to argue and write message about how bad i would love to pimp smack you dumb asses. but judging by the hero and other full members that have been around and got some respect well lets just say. I have a life and what i said was so right on about him living in his moms basement he couldnt even thing of anything too say and your trying to keep it going but i have more precedent business to attend to. Your a about as meaning full as the better part of you that ran down your mothers leg even though. she was a hooker and you dont know your dad, She did the best she could this is why your here getting drugs to cope with you co-dependency issues. So kill yourself and make the world a better place.
    <br/>
    have a wonderful night SI or LE i mean
    <br/>
    dont post in a thread that is not helpful information or when you ask a question every vet and hero member i am cool with which is a lot. Will not help you figure anything out,
    <br/>
    later im out bitch, like your mom was on the street corners until she met your dad for that $10 lay and 9 months later there you were because the plan b pill wasnt out yet and she couldnt afford and abortion. which i am against but with you it may change my mind
    <br/>
    lol
    <br/>
    fuck you deep throater:) night sleep tight and dont let your spanish bed bugs' fleas and the pubic crabs your mom left on your blanket bite :)

    Guru,
    <br/>
    what i said was true i did serve and although i did lose my temper. I am actually a good guy. I mean i was so offended the way he stereotyped me and called me a junkie. When in fact if you ask any of the vendors i deal with. I order cancer medication for a group of cancer survivors and i was very concerned because they need their medication. Now without getting into political issues. They are the unlucky ones whos health care was cut and can not afford what they need with the income they receive. I do not get high. As dealing with these last few smart ass replies IT about drove me to drinking(joke) but i am going to remove all of my posts that are a bit childish i agree after looking back.
    <br/>
    but Guru I do have a lot of respect for you as a member and your advice has always been spot on! your a great member of this community and i am glad you kind of checked me. but please do not disrespect my service to my country. I did 4 years over seas away from my family wife and new born son at the time. I do have 16 confirmed justified shootings that i know of confirmed, in those 4 years and trust me I did it only when my unit and myself was under fire. I was offered to be a scout sniper and do another 4 but i just wanted to have time with my family, but once again i do thank you for your words of wisdom.
    <br/>
    now do you know in your experience or from what you heard or what have you. Whats up with the whole situation. Isc is up and running and with all this my pack being sent out on the 24th or 25th and no track of course. How much of a delay I should expect its normally a 7 to 10 day thing and it did not make it today. So was just wondering if the Guru could share some of his knowledge with me i mean they dont call you the guru for just anything:)
    <br/>
    thank you in advance and like i said i am going to man up and delete the posts. I have never had an argument on here and i have been on over 8 month and plan on never having one again. but like i said  his stereotype offended me, i was tired and went off when i have much more self control than that trust me guru

    So you still haven't received the package? Packages can be held up in ISC for quite awhile sometimes (and they might be a little backed up right now especially because of the hurricane), there's actually a thread on one of the clearnet overseas pharamacy forums that is completely dedicated to wait times at ISC. Sometimes your package can make it through in no time and sometimes it can take as long as 2-3 weeks! Also, sometimes when I have a package sitting at ISC it will actually already be out of there but the tracking won't update until it says "Arrival At Unit" and has reached my local post office or sometimes it won't even update at all after leaving ISC and will show up at my door and then later in the evening when USPS does their scanner updating it will finally show "Delivered."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, I really hope you receive your package man! I know how much it sucks when the tracking/DCN shows no updates....I can't tell you how many times I've sat there and kept refreshing and praying to the drug gods to finally update the tracking!  :)

    Here ya go man (this is a clearnet link): http://www.pharmacyreviewer.com/forum/shipping-tracking-discussion/24421-ny-sort-facility.html
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a long thread that's all about the NYC/ ISC sorting facility and lots of people discuss their individual waiting times. There's a limit to how many posts you can view if you're not a registered user there so once you hit that limit just go into your "privacy" option on your browser and delete the cookies for that website and it resets the viewing limit.

    Hope you get your package!

    I removed my posts. After i looked back i realized i was just as wrong as the one who started accusations anyway, Still with the removal of my messages i still keep receiving negative karma. but i have not given anyone bad karma infact. i am going to remove this thread and hope the pack comes tomorrow. I just hope everyone can but the petty shit behind them and move on. Thats what i have done, hence the removal of my messages. like i said thank you for your best wishes on my pack arriving.

    I have removed my comments as well.  We both reacted viscerally.  I consider the removal of your comments as both a retraction and an apology, and hope that you will consider the removal of my post likewise.  I hope that your package arrives soon, and that no one suffered as a result of the delays.

    Well, my XpressPost tracking finally updated. To bring everyone up to speed it left CAD at the end of October... and finally scanned into the US on 11/4, at the Chicago International Hub. So it looks like my package was on a flight that was suspended when the storm came, and then rerouted to a new hub. I'm expecting another day or two delay to get to me, but I'm figuring the hubs might have a bunch of backlogged letters to get out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the good news is everything is finally getting up to speed again.
