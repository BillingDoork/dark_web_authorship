    This is an interesting read, but specifically, page 46
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Develop National Parcel Post Initiative
    <br/>
    "The National Parcel Post Initiative focuses on drug trafficking organizations using parcel shipping services
    <br/>
    to transport illegal drugs and drug proceeds. In 2012, 17 HIDTAs funded a parcel post task force. These
    <br/>
    investigations rely on full cooperation and full information sharing among all HIDTA member agencies,
    <br/>
    task forces, fellow agencies, and task forces in other jurisdictions.
    <br/>
    CBP, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the United States Postal Service are working
    <br/>
    with the Universal Postal Union and others in the international postal community to enhance the
    <br/>
    screening of international mail prior to its conveyance to the United States. The parties are developing the foundations for providing advance electronic data on international mail packages to allow CBP and
    <br/>
    TSA to perform risk-based targeting prior to foreign departure and entry into the domestic mail supply
    <br/>
    chain. This strategy will enhance CBP’s ability to identify, interdict, and disrupt the movement of illicit
    <br/>
    narcotics as well as stem the persistent threat posed by the smuggling of counterfeit pharmaceuticals
    <br/>
    and gray market goods. This approach is also linked to the Long Term Strategy for the Screening of
    <br/>
    International Mail and the Global Supply Chain Strategy."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I think they know..  ::)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?

    Most of the doemestic suppliers of MDMA get their gear overseas.  Someone is going to have to be ordering from overseas or procuring their gear domestically to serve to it to their customers domestically ;)  Sure you can synthesize MDMA in the states but it isn't being done much due to the laws.
