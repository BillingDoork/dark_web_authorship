    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am considering ordering from SuperTrips and I have some questions regarding the delivery process.
    <br/>
    On SuperTrips profile he states: "Be sure to be thorough with your address. Enter your REAL address and real name (unless you have a PO box). I do not vouch for shipments being rendered undeliverable because said 'fake' person was not connected to the address."
    <br/>
    Obviously, this concerns me, as I do not want to use my real name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In light of this information, what are your suggestions and ideas?
    <br/>
    One of mine was to ship it to my house using the previous owners name or perhaps one of his leasee's name. Is this a bad idea?
    <br/>
    Any techniques or tips that you are willing to divulge would be greatly appreciated.
    <br/>

    Just order it to your real name.  There's no reason some random person can't just ship you drugs and you can't be held accountable unless you sign for it or open it and don't report it.  Just wait till you get it, write return to sender on the UNOPENED package and toss it by the door for a day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This has been gone over dozens and dozens of times! literally!  use the search function, it doesn't bite.

    If you ship it to the previous homeowner and that person filled out a change of address form when he moved, then the mail could be forwarded to his new address.

    If it was the last apartment I lived in you can have it shipped to my name. I will not turn down a free package of drugs showing up in my mail box.  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want mail to be delivered to your place under a different name, start by signing up for stuff under that name. Free magazines, flyers, etc. Get that name on lots of mailing lists so you start getting junk mail to that name. Then order. The postman will be used to seeing that name and it is not yours.

    The reason they wait and not bust you straight away is so you don't claim to not know anything about the letter, If they wait the day they hope to catch you with it open and used. Or if you can't supply them with the unopened letter they know you have it and gives them reason to get search warrant, depending on how much you ordered obviously.

    Nothing personal, but whenever I see newbies, asking about tips re: deliveries, shipping etc. one thing comes to mind-LE.
    <br/>
    You could get a lot more info by being patient by reading through previous threads, doing a search, instead of asking outright
    <br/>
    what other people do in your situation, a lazy way of finding out, something LE are great at, using the easiest, most time consuming
    <br/>
    method. Be Lazy, and ask a question.
    <br/>
    PS. if you arent, like I said, I aint insinuating nothing, but LE develop patterns, and this is one of em.
    <br/>
    Good luck anyway
