    How does one acquire a secure drop point other than their own home? extorting your neighbor? fake name? real name? abandoned address? how does this work? what is the difference between a live drop and a dead drop? what are the other kinds of drops?  shipping to other people that you trust? shipping to other people you dont trust? shipping to a random abandoned house off 7 mile in Detroit?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What about if you are mailing illegal shit to someone else? go in the phone book and use a random guys name and address for the return address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    obviously a lot of this is trade secret, but can someone help me out with the basics that most people already talk about openly? I know nothing. Do your deed for the day and teach a newb, something usefull!  ;D

    A lot of people do it safely and effectively.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just don't send tons and tons of packs to your box. Once you get a couple packages, close it and move on to another store, preferably out of town. If the shipper ships correctly you will never have to worry about getting busted. As I said before, just don't go and get weight after weight after weight shipped to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't involve my friends in the equation. The more people know what you are up to, the worse. Remember - "loose lips sink ships"

    That makes sense. I move mostly personal amounts, but would like a few bigger orders so I'm not ordering so often because I feel like that is just as suspicious. I order a lot of legal stuff online so I don't feel like it's a huge deal, but I'm close to that 30 transaction mark here and I feel like it's time to switch it up and increase my security a little. Instead of a couple of halfs of weed a month, order 2oz every couple of months...same with other things.

    at this very moment, none. But soon I will have a monopoly on my local area. Although, I want to have a relatively small operation compared to what many on SR probably have. I just don't like the idea of having shit sent to my fucking house. one or two reliable drops is really all I want. Be able to burn them as needed, and pick up new replacement drops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not trying to be on some Breaking Bad type shit. Just spots other than my house. Also, what are common ways to obtain a fake ID without coincidentally knowing someone that looks like you? Whats up with  buying fake ID's via SR? How legit is that?

    I would like to hear from any one who has experience with using vacant addresses with packages. Every have a package not arrive at your abandoned drop point? also if the box was small was it put in the mail box? Or does it get left at the door as usual ?

    You have a few options, the best and smartest one is to pick out your best customer, let them know you'll give them a discount for getting the package themselves.  No need to mention the road or bitcoins or anything like that.  Just I have a dude from wherever the package is coming from, and I will hook you up if you start getting your own package.  Generally a 10-20% discount will pique the interest of the average reseller.  If this is not an option for you, well you're gonna have to get more creative.

    Honestly the best idea for this is to go to the largest church in your local area and get a church directory.  This will allow you access to one of the larger local databases of elderly individuals.  Eliminate all elderly who look to be physically fit, have a glimmer of liveliness in their eye, or people that you know to be active in the community.  You can then create a map of your local area of these houses.  If you spend a little time following the mail carriers (careful with this, don't want to appear suspicious) you can get a good idea of what time mail is delivered on a certain route.  Honestly if your business is successful enough you can just buy gps trackers and plant them on the mail vehicle in question.  You rotate the addresses and carrier routes and you could receive quite a few packages this way (assuming they are not too large to fit in a mailbox).

    The only other solution I can come up with off the dome is ethically reprehensible so I'm gonna leave that one alone.
