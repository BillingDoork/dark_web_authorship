    Pardon my noobness if there's a FAQ on P.O. boxes, I couldn't find one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. If opening a P.O. Box, is it even possible to create it with a fake name? Is there a lot of risk using your real name and picking stuff up from it on a regular basis?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Does the size of the postal box matter? If I were to get the cheapest, smallest one, could I just get packages shipped there and pick it up from the front desk without issue?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. Are there any companies that don't ship to P.O. boxes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. How much more recommended is shipping to a house compared to a PO box?

    1) Yes, if you had a fake ID to back it up with, and no, Ive done it
    <br/>
    2) just needs to be large enough to receive you packages and yes if the package is to large it will be at the desk, just do not sign for it.
    <br/>
    3) Yes usually the ones that use FEDEX or UPS
    <br/>
    4) I Don't, but that's personal preference.

    You will need two forms of (fake id).  Typically a govt issued picture id and also some sort of utility bill / insurance card etc.  They will make copies when you hand them over fyi.

    Yes I forgot the 2nd form of ID, Just simply take a copy of your utility bill and crop out the logo and print a new one with the info for 1st fake ID (MAKE SURE TO REPLACE ANY ACCOUNT NUMBERS WITH A FAKE ONE!!!!!!!!!), they don't keep the utility bill, they just use it to verify your 1st form of ID

    I'm pretty sure its a felony to use a fake id to open a P.O. Box. So you're already committing a felony based on the (small) chance of one of your packages getting intercepted and set up for a controlled delivery. Even then, how is a P.O. Box safer? they can just wait for you to come pick it up and they also have cameras at the post office. I dunno it seems like a waste to commit a crime and go through all that hassle when its no safer then using a home address  ???

    yes it may be extra felonies, however it means the cops have to stake out one more place before they get to your house, if you keep and eye out, choose a 24 hour post office, and walk in with your hood up or wearing a hat, you will be fine (don't have the POB in your hometown either. It just makes the cops have to do more and hopefully makes them make some noise. Just my .02 BTC

    There's people out there that, for whatever reason, are not able to ship to their home address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hence the need for an alternative.

    If you look around the forum, there are a few legitimate stories about people with P.O. boxes who get busted than those in houses, some are questionable but then there are some with actual clear net stories of receiving drugs in the mail by P.O. box and getting busted (weed, lsd to name a few). You rarely if not at all see anyone legitimate stories about people getting busted at home, only those trying to scare you. Whatever you decide, be careful.
