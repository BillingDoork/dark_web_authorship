    I usually get my priority packages on the 3rd day so if something is shipped on Tuesday I will get it on Thursday...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My new order was shipped today (Saturday) via USPS Priority and I'm wondering if there's a chance I might receive it on Monday? So Saturday, Sunday (Obviously mail isn't delivered Sunday but USPS still runs and has packages in transit), and then Monday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's been awhile since I've had something shipped on Saturday and had just been wondering/curious if there's a chance I could expect it Monday.

    Thanks guys :)

    Of course it runs on Sundays, USPS runs everyday...they just don't deliver on Sunday. I see packages processed all of the time through sorting centers on Sundays....not to mention I've had USPS Express delivered on Sundays.

    Mail gets processed 24/7 except for federal holidays. No deliveries unless express on Sunday however. If you ship something via priority on Saturday, you can expect it on Tuesday. If you experience longer wait times than the normal two days, ALWAYS be prepared for any kind of controlled delivery. deny deny deny. :)

    There is a very very small chance you will receive it by Monday. But anything is possible. Most likey if it was shipped Saturday you should have it Tuesday.
