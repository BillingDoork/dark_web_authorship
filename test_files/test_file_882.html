    As a very regular buyer I have noticed NL and Germany become very hot with Aus customs as of late.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It got me thinking, is there anyone out there that can offer buyer reshipping services (for a fee of course)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I.e I order from my fav vendor to a non-risk "reshipper" country and then they reship it to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A pipe dream maybe but if anyone can help me out here that would be great.

    Wishful thinking indeed. Unlikely you will get a system that actually runs smoothly. I can see a multitude of issues arising if a re-shipping service was offered, and it may perhaps cause more drama than it is worth. Honestly, you can obtain many of the same, if not better, products from non-flagged countries if you spend a little more time digging around the marketplace and these products are reasonably priced when comparing to NL/Germany/Canada. What were you particularly interested in sourcing? Shoot me a PM and I'll see what I can help you with.

    I had thought of this idea a few weeks ago(due to so many vendors unwilling to ship to Australia), I believe there are some people on BMR who offer this service, but I don't know if they would be willing to do it with SR vendors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The main problem I can see occuring is escrow/refunding.  If a package is seized or lost, I can see there being a lot of disgruntled people asking for a refund based on the value of the product, which would obviously put the reshipper at a severe loss given his profit margin will be magnitudes less than the value of the products hes shipping.

    the only thing I would be interested in are some beans from the NL or Germany, getting my hands on some nintendo/partyflock/mortal kombats would be pretty awesome
