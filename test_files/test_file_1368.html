    buddy of mine, working in a copyshop, told me that, besides those microdots (which you could stop by just take out the yellow cartridge), also different kinds of identification. he know, because the police once came to him, and it couldn't be for those dots. you can't really know for sure.

    you want to avoid sb linking different prints together, or link a print to a printer

    Look into the Dymo label printers... they use thermal heat on their labels to print, so none of those 'microdots'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Eitherway, you should be careful if you are shipping out of the house where you receive your orders... if that's the case, never have any vending supplies inside the house when receiving the orders, or ever if you can help it. Be creative and figure something out. If they're gonna bust you vending anyways I seriously doubt they're going to do it via analyzing the dots on your printer and tracking you down... Most vendors who get busted get busted for something IRL related or perhaps they get raided due to some faulty delivery and have vending shit in their house. Just some ideas to think about.
