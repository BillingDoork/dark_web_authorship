    Hey Folks,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had a request to ship cannabis from the US to Malayasia. I am leery that this can be done safely. I've shipped it around the country just fine, of course,Â  but never internationally. Anyone tried this? He wants a whole elbow, and I can't imagine how I could disguise that.

    DO NOT SHIP TO MALAYSIA !
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I say this only because peoples lives are literally at stake in this country for even minor marijuana possession.
    <br/>
    If you ship to someone there you won't know if the address that was given is legitimate. It could be someone's computer nerd kid or a political enemy trying to get hos opposition in dire straights. Either way, lives are at risk as Malaysia EXECUTES people for minor drug possession.

    Dear Wack,

    <br/>
    I am sooo glad that I asked. I wasn't inclined to do it, but your answer just sealed it. Thanks!

    I googled around and it's dreadful. Just dreadful.

    I forget how grateful I should be here in California. However much the Feds are cracking down, no one is going to be hanged.

    + 1 to you Heart for doing some research about harsh countries that are openly hostile to drug dealers and users in equal measure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When in Malaysia don't even think of drugs. Don't bring them with you even if you just go through in transit. Malaysia does not fuck around; when they say zero tolerance they mean it in the most capital way. My conscience wouldn't let me send anything that carries the possibility of death with it, especially when you're not really sure exactly where it's destined.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah, be thankful that most of us in the west aren't going to die for our choices.

    Just to comment as someone who has spent substantial time in KL (captial of Malaysia), drugs from a government level are very strict.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Trafficking has mandatory death sentence even for foreigners or expats. With that said though, it's only for what they deem trafficking quantities. I think like 14g of heroin and then it goes up from there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They do take small amount very seriously (maybe a couple G) if you get busted and can end up in a pretty shitty jail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To add some points to the other side, I know personally know people who take shipments in KL. Always small amounts (I'd never suggest sending weed there) and always very carefully. The reality is the Malaysian government has worse customs inspection than most western places (although getting better and still better than most of Asia). And they're still very unlikely to peruse random small personl shipments they catch in the mail (like every other country). On top of that corruption is pretty rampant in the police force and you'd be surprised what a bit of money will get you out of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, never ship anything over personal use. If someone wants to risk personal, that should be their choice just like every other shipment off SR, because it doesn't mean automatic death as they'd have you believe.
