    Bufferbox could be an alternative to PO boxes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They are currently being rolled out in the states and I think parts of Canada.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone can open an account and from what I can tell ID is not required.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buffer boxes are situated in GO stations, 7 elevens etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you signup you are given a shipping address, send that address to the sender. You'll be sent an email from Bufferbox when the mail arrives, this will include a pin code to open the box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have 72 hours to pick up the parcel arrives.

    I don't know why you would use this. It would remove any deniability you have.

    As pointed out, BB wouldnt solve anything. You'll just get pinched picking up your drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However if they had an option to put stuff into the box and set a PIN for another local person, that could revolutionize local drug dealing.
    <br/>
    I think DPR should open a BufferBox competitor. Call it DrugDrops.

    I like the idea of using BB because it saves you from using your name and address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if a SR package addressed to BB is intercepted, the authorities would notify the company... Question is, would they go to the lengths to set you up by still sending the notification email that your package arrived, then stake out the box for up to three days?Â  I find this very unlikely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's more likely that your package would just never arrive and they would send an email warning you or something, and maybe terminate your BB account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that said, yes, by entering the pin provided, you have incriminated yourself.
