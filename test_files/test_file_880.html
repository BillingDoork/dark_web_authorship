    When US customs is looking at packages coming in, which countries incoming have their mail scrutinized the most?
    <br/>
    I would think mail from the Netherlands, Columbia, Pakistan and maybe India? I'm trying to get an idea of which countries its better not to order from..

    Did you mean District of Columbia?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say any country that produces coke (peru, bolivia, colombia), and the axis of evil:   north korea, iran, sudan and most recently syria.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd add Israel to the list.

    I'm not an expert on the subject, so I can't really add any to the list(and don;t have time to research ATM, but I think you're right about India. I'm pretty sure alot of pharmaceutical grade ketamine and benzo's are manufactured there. I also think India is one of the only sources of etizolam, but that's not scheduled in most western nations, so an order of that wouldn't be of any worry.

    After making a thread about Portugal in the off topic section, it came to mind that their policy of decriminalization of all drugs might make them a red flag county. I don't think there are many vendors who ship from Portugal, and the red flag might be the reason, but then again, I have my filter settings to show 'domestic only,' so I'm not sure.

    Increasingly, many packs don't make it from the NL but nobody or few seem to get love letters for those packs.  It is possible the packages aren't making it out of the country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for US customs, what's more important is which customs center your package goes through.

    Can someone please elaborate on this?  Are certain US customs centers known to be stricter than others?  Are there a small amount on each coast, or many (one near each major city)?

    If the advertising budget doesn't justify it, you could always put it under R&amp;D, "The influence of MDMA on polar bears".

    I looked for the thread mentioned earlier and couldn't find it, anyway I don't have a clue what I'm talking about but I think China is. I know non-drug people that get love letters fairly often for legal things from China. I think it's hilarious.

    No I'd rather not, but yeah it's counterfeit stuff, but I mean I've even seen someone get a love letter for a single shirt. So they must just be opening lots of them.
