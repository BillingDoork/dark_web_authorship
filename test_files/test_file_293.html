    It depends on what time of that day the package was shipped and when that particular Post Office branch gets it's outbound mail picked up for the day. Location has a lot to do with it to. For example, anything coming out of Cali seems to take the full three days to reach me after the day it was posted. Mail coming from the same coast but in places with less volume normally only take two days after the day they were posted to get here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And the USPS doesn't hand off any mail to UPS. UPS hands off some packages to USPS for extra capacity because the USPS actually has Delta Airlines moving most of the long haul mail these days. It keeps UPS from having to maintain a larger air fleet full time.
