    Complete fool on youtube, this guy is so face-palmingly stupid plz don't do this:

    Packaging advice from this idiot showing off the packaging:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -hand written note was kind of cool, but dangerous because of handwriting analysis, prob wasn't done with gloves, many issues like they could match up a pen you have lying around that did this. Can also probably see it through the envelope. His vendor name is written right on there too wtf? Now if cops open it, they know who to go order off and social engineer into getting busted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -DMT came in a bulky rectangle, that certainly could be felt through the envelope. After the machines and being squished into transport trays, anything inside like a square will clearly be seen through the envelope when it arrives at destination customs, who may look at it but often they never check lettermail. It wasn't vac sealed either, though I dunno if you must absolutely vac seal DMT.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should've bought semi thick carboard paper rolls, or even used a lot of blank thick computer paper or magazine pages, then folded it enough so you only feel flat, bendy documents with no bumps. Could also have spread out the product more in the bag until very flat and vac sealed to as thin as possible. Glue the DMT bag with no scent spray glue or use tape to hold it in place inside the folded up packaging so it doesn't rattle around during transport.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And never sell to this fucking idiot and his youtube Hey look at the illegal drugs i got videos.
