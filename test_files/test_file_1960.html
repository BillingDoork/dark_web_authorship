    Hey everyone I have a couple questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. First of all do you have to encrypt your address with the public key when buying and how exactly do you do this? ( please explain in common English I'm not very smart)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Also what is the public key when I go to buy something underneath the address box is the public key what do I put for that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -thank you

    Despite what many SR forum members say, PGP is not an absolute necessity for making your order. Some vendors explicitly require it and may cancel your order without it. Is it a good idea? Absolutely, and you should get into the habit of using PGP early on. But if you're itching to get your first order in, you can just put your properly formatted (google 'USPS address lookup' for this) address in the address field. Vendors I've talked to have reported anywhere from 50-75% people not encrypting their address for orders. Trust lies within SR's admin staff and the hopes that SR's server will never be compromised.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as getting your PGP setup down, you'll want to check out the many PGP guides in the security section, as we have no idea what your operating system or software choices are.
