    Hey there,
    <br/>
    for the first time in my life, in a year of successful silkroad shopping two of my mails did not arrive in one row.
    <br/>
    I made three orders, one did arrive, the second one got shipped at friday and should arrive at saturday. The other mail got send on monday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every order was domestic. Every seller has a 100-99% rating and everyone rates the package as good. I don't want to reveal much of my identity, but It's in Germany.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I wait for two weeks. Still got nothing. Normally I get every mail at the next day. The slowest arrive was three days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does someone know why this could happen? A bad postman, the police? I thought the German mail is not under much control?
    <br/>
    All drug related stuff got removed, my drives are crypted by LUKS using a SD Card and a passphrase.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still I'm fucking paranoid now. Normally our mailbox is full every day. Now just 1-2 mails come in.
    <br/>
    Anything I should prepare for?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance

    if 2 no shows from 2 diffferent high rated vendors, its reasonable to assume your address is compromised and you should probably not have anything else shipped there.  however if you think theres a chance they didnt send this may not be true.

    Say goodbye to that drop address, clean your house, computer, phone car etc. and find a new place to ship. also Start having legal stuff sent to the address that may be compromised.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do u have tracking bro? did it make it into the states an clear customs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is whats good about when i have SR stuff.. Me and my Room mate and girlfriend, Always ordder Legal products offline, so there is always packages arriving from LEGAL places, and has for a few years..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So when a few packs every so ofton show that r from here.. Its nothing new, Plus my P O  is a small operation, and i know the mail carriers ,the main one, and her back up very well.. So its good to have NORMAL everday mail,bills,letters Orders from clearnet sites etc coming..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not just one thing, and that being SR goods...

    Rand came through just fine.  The b other vendor came through just fine too. Have told the first vendor I will let him know if the original package arrives. I am one happy customer.  I am not mentioning the vendors named because I would not want anyone talking advantage of such good customer care.

    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the same with me. Two orders. Both marked in transit over a week ago, both domestic in germany. No sign at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A letter from the same city and from a public organisation arived in 5 days. Usually it takes 1 day. But a postcard from another country arrived in 2 days. Seems like the domestic post is very slow or they are checking all the letters.
