    Hey all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A fellow SR user is undergoing a situation where a regular vendor of theirs sent an Express package (with tracking) that has been held up (no progress on tracking) since this past Tuesday.  What are the signs of a potential intercept at this stage?  Should they call the USPS and start a case with the Express mail department?  Or just keep watching the tracking number and hope that it sorts itself out?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice from anyone who has experienced this?  How long until you are notified and what are the possible reasons an Express package with tracking could just be held up in it's origin state for so long?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help is appreciated.  Peace.
    <br/>

    Mine was priority, so not sure if its much of a help, but tracking didn't update for about a week. i was sure it was intercepted. then all the sudden it was scanned into the sorting facility. Meaning mine probably sat in a postal dropbox for that week.

    I think the answer may depend on the content and the amount of it.

    You must have patience. It's good to have tracking but you should never check up on it, gives you unwanted attention

    now... if it has sat in CUSTOMS for that long..
    <br/>
    it's probably certain that they've opened it and gone through it.

    hopefully, you don't get a love letter. :x

    I have read that often times they do not scan it as having left customs.  So it is possible that it is on it's way right now.

    Thanks for your replies - I think if it comes today or tmrw I'm ok since it's only been in transit for 8 or 9 business days.  Still longer than usual which is like 4 or 5 business days.  It's a rather large shipment so I need to be safe...will likely refuse to sign for package if I don't recognize the mailman.

    Tracking shows when the usps scan it, they are lazy and dont always do it thats why sometimes no updates for a while.. As far as signing for it, if it was sent express u will have to sign, but just sign for it then take it inside write on it return to sender and then let it sit a day or so...if nothing happends dont worry, ALWAYS WRITE RETURN TO SENDER THHAT WAY U CAN SAY I DONT KNOW WHO THE FUK SENT THIS SHIT? WHY U THINK I AM RETURNING IT.

    Just checked tracking, scanned this morning at 2 AM as released from customs.  Kind of a weird time of day to get released??  I dunno I feel better about it now though cause it was only 3 business days in customs.  Vendor thinks everything OK.  Also OP sorry for hijacking your thread lol! but hopefully this info is useful to you too. :D

    Had a pack sit in customs at NYC for a week, then scanned outbound and delivered a few days later.   A week isn't unusual.
