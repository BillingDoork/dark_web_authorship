    So,
    <br/>
    Does any of you guys have experience with sending and arriving like 500 to 1000g of MDMA?
    <br/>
    I'm about to place a big order, but I need to know how they'll send it, cuz customs and no package can be irritating.
    <br/>
    Anyone of you guys know how to send or receive it?

    A missing package of 500 to 1000g is going to be more than a little irritating...

    I'd speak with your vendor and see how they handle such an order, if they want to divulge that information to you.  I'd just make sure that it's from an established vendor here who knows how to send bulk.  If they have a strong feedback rating, then your more than likely going to be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advice to you is to break that down into several addresses.  If your ordering that much, you obviously have people to sell it to so get a few drops and be patient.

    1kg of mdma is not a lot, two old school movie tape boxes could fit it. Send with overnight shipping if it takes 2+ days longer than it should dont bother picking it up.

    If you're in the US then you better assume that you're going to have a pack caught (don't go on "luck") and when it does you better expect the DEA and so-called "homeland security" to watch that package when it is delivered.  With GPS tracking it can be challenging to safely retrieve that package.  If you get caught then you're going to go to jail for a long time.

    good luck.
