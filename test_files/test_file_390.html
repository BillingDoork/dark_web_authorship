    I'm new and have been reading through the forum to learn about what to look for in a buyer, best way to receive etc... I was wondering if it really made any difference between USPS, UPS, FedEx?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I will be going to a friend's family's vacation house after Christmas. The house is normally used around holidays and thats about it. Packages are never sent there, although junk mail comes quite frequently. Would it be sketchy to order a package, what would be considered small, personal amounts, to the house under the owners last name? Basically I didn't know if it would be raise a red flag for a package to go to this house while people (friends) will be staying there.

    UPS/Fed ExÂ  = higher chance of being detected. Most vendors don't even offer use of them anyway. USPS priority mail is considered the safest I believe.
    <br/>

    As for the second part of the question, from what I understand, getting small amounts shipped regularly isn't even as risky as you would think. Your ordering one small package, one time, and that time happens to be the busiest time of the entire year for the post office. Your fine.
