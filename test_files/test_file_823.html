    I have near 20 orders on SilkRoad now, everything was fine until last time. I didn't get any of the packs since february. First of all, it's 2 packs with LSD from different trusted sellers, which i already used before with success, more then 1,5 month gone since i ordered this 2 packs from 2 different sellers. Then i ordered 1 pack with 5g marijuana and 2 more MDMA packs from diff sellers more then 1 month ago. STILL GET NOTHING of these 5 packs from 5 different trusted sellers! Wtf? Can police or post block all letters to my address? Anybody from Russia or another country have such problem last time?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shit, i didn't know, what to do. Guys, what is the problem, what do you think? TY for advises and sorry for my poor english, it's not my native language.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    definitely stop ordering drugs to that address, sounds like it's been flagged by customs. you could order something legit and cheap from china like a flash drive and see if it gets to you. then you can see if the package has been opened and checked by customs.
