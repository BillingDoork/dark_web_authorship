    You may or may not be getting PM's from folks willing to share or offer services for a fee, but it is generally frowned upon to discuss details about shipping on the forums.  The best suggestion I have heard is to buy some items from very reputable vendors and check out how they do things when your package arrives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've seen some varying degrees of shipping methods from my purchases and could easily begin shipping if I were to sell because of it.  Good luck.

    You probably won't get much from the general forum. That said, be sure to read the first page of this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39346.0
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tons of great information as well as, I'm sure, many things you haven't thought about. Becoming a [successful /safe /secure] vendor takes some serious though and  isn't a walk in the park :)

    I'd suggest getting a vendor account and selling locally (through SR) to build some rep. Once you have a base and reputation it will be easier to get help from other vendors on doing things internationally or on a larger scale.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously nobody is going to give you shit on a silver platter, and nobody even knows if your LE looking for more info (or whatever other conspiracy theories people have). Additionally, the last thing I want to do as a vendor is give good solid advice to someone who's just a straight up SHITTY DEALER!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basic SR shipping expectations are listed on here somewhere. Follow those to start and improve from there.
