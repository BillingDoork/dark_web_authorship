    Does it raise any suspicion for packages to be coming through to the same name at two different addresses within the same zip code? not sketchy if the packs get shipped on separate days, but what if both packs with different addresses but same name come through the sorting facility the same day?

    I wouldn't worry. Plenty of people have a home address and a business address, or a residential address that they use for letters and regular mail and a PO box that they'll order more valuable packages to. It might be a little strange if the name is unusual and the addresses are two PO boxes, say, but in general I don't think you have much to worry about. As long as the addresses are otherwise legitimate (ie as long as someone with that name has received mail there before) you should be fine.
