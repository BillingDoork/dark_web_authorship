    theres been alot of discussion about shipping priority lately and how to ship as a vendor or a future vendor. now alot of the question (mainly in the noobie section) just require a simple amount of research, however these questions and topics do not.  here are a couple ways ive shipped and been shipped to and pros and cons of each. if anyone could help share some wisdom that would be great.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    alot of vendors ship flat rate priority because its really easy and there are 2 ways to do using the anonymous blue drop boxes.
    <br/>
    1.) print labels off the usps website and tape them to the package.
    <br/>
    thats a good way to ship but the only problem is paying for the postage. you would need an untraceable paypal account or an untraceable prepaid debit card to pay for it. ive done reseach and seen a few listings for both of those on the road but none currently. so for this method the question is how could you obtain a card or paypal account without using the silk road?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2.) just use stamps which cant be linked to you and write the address only problem is tracking. if found through research and advice that you can obtain tracking stickers from usps and tracking comes free for priority. sounds amazing right? wrong.. its sparked debate that the minimal amount of 500 labels that you can order for free off the website can be tracked to you. of course you use a real address for the pack of 500 and usps  but the debate is that an individual tracking label put on a package can be scanned directly back to you. when responding keep in mind they make and send anywhere from 10,000 to infinite labels out a day and the minimum order is 500 labels
    <br/>
    <br/>
    keep in mind dont give information on how you ship. just information on what works

    Everyone who might want to post in this thread should just keep in mind in doing so that LE reads these forums so you don't want to give away anything TOO specific about the secrets you might have for getting things shipped successfully.

    Im never one to type in CAPS, but this is so important, and tooo many vendors do not employ this..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) WEAR GLOVES WHEN HANDLING AND PACKAGING YOUR ORDERS/PRODUCT.
    <br/>
    2) WASH DOWN ALL GEAR AND PACKS WHERE APPLICABLE, ex. WASH WITH SOAP, ANY AND ALL VAC SEALS AND OR MYLAR/MOISTURE BARRIER BAGS, ONCE SEALED AND READY FOR POST.

    Totally scout, but sadly ive gotten so many packs that either had a visible finger print on them, or the triple sealed vac bag/mbb would faintly smell of product, from transfer odor. I understand that the amount of time and effort that would imply, but its imperative to the safety of the seller and buyer alike.

    Definitely worth the extra time and effort if it means that the packaging (and shipment as a whole!) is safer!
