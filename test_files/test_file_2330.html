    Feeling pretty sketched out right now...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered 50g of Methylone on Tuesday and it was marked in Transit yesterday. Today, I received a call from my mail cache. Now this is not uncommon as they have called me before to notify me that I have a package arrive at my PO box, but the fact that it was possibly sent overnight scares me... Is it normal for vendors to ship out overnight? In any case, I don't plan on going in to pick it up until tomorrow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not really sure if I 50 grams would be enough of a quantity to alarm any LE, but I figured it didn't hurt to take as many additional precautions as I can.

    Knowing your country would help. Legal situation, etc.

    I must say though, next day delivery, even domestic, is really a bit sketchy, unless the vendor happens to be really close to you and your shipment happen to make the day's mail run.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure you not expecting something else to that address too?

    I live in the US and Methylone is definitely scheduled.

    It may very well be a different package.

    Should I name the vendor that I got it from or would that be in bad taste?

    Yes, US to US order. It's one of those independent mail services that accept every mail ie, UPS, USPS, FedEx. I'm thinking after this that I'll just go to an actual USPS PO box though.

    CharlieandFriends. I've made several transactions with the vendor (10g and 20g) but he's relatively new. He mentioned that he would include tracking so I would assume he sent it out express. I've been a buyer for about a year now and I've never received express in one day.

    It's hard to tell. I know that some of those independent mail processors get their shit really fast because they get it from dedicated postal handoff centers so they can be a day faster than usual. Especially if they have their own ZIP+4 code.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if that vendor happened to ship the same day you placed the order and it was early enough, there is a chance that you could really get it this fast.

    I use overnight delevery all the time for elbows of green and have been for the better part of 5 years.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I trust overnight because there really is no time to look into the package or play the "guess whats inside" game
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I send it out and by the time I'm having lunch the next day its already being delivered.

    I love overnight!

    I should have explained that i only ship to people I know, therefor there really is no risk about the receiver being LE... On here tho is a totally different thing...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Risk is much higher... but none the less if i am sending to a friend.. ups works just fine

    I think the fast arrival is a good sign.  If it was intercepted, they need to get a warrant and make CD plans.  That would be a miracle to have it happen that fast.  Just my opinion!

    Well yeah if that is the agreed deal then I agree. But in his case no fee for overnight was paid and it seems a random vendor purchase. In that case overnight would seem sketchy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course if you know the vendor and they offer it then UPS is a fine choice, even better than FedEx imo...

    When CDs occur the postal inspectors are organized in such a fashion as to not cause any delays, so that in theory you shouldn't expect there to be any difference between a CD and a normal delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some people say high speed deliveries are less likely to be intercepted. I do not concur, that is just one element of the picture. There is a CD calculus which depends on two variables:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A: The number of packages being processed. High speed deliveries like overnight are a much much smaller pool than regular standard mail.
    <br/>
    B: The time they have to examine the packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So they may have less time, but they may have even less packages to analyze per minute (psm) to analyze than they do with five or ten times more time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So; my advice is to trust your intuition. I take it this P.O box is not registered with real identity papers? Is the phone they used to contact you a burner? Has the vendor used a fake return address? If the first two are correct, maybe you can relay the package to elsewhere and observe what happens. If the first two are wrong, but the vendor has a real return address, then you just RTS (return to sender). Otherwise your choices seem to be to pick up the package blindly or obtain a courier.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The postal inspector, if he was looking at your package, would observe two things immediately. 1. That the package was sent to a P.O box, and 2. That it is fast delivery. Those are two red flags as defined by the informants who have reported to SR from USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I think you're correct to procrastinate, but others may have other ideas. If you can afford it, I'd just drop the entire thing and call it a loss, otherwise you are back to the choices I mentioned above it seems. Think it through, look at all the angles, there might be something obvious we've missed to date.

     Moment of truth. If I'm not able to post in the next few hours, it's safe to assume that it was a controlled delivery and I may very well be under custody.

    If you go this route, then remember those sage acronym "STFU". It is meant kindly, for your security. . Also clean out your entire dwelling of any contraband, SR related information on HDs, disks etc before you go.

    Here is a good case study of a guy who did it wrong:

     A FORMER Hobart nightclub owner had a cocaine package addressed to his dog and delivered to his house from Victoria, a court heard yesterday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Builder Samuel John Morse, 26, of Kingston, pleaded guilty to drug trafficking yesterday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He was nabbed in May after the Kingston Mail Centre informed police a suspicious package had arrived.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Drug squad detectives investigated and discovered an ounce 28 grams of cocaine in the Express Post package addressed to "Benji" Morse.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They replaced the drug with sugar, prosecutor Patrick Dixon told the Supreme Court in Hobart, and waited.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Postal workers tried to deliver the package to Morse's address and left a calling card when they discovered he was not home.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He picked it up the next day and opened it during the drive home.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After finding it contained sugar instead of cocaine he threw it out the window, Mr Dixon said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Drug detectives arrived at his house a short time later.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They learned Benji was Morse's dog and the package was the second such delivery he had ordered in recent weeks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The first ounce costing $7500 arrived undetected weeks earlier, Morse confessed, after he and three friends put up the money and he arranged for a Victorian-based dealer to supply the drug, which is not widely available in Tasmania.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Defence lawyer Jim Saric said because Morse was the one with the drug dealer contact, he agreed to place the order and planned to store his quarter-ounce share away for future use.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     &lt;IMPORTANT&gt;
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Police could not have charged him over the first ounce had it not been for his confession, the court heard.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Mr Dixon said that Morse refused to name his dealer or provide the bank details he had used to deposit the money until they told him what he was being charged with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     &lt;IMPORTANT&gt;
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Morse had recently sold his share in CBD nightclub Halo for $80,000, Mr Dixon said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Mr Saric told Justice David Porter that Morse was very remorseful and had undergone drug counselling during which his counsellor determined he was unlikely to take drugs again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Justice Porter was told Morse, who was ashamed of what he had done, had led an exceptionally industrious life and was in every other respect an excellent contributor to society.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The judge ordered he be assessed for a community service order suitability before bailing him to reappear for sentence next Thursday.

    I won't disclose specific details, (for the sake of the vendor) but nothing was out of the ordinary. I'll have to stay on my toes for the next couple weeks though.

    So it was the actual package from a SR vendor?  Did you examine the package and see if there was any signs of opening?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another assurance would be contacting the vendor and see if it was possible from his location to get to your location just within a day.
