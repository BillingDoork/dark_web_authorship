    I was at the post office and asked them if they had first class stamps so i could just use a drop box (suboxone strips doesn't take much more that a card), about how first class can be up to 32 oz. but cost 20 cents an oz over the 1st oz which is 45 cents. so if i had a 2 oz letter i could just drop it off with 45 cent stamps on it and it would go first class? anyone have any experience with this?Â  She had real trouble explaining how it would work, and since i said i mail a lot for eBay she told me to just use the online PayPal thing.. obviously not and option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any help or experience would be appreciated, i want to do first class so my customers don't have to wait.

    Do a little reading and your questions will be answered. The limit on first class rates is 13 oz.
