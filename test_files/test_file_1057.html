    So I made some orders and both vendors had the shipment out on May 1st ( 4 days ago ). One of them is located fairly near me... I expected the package on Friday ( 2 days ) because he was so near but its Sunday now and still no sign of either package. Should I be worried? Did they get seized? I'm located in NY. Idk if thats affected by the ricin delays  :-\

    Considering its 2-3 business days &amp; he sent it out on a Wednesday, they probably don't ship over the weekend, so if anything, it should come in tomorrow.

    Ever heard of shipping delays? If you don't get a package by NEXT wed then you need to START a conversation with the vendor. NOT BEFORE!!!!! The vendor can do nothing to help you out right now.

    Try not to order two things at once though next time. There are always delays and stupid errors that happen. I am having a legit package take way to long atm as well.
    <br/>
    Also you must consider that, unless the vendor specifically told you otherwise, they could have packed it and marked it in transit then ship next day.
    <br/>
    Many things to consider. A week is when I'd say hummmm...

    Bro you must be a newer buyer from SR. Priority does not have to take 3 days, It can take all the way up to 7 somestimes like Jack off said.. Its not very much but it can..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now Have you considerd that your vendor just marked it 'In transit but really didnt mail it the time he said?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or do u have tracking? to see both?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your House Is not Flagged bro, if youv orderd U.S TO U.S then i wouldnt worry, Shit happens sometimes man.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You know your house is Flagged  for sure unless you get a LOVE LETTER, But if it were to never arrive after next week, then its clear your vendor s stealth sucks and it probley was intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about this as well, we have fucking Niacen and terrorists shit going on, do u really think they LE main focus is your few items of drugs? Which by the way you of course know you never order no drugs and someone must be pulling some asshole joke on you if by chance it were to happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv had packs (3) come from NY as of lately with no issue buddy..   Again remember if its some small amount and u havent oderd half ounce of coke or heroin or more, then if they did by SMALL chance pick up on your parcel out of the MILLONS that come through NY being a main customs port and mainling center if im not wrong then it will be thrown away..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please do keeep us updated though. DO u know and trust the vendor? Or have u never used him before?
    <br/>
    Iv used vendors with great rating but shit stealth, that just the parcel alone looking screams 'IM SUSPICIOUS !!!" LOL
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It does seem little longer, but i feel it will all be alright.. PLEASE TEL ME ITS NOT FROM SOMEONE U HAVE TO SIGN FOR IT&gt;?

    Weird shit happens with USPS sometimes.  Get in touch with your vendor, ask them to track it if they can (using Tor to get to packagemapping.com) and to give you the results.  If no tracking is available, just sit tight.  Don't sign for anything.

    One order was from a well known vendor with good stealth, the other one was for less than 5 grams of M1 from a new seller. I'm guessing the new seller fucked up on the packaging, and maybe they're stopping all packages to my name now. Unfortunately the new seller has been inactive for the past 5 days so I can't get his tracking, while the well known vendor sent it with priority with no tracking. tomorrow would be the 7th day.

    Hey Flower, I know what it is to be in your position....the stress of wondering what is going on with your mail is enough to drive you into a mental institute. Let me tell you what happened to me in April of this year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered 3 packages during Week 1. All three were priority packages and two of those were from vendors I had ordered from several times in the past so I knew more or less how long it should take.
    <br/>
    P1 was shipped out Wednesday of W1, P2 was shipped out Friday of W1 and P3 was shipped out Saturday of W1.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the packages are traveling at the same speed, what time will the first train arrive in Philadel...no just kidding.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I started checking my mail, this is a PO box by the way, on Monday of W2 thinking "Yeah, something will be here." Nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By Wednesday of W2 when nothing had arrived I started to sweat. I kid you not, I started looking for helicopters and cars following me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was not until that Saturday, Saturday of Week 2 that all three packages were in my mail box simultaneously. Let me tell you, that FREAKED me out. I had been checking my mail box every day starting the Wednesday of W2 so I knew for a fact that all three packages were dumped into my box that Saturday of W2. But guess what? I'm still here and I got everything I ordered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Moral of the story: I know it is difficult but try not to let it worry you too much. You'll be fine. Our postal system has quirks just like any system and it is bound to cause delays. Try to relax bud.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep us updated and I wish you the best.

    Well I had a order take 2 weeks one time. Geezus! Vendor was unorganized. Couldn't find the tracking number and kept blowing me off..So what ever , I'll wait.. Till it arrived when it all made sense.. The vendor used a bubble mailer, with 4 stamps on there and name addy all that printed out and taped on the envelope. DURR no wonder no tracking number and guess what?  wasn't shipped priority as he said and packaging/stealth was complete crap.  Just in some plain bubble mailer with stamps on em.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Clearing out would probably be a good idea, just in case. If it hits the 2 week mark something messed up. Given that he's MIA for 5 days, there's no way of checking and that's a long time. If it hits 2 weeks and vendors still not around, send in a ticket and ask if something can be done? Doesn't hurt.

    I put in a priority order last Friday, and today is Wednesday with no package. This vendor usually gets my stuff to me in 4 days at the max.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm seriously hoping I don't have to wait an entire week to get my goodies. I half expected to get my shit yesterday  :'(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anywho, what's up with the OP? Did his shit ever arrive or is he in jail now?

    Alright so your shit never came... I'm guessing LE didn't either? My guess is that the new vendor never sent anything and the trusted vendor with good stealth fucked up the address... or you fucked up the address... or the sorting facility was having a bad day... or it was returned to sender for a bad label... or who really fucking knows dude. My point is that you didn't get a love letter, you didn't get a knock at your door, and you furthermore didn't have any warrants served on you or your property. They aren't watching you either. Unless you were formerly a vendor or show some strange promise of providing a better case, you would have heard something. Call me crazy but I feel like you would have heard SOMETHING. Endnote though don't give up on the road. get a p.o box or find a different house or something. It's really not that hard and is something that unfortunately comes up pretty often I feel like. Just my honest thoughts.

    i just wanted to chime in and say i'm waiting for a package right now from a legit clearweb site, that was shipped priority, and should have been here 2 days ago, max.  i think there is something going on nationwide that's causing the postal delays, everyone seems to be having them.. also i have noticed that i haven't been getting as much regular mail either.  i think USPS is just real slow right now.  hopefully they'll pick up speed but we may just be finally really feeling the effects of the cutbacks they've made.  patience is a virtue...  but it's so much easier to patient when im high..  :(

    The country has been on like, a month long disaster string. The USPS may have their motto about rain, but it doesn't say anything about tornados. I was talking to the mailman the other day about it, and at least to him the mail is just back breaking lately. It's not so much volume, its that the disruptions ultimately mean you get a quieter period, but then EVERYTHING that has piled up comes in... which I've noticed on some other things too. Some days I won't get anything, others I'm getting more than normal, as opposed to the standard spread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The secondary outcome to this, is that while the weather may not be IN your respective cities, the mail that is destined for there may come in larger waves than normal. I've been having issues with more than just priority, everything has slowed, including fedex packages from newegg. FedEx had a notice on their site last week after the Moore incident, I don't know about this week I havent really kept up with shipping this week after memorial day... recovery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But just keep in mind, there are things that can stop the flow of mail, and it doesn't have to be local to you. Local mail delivery still has non-local mail to deliver, and its no more or less important than you (and that includes express too, which I've been having delays on since late February). Post office aint what it used to... that army shrunk, and now the wraith of Al Gore and global warming is just making it harder. At least theres no manbearpigs eating the mail, then it'd really be tough.

    Same here. I had priority packages that usually took 2-3 days to come that took a week. It's indeed very strange. And what's even more strange is that it seems that it is sort of global, and not tied only to the US, or at last this seems the trend if you look around.

    As I said earlier in the thread, I had an international half pound make it in two days to a customer from a flagged country while everyone else was experiencing these issues.  Just this week I've had some slower mail though.  Not everything, not even half of my packages.  Just some of them.  What makes you think it is global?  I thought it was our overworked under budget USPS.

    Just an impression by reading other threads. Some people have reported packages from the UK (that has always been a not-so-hot country) not coming or taking much more than before; the problems in Sweden, other reports of more waiting times in the EU in general.

    Some times it just depends on how lucky you get with what post offices your packages bounce through before they land in your home town.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive had the same vendor send two different packages the same day from different locations back when vendors gave you tracking #'s (Dec. of 2011), one arrived in 3 days, the other sat at a package facility for 7 days and took another 3 to arrive (10 days total).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plus the time of year matters too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The holidays and Valentines day especially.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Right now everyone is gearing up for summer time, so I wouldn't be surprised if everyone is seeing some sort of delays as people en mass order random things to prepare for summer.

    Yes i am waiting on an international order from a trusted vendor. After reading this thread
    <br/>
    though, I have hope that the reason it has already taken double the normal time it takes from this
    <br/>
    vendor is due to the USPS once it got in. I have many orders with the vendor and they were so
    <br/>
    consistent it wasn't even funny,fingers crossed.

    We just had one sent USPS Priority that took 6 days to arrive. It was delivered just fine and was totally straight, but after examining the tracking (we don't check unless asked) it had bounced around two different WRONG cities before ending up in the right place. We also had a second package take 5 days, going to one wrong city. We have spoken with USPS on a few different levels (Carrier, Store Clerk, Manager on Phone) and all have echoed the same idea that they are just a bit behind on their day-to-day routine and things are occasionally getting backed up. We were also told that many of the carriers currently are "stand-ins" that were not trained to the same level a new hire by the USPS would be. This is obviously all a result of the budget cuts. We see this knowledge as meaning two things. 1) If your package isn't quite on schedule it is not outside the normal. Tracking also seems to be a bit on the fritz. 2) The postal workers all seem to be very overloaded, we HYPOTHESIS (NOT A FACT) the idea that many of the workers are not trained as meaning that perhaps more packages will get through than typically would, BUT ALSO there may be errors in the mail system that wouldn't usually happen. We think that these risks can largely be avoided by using MBB's and having your labels printed so there is no room for error in reading bad handwriting. All in all we think it's best to avoid panic over packages taking a day or two longer than you might expect. Ebay and Paypal shipping forums echo this sentiment.

    Bumping this thread as I play the waiting game.  This is about as long as I've ever had to wait and even though I told myself I wouldn't I'm starting to get nervous.  Vendor marked in transit last Saturday 6/15 even though they said in their profile shipping Monday - Friday.  So I want to assume it went out 6/17 Monday.  It's Thursday 6/20 now and nothing.  My last delivery first class was faster than this delivery priority and that was cross country.  WTF

    Going on a week for me too. Most priority packages from this vendor take 2-3 days. In fact I had placed a separate order at the same time to be sent further from my location by 1,500 miles and they received it in 2 days! Go figure.

    I'm sure it'll turn up eventually. If not I would look into adding thrusters to your house so that you can escape to the moon if need be.

    Well quick resolution for me.  It wasn't the USPS dragging ass after all.  But instead it was the USPS making a mistake.  On Monday I received a package and also a note in my box saying there was another package available for pickup that wouldn't fit in my box.  But when I went to the window and tried to get it, they looked and couldn't find anything for me.  They said it was probably for the other person who has a box with the same last name as me lol.  So I accepted that since it was so soon after the vendor had marked in transit and I didn't think it would actually be there so quick.  But it was there!  It was in the post office since Monday and I kept wasting time and gas money driving over to check my box until I got fed up and messaged the vendor today who confirmed it was also at the destination.  USPS does it again!

    Not sure if it's global, but here in Canada I've been waiting for a domestic letter for over a week (7 business days in transit). Every day I get home after work and check my mailbox. Every day my heart sinks a little.

    I wouldn't worry too much... I just had a package come in last week that can only be described as being in the void for 3 weeks.

    Looks like it's a common problem. Three orders so far by priority, coast to coast on two of them came in 2-3 days. But one is on about 10 days but the vendor is having usps issues in the area so it's not just me.
