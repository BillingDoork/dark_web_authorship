    I'm going to a festival in Croatia in september, I'm originally from the UK, so don't have any contacts in Croatia, I was wondering if anyone had any advice as to how safe it would be to order (MDMA, maybe weed)? We're staying in an apartment so my plan was to have it posted there and call ahead, saying that I'd forgot some personal items, and had had a friend post them? How dangerous would this be? How many days in advance should I place the order. Has anyone had any experience with this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks x

    You heading to Dimensions? If so, I am heading as well. Its shaping up to be a great festival and the line-up is class :-)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't bother going to the expense of ordering stuff from SR and getting it sent there, when you will more than likely get anything you want at the festival.
    <br/>
    If you did order, you would end up being anxious while waiting for it to arrive and if it didn't get there in time, you'd still end up spending more money buying stuff anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am bringing acid with me (it is fairly safe to bring that on an airplane) and hoping to be able to exchange that for MDMA with people selling it at the festival.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whatever way you get your gear, have a great time at the festival :-)

    My only tip would to not go around asking everyone in a hurry. Talk to people for a bit and if you think they'd be cool with you asking, ask them.
    <br/>
    If you walk up to people in a hurry asking if they have stuff to sell, they may think you are undercover police. That's how I do it anyway!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have a blast anyway dude!

    I'm sure you will find what you are searching for on the festival!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there are ah lot of people which sells some good stuff there, but watch out, don't give money away if he says he comes back with some goodies in ah few minutes, this people are scammer!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but @ dimensions(i think this is the festival you are going to) you have not to search ah lot!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just watch out if some people are going arround and whisper: xtc....mandy...or whatelse!
