    Hey guys!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok so I'm going to decide and buy either a PO box or UPS Mail box service tomr and I want to make a pros and cons list for the two of em and see if anyone else may know or think of something I may miss. I am going via external Box route because 1) the home address I have access to got a seizure letter sent to it a while ago and I think more time must pass before I even think about shipping something to that address again and 2) The main purpose for this mail box is a small start up business as well that will have lots of legit domestic and some legit international packages of all shapes and sizes go to it. So I need the box either way. I will not be using fake ID's/names or anything thats a whole nother felony I dont want to mess with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the pros of USPS Box
    <br/>
    1) Much cheaper
    <br/>
    2) Not ran by private business and assuming they would need warrant to open it at local PO (if they didnt do so at customs)
    <br/>
    3) Much larger volume of packages in the facility blend in better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Con's on USPS
    <br/>
    1) Its a PO Box this may or may not affect the customs agent and how they evaluate the risk factor of package/letter
    <br/>
    2) No 24 hour access
    <br/>
    3) Only one name can be used to on the box
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pros of UPS Mail Box services
    <br/>
    1) Its a street address that can be written as a suite or apartment # ( looks like a business or apartment address)
    <br/>
    2)Can use up to 3 personal names and 1 business name
    <br/>
    3) 24 hour access (maybe this is beneficial to get packages after hours scope out the place etc)
    <br/>
    4) UPS signs for all packages and leaves them in the mail box area for you to get at your will
    <br/>
    5) A have a business partner  that can apply for a job at the same location they are always hiring. *this is a big maybe though obviously
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cons of UPS Mail Box services
    <br/>
    1) Way more expensive 1 month here is the same as 6 months at a USPS PO Box
    <br/>
    2) Private company (assuming if a package looks shady at the UPS store or smells they would open it, notify police)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thats all I can think of for cons on UPS but I'm sure there is more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok with that being said what do you guys think? Is there anything I am over looking here? Let me know what you think I would really appreciate it.

    Couple things I want to note about the USPS PO box. I have one and it is for legit things, nothing illegal whatsoever goes into it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every post office around me has 24 hour access to your PO box, are you sure your post office does not? Also, I get mail to my PO box with all sorts of different names. Not sure what you mean about "Only one name can be used to on the box" so maybe that isn't what you meant.

    I will look into the 24 hours thing on the PO box, the postal worker didnt mention 24 hour access so I assumed it wasnt, and she told me that mail should only be addressed to me when I asked that I wanted to have a few other people to have access to it and use a business name from time to time.

    Keep in mind that you get your mail delivered faster with a USPS PO Box. Ive had mine for over a year with no problems and  my mailman dosnt make me sign for anything.. You can actually add up to four or five different names on your box. Not that it matters. I get junk mail with all sorts of names on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, the UPS Box 24hr access sounds pretty awesome. It is also illegal for UPS to go through your mail that's been delivered by USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your really sketched out and paranoid you could always get both and switch it up. It really depends if you plan on ordering bulk or just personal amounts.

    I avoid walking into a PO as much as possible and suggest doing anything other than the PO box. Just too crazy walking into a PO to pick stuff up.

    If you have a PO box then plausible deniability is out the window.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A home address is public so anyone can send mail to it. A PO box very few people know unless you give it to them

    Well it is ganna be used as a legitimate business address that will posted publicly for clients to send the stuff they need to send etc so there is always that to consider.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am thinking however after more research I shouldnt mix business with pleasure, So Ill prob just keep it 100% for legit use.

    I've been having most of my associates use a service like the UPS store called Pakmail  24 hour service
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what we do is Send legitimate mail from the state the products coming from .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    we send legal letters to that box in the name of somebody the owner new as a child if it's a male  owns then we have him pick the name of a male friend from childhood
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then we subscribe to gay magazines and news letter and have those mail to that box and the owners passed friends name along with other gay like materials we also mail gay like materials like above In his name also legal name
    <br/>
    <br/>
    then we mailed the package with the product in the past friends name To the pakmail address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    we have been told by a manager of one of these locations
    <br/>
    If there is a controlled delivery at one of these locations that the police will do a controlled delivery his exact words
    <br/>
    <br/>
    he says they will put a slip in your box telling you to receive your package at the counter when you walk to the counter to receive your package they will try to get you to sign for it
    <br/>
    <br/>
    look at the package see that it is not in your name and refused to sign and walk out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the United States of America you cannot be arrested for what is mailed to you they have to prove In a court of law that you knew what was in the package And that you ordered it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even after signing for package you could still plausibly beat the case in court with a good lawyer.

    Legally speaking, plausible deniability still applies to a PO box since it is analogous to any other mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For ordering personal amounts, it really dosnt matter if your orders are mailed to a home address, UPS store, or PO box as long as your vendors  know how to ship properly and you take the necessary security precautions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, as long as you don't tell on yourself there isn't any proof that you ordered shit. This isn't Nazi Germany, the burden of proof is on them, not you.

    That makes sense but I guess the million dollar question is what is considered personal. I may have a weird view on quantity for personal verse distributions  but lets be honest "once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can." lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have the general feeling that anything under 100 grams or pills of most drugs IE Ketamine, MDMA, RC's etc  if found in customs would most likley just get tossed (or stolen) and a letter would be sent your way. Not sure about "harder" drugs though and oddly and as crazy as this sounds I feel like weed goes into the "harder" category IDK why but I just do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways I guess if I keep it low like a oz or so I'l be in the clear. *knocks on wood

    Technically, a personal amount is not enough weight for resale and distribution. You should check your state laws to see how much weight carries a trafficking charge. Basically, if your ounce of blow or kilo of ketamine gets seized at customs expect a visit from some federal Nazi law enforcement agency. If that happens "you need to rent a fast car with no top and you'll need to bring the cocaine" then get out of the country. Lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It really depends on what your ordering and your "needs" are. A personal amount for me are the occasional orders of a gram of  hash, molly, meth, or heroin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Roughly 70%  of my orders are pill orders, mostly roxies along with some benzos. I believe these to be the safest since they are stink free and very easy to conceal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I never order weed off silk road because I can just get that on the street since its pretty much legal in my state anyway. Not to mention it fucking reeks  sometimes and would probably stink up my tiny PO box for a week. I try to stay away from ordering stinky products.
