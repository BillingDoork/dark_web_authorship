    So i bought some mj on SR and it's now day 10 and I haven't seen a package in my my PO Box. I ordered seeds from the UK and they came in 6 days. The vendor has been pretty disheartening lately - taking a day or two to respond and when I asked to track the package he said "if you dont have package by saturday let me know. not going to digg through all these tracking numbers to find something unless it is truly late.".. It shouldn't be difficult to find my tracking number for gods sake. What should i do???

    I'm in the same boat. What I am going to do it wait a reasonable amount of time (14 days) and then go to resolution. It's all you can do if the parcel doesn't show, unless the vendor cancels.
