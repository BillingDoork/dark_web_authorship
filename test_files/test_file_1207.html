    I suppose this could go into the shipping forum as well. anyways...

    There are these services set up (usually for having mail sent to an address in a reputable country and then sent to a distant country) Many companies do this and xpats.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyone had any experience with these services in any context?

    doesn't sound very good mate, the package will still have to get through country 1's customs, and then country 2's. so not only does it have twice the chance of getting pulled up, it also has enough to time start stinking if the packaging isn't very good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if the packaging is done properly it will get anywhere

    A fair point. But I was more thinking domestic or possibly near domestic. since the package can be signed for at the forwarding it can also be sent express. it would also be repacked (a bigger envelope/box) so another layer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do get your point even best case it turns a 2-3 day shipping (domestic/near domestic) to 5-6days. for many substances this, it wouldn't be a problem. For the smelly products.. it might be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    plus it still has to make it to you by mail.. I suppose this is really only of use to vendors if there are a large number of undeliverable packs, or for near domestic (US to Canada).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for the avg buyer the safety doesn't change much I guess.
