    I've been ordering from overseas for many years. As of the past few months more and more packages are being seized/sent back to sender. I always use different addresses and names, so I know it's not something to do with my address. Anyone experiencing similar problems?

    That's a shame.  UK to US is usually no problem at all.

    I think it depends on a number of things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.Stealth- the best way to send to the us i believe is small amounts in a letter. double vac sealed in a double think folded paper. mbb is nice but now customs have a trick. they can punch a whole on the bottom of the letter and peak in. if they see the silve or black color they know its not a letter and maybe can do a closer insppection. but witha folded double card when they do that all they see is a white paper. but vac seals only last a couple days so canada to us will be ok but uk to us might not be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. if its coming from netherlands or drug producing countryi believe a bigger package is safer cause you have more room for stealth.
    <br/>
    but a letter might get a hole puncher right throw it which could mean trouble. with that said I got a buisnss letter from sukey from germany to us in 5 days. no tampering and the stealth was good but no mbb
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. 17 days is alot but i think its becasue uk has and advance system also for out going male so it would be harder to get out of the countrt. if you FE adn you are new becareful cause a small amount of  vendors will not send it take your money even if they have a great track record.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4 always FE always. its not worth it be patien!! youll find the right vendor that will welcome u with open arms.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5.dont use new vendors. wait till he has at least 20 or 30 sucessful transactions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    6.if its to good to be true it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    7. dont label anyone a scammer if your new and keep ur refund rate low some times ts better to take a lost and keep your stats good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    8. remeber were buying drugs so the money  you spend can be lost at anytime even on the streets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    9. 17 days is alot but it can take up to 30 days so be patient and dont stress.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    search search search the forums  there is alot of help here good luck!

    I won't say how but I don't import GHB raw materials outside of the US anymore.  But I have unlimited supply. I will soon setup a vendor account and sell G as well as steroids, xanax, etc.  Most of my packages that I receive are steroids, HGH, and other pharamaceuticals that aren't typically schedule 1. Sometimes a mix of both, most of where I order from are Asian countries.

    I only make sodium GHB because that's what everyone seems to want. I think I'll start with highly concentrated liquid, then move to powder after I build reputation/show that I can make a profit and figure out the process of cashing out BTC etc.

    they have autmated systems for smaller orders that why i mean they can scan many letters in one minut therought there machines. checking the boxes of a bigger package from uk to us is time consuming and sometimes you have to provide additonal info whcih could deter some buyers. for instance i ordered a vaporiser from california to be shipped to italy froma company. the magic flight launch box vaporizer. they shipped using usps express packge under a 1 lb. when i checked out they ask for my phone number, i gave it casue its not illegal to buy here. i got a call  days later for italian customs and they needed me to fill out a form to declare what was in the package and provide a recipet only because the  company did not specify what was specifcally in the box( icouldnt say personal item or gift) the valueand a provide a reciept in the box, s. i filled it out sent them a reciept via email and they release the package. it was never opened and no signs of peaking. it got me thinking that vendors should (which some already do) declare what it is. that way it should go through no problem, sconly which would be even more cool is provide a fake recipet with a novelty item like jolly rancher candy lunch box and actually put the reciept on the package. this will cause less of a flag to go up. alsoa throw away phone number to from the seller. so if you have to sign anything you will have prrof with the reciep that u were buying candy and they  you had no idea about anything else in side the package. rember they cannot get a tap on your phone if they dont have evidence to present to the judge that you knowingly and willful shipped drugs. and with no drugs in your hands you are fine. dont say shit. dont even deny. one word needs to be said lawyer. then let your mouth dry up and let the talk for 5 mins then say iam i under arrest. they say no. then u say can i go? peace

    So, I should stop smoking joints while I pack up packages?

    Tossing lit joints into mailboxes around town should fuck with drug dogs quite nicely.   -:)
