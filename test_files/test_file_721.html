    few packages i got have eaither shown the tracking as deliverd but has not been&lt; then shows up a day or to later&gt;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    aND NOW i had APACKage sent priority friday and i got it saturday from west to east coast&lt; which was amazing i have never had a priority pack come in less than 24hrs from coast to coast.. But i just happen to look at the dcn # on usps out of curiousness and its showingits still going and being scanned through sort facilitys and all, like its still on the way to me. But i already got it.
    <br/>
    It must have something to do with the new tracking.. cause i have NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like i got something sent from AUS, International express. I tracked it, and Monday i saw my mail lady and 3 hrs later i check the usps site and it said 'Slip left no recipient was home to sign' WTF? So i called and it said clear as day it was in my P O. SO i called up there the next morning (THIS WAS NOT DRUGS BTW JUST CASH) And the  PO SAID no they did not have it and i know my postal women very well, i use to be involved with lets say someone close to her.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the PO says the truck is here,maybe its on it, so i had to SLOWLY EXPLAIN LIKE TO A CHILD my tracking showed my fucking package was there, ,she of course said call back.. So i call back 3 hrs later, and she says nope no Package for,u..So then sas maybe its coming ups or fed ex sir? I HAD TO TELL HER AGAIN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL!!!  SO she says wait then hold on, then comes back and repeats my address and says yeah we have it just came in today ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    WTF?? IT CLEARLY SHOWED IT HAD TRIED TO BE DELIVERD WHICH I KNEW WAS WRONG AND THEN SAID IT WAS AT MY PO...THE LADY SAID since it was express after it clears customs they have only 2 days to get it to u and they messed up and marked it anyway so they wuldnt have to regund the money..and also the tracking is messing up...

    I'm having a similar problem with a package that was marked delivered today yet I met the postmen at the door and he had nothing.  I'm hoping it comes in a day or two.

    Yea thats the same here with me money package..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then Get this i have a priority reship from west coast Friday   I get it Saturday on the eastcoast.. I mean it came like it was express!! Weird.. Then When i got it SAT i looked at the tracking and it said it was still on west coast area. Then Monday i checked just seeing, and they were treating it as though it was going through facilitys and being scanned and then sorted and shipped..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Very weird. My P O said its the change over, When i called the 800 # to ask they claimed it would not effect it at all, but of course there not gonna say yeah its all fucked up we dont know how to ffix it..lol..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I should be getting a tracking in a day or so we will see how that goes. I just wanted to know if other had similar issues

    I have noticed alot of new scans, double scans and missed scans since the new year began.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Part of the reason I changed to no tracking on alot of orders, its not worth the expense, security risk or quickness anymore. You get more headaches looking at tracking than you do answers lol.

    I had same shit. 3 times it said delivered and was no where to be found. At first i thought maybe got sent to nieghbor? but 3 times said delivered and 2 domestic one was dcn and 2 tracking one intern all 3 said delivered and was in my mailbox the next day, and since then i have had tracking all fuckedup
    <br/>
    Any one have their shit sit in customs for 4 or 5 days after it says inbound out of customs? I mean it never even said inbound in?  I mean i saw that and thought i was in the clear it would be here today! and not shit! So any feedback would be great!
