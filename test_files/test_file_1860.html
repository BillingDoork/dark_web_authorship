    I mainly deal in benzos, but always running low on stock, and i like to get psychedelics in time to time. Only do Aus to Aus delivery. And i got some good customer service rep.

    <br/>
    Also you got EnterTheMatrix, http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/351ee799c9 very good aswell.

    Dundee, you really have a great variety of Aussie vendors and products these days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We first started vending 11 months ago and the amount of sellers in Australia you could count on one hand!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Things have changed and SR has grown exponentially - good luck with your travels on the road...

    I'll add MetaSphere as a suggestion, mainly for Psyches and MXE so far. They're fairly new so they could use a plug. I haven't had first hand experience yet, but this should change soon :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I'll second EnterTheMatrix as well. They've come through for me more than once, and I'm sure they will continue to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Above all else, be careful and do your research before you buy. Anyone can tell you anything in the forums, but established feedback speaks for itself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPDATE: I've had an order come through from MetaSphere now. Can vouch for their professionalism and communication but will post details about the product in their review forum.

    Hey thanks for the mention Spunkaroo, appreciate it mate!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah we are pretty new around here. We're looking to become a trusted part of the SR community. So far all feedback has been very positive. 8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We stock things that we like to experiment with ourselves. At the moment, like Spunkaroo said, we have mostly psychedelic RCs plus some shrooms and MXE. Our product range will fluctuate a bit. We intend for 2CE, 2CI and 25i to be mainstays. Other things will come and go depending on availability.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Drop on by peoples. New SR members WELCOME!

    First thing I thought too was LE, I guess because of all the media attention lately. They'd probably be more technologically inclined, then again, it's possible they'd take the newbie route. Who knows, anyway, it's not worth speculating because we all know they're here. Just be careful with what you say or insinuate, don't admit to anything and don't talk.

    I recommend methaqualone(98) for all your psychedelic needs. Also has xanax at a slighty higher price then some others (since he self caps). He's slightly less professional than some other senders (read: very laid back IMHO) but always comes through with the good.

     I recommend methaqualone(98) for all your psychedelic needs. Also has xanax at a slighty higher price then some others (since he self caps). He's slightly less professional than some other senders (read: very laid back IMHO) but always comes through with the good.

    We will have to try him (Methaqualone) to get some 2C-E,  heard that stuff is pretty awesome. Have you tried it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We have been loving the 2C family lately and just got some absolutely killer 2C-B in stock which would have to be our strongest yet, it's fucking intense! Even better if you combine it with some MDMA.

    Ah yeah i had your 2C-B with molly and it was pretty insane. If i was in a different atmosphere then it would have been crazy. Was very clean, and had zero comedown.

    I've tried Methaqualone's Moxy, but not the 2C-E... ;)
