    Hi, im a noob here and i ordered a package wednesday morning and it is still in the "processing" status.(its currently thursday night). Both of us(vendor and i) are in the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this something to be concerned about?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've read other threads where the status will be "in transit" fairly quickly after the purchase. Maybe I'm just a tad paranoid. But i thought i'd ask the more experienced...

    Check the vendors page. He/she usually has info on what days he ships out!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some vendors only ship on certain days, some vendors are backlogged. No worries my friend! You have little to worry about :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully you didn't need that package asap! Welcome to the road btw ;D

    Hi demonata,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's not at all unusual, and nothing to be concerned about. Silk Road allows vendors 4 days to process orders; if they are not shipped within this time-frame you will be given the option to cancel the order and have your Bitcoin refunded to you minus the 4% hedging fee if the vendor hedges their orders.

    Hi Demonata,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I remember my first purchase like it was yesterday .. wait, it was only 40 yesterdays ago ... anyway, I remember thinking that if I got scammed - Oh Well, at least I tried this thing out and one day, many many many moons from now I could tell my grandchildren about how we had to do everything under cover of darknet back in the day and how risky it was.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I posted a thread just like you:  it's still in processing ..how long should it take, .. am I screwed out of $100 .. The order did arrive after about 9 business days and I just stared at it unable to believe that I just got some weed in the mail - THE FUCKING MAIL!! Oh how young and smug I felt back then all that time ago ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But that was 40 days and 3 orders ago.. now I'm a crusty old man and I'm out of weed and waiting on an order and its Friday night and I'm dry ... DAMN YOU SILK ROAD!! GOD DAMN YOU YOU TEASING MISTRESS!!!

    Yeah one day is not strange at all if it is still in processing. You still have your money in escrow so as long as you don't FE you will keep your money even if you get scammed (I think that's the way it is, anyone else chime in). My order is going on 4 days of processing, and I'm sure my seller won't ship until Monday at the earliest, so I am expecting at least 3 more days in processing, I'm guessing it will be 5 days, but that's just me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck &amp; good vibes nevertheless!

    Just so everybody knows including you i'll explain how it works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP there's a few different ways each order can pan out everytime you make a purchase on SR. This is great for buyers to know as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you place an order, a vendor has 4 days in which your order is in processing.
    <br/>
    After 4 days if the vendor doesn't put your order in transit or cancel it within 4 days, your order auto cancels itself and your BTC returns back to you instantly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assuming he puts it in transit you should check his vendor page for how long shipping normally takes whether it's domestic or international
    <br/>
    This also of course depends on what shipping you purchase
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Normal courtesy for me is wait 2 days around when the shipping times are in sync with when the vendor put the order in transit
    <br/>
    IE: If you have priority shipping 2-3 day domestic, wait

    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP there's a few different ways each order can pan out everytime you make a purchase on SR. This is great for buyers to know as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you place an order, the money you used to purchase said item goes into what we call escrow.
    <br/>
    Escrow is essentially the 2nd to last step before the vendor can receive their money,
    <br/>
    And is in place for your protection in the off chance your parcel doesn't arrive, a mutual resolution will be in place.. that will be discussed further down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    .. continuing on --
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A vendor has 4 days in which your order can be held in processing.
    <br/>
    If said vendor doesn't put your order in transit or cancel it within 4 days, your order auto cancels itself and your BTC returns back to you instantly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assuming he/she puts your order in transit you should, assuming you did research on the vendor, know how long shipping will take whether it's domestic or international.
    <br/>
    This also of course depends on what shipping you purchase.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Normally what I do is wait 2-3 days after I was due to receive the package, while being in sync with when the vendor put your order in transit (**don't get this part twisted, start counting the shipping days AFTER the order gets put in transit**) before I message a vendor regarding ETA.
    <br/>
    IE: If your order is priority shipping 2-3 day domestic, wait 5 days AFTER the order gets put in transit before messaging a vendor asking where your order may be.
    <br/>
    This really helps vendors out if you follow a guideline similar to this. Vendors get a decent amount of messages asking where my order is from noobs within a few days of ordering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the event your package never comes, you will then instead of finalizing (assuming you didn't FE), will want to click the resolution button after XX amount of days.
    <br/>
    The SR admins will then step in and from there they will ask the vendor for the DCN for your said parcel.
    <br/>
    The vendor must then provide the delivery confirmation to an admin confirming that your package did or didn't arrive.
    <br/>
    Depending on said circumstances, if the vendor can't provide the delivery confirmation the buyer will automatically win and get either a 50/50 or full refund, usually.
    <br/>
    If the vendor DOES provide the delivery confirmation, well then you're most likely out of luck. Vendors copy your address EXACTLY how you write it (very rarely is it an address mistake).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that cleared up any questions for you guys. I hope everybody follows that guideline! It really will put less of a strain on vendors like us :)
