    Hey y'all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a friend in S.America... One of the "high-risk" countries... They have AMAZING insurance benefits there. While he could give Pepsi his run for their money... We don't mean that when I say we want to go Old School 80s. With the nature of his location and my destination being in the States (we want to cut down on shipping cost/time... plus I always filter "Domestic Only"), we are leery of shipping. Is it possible to set up a P.O. Box in a non-"high-risk" country and have the package forwarded from this seemingly 'innocent' country?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice would be lovely!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace&amp;Love,
    <br/>

    Are you talking about having him send stuff to a country that's different from the one where you are, and it would then be forwarded on to your country? I would assume that pretty much any country that itself is low risk of being red-flagged is also going to red-flag the country where your friend is. In other words, I don't know that the odds of a shipment being seized are much less by sending them to country X instead of the U.S. Plus, if you go this route, you have to worry about customs twice, once when your friend sends a shipment to the intermediary country, and then again when it gets sent from there on to you.
