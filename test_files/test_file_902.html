    So I ordered a few things about three days ago, I'm wondering if it was a bad idea to have multiple orders knowing that they'll probably arrive on the same day. Both orders were shipped the same day and are domestic so I expect they would get here at the same time. I guess the only real reason I'm worried is because there was no mail today at all. It might be too soon to be worried though i suppose, anyone have any experience with this?

    I would think that two deliveries should not be a big deal if its small quantities, and you used your value name &amp; address.
    <br/>
    When I expect a delivery,  I make sure to be gone when mail arrives,  and return home 2-3 hours later.
    <br/>
    If you see a new mailman who waited 3 hours to get your signature for the deliveries,  you might want refuse delivery, shut up and call your lawyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Odds are great  there is nothing to worry about.
    <br/>
    Just be sure to use your real name,  as USPS can detect and flag names not associated with your address.

    Try not to have too many overseas orders arrive the same day. Might look a little suspicious if your addresss usually dont receive packages, but all of a sudden one day gets 3 packages from Amsterdam.

    I asked the same question before, and came to the conclusion that it's all relative. If you get a significant amount of mail usually, or enough that a few packages could blend in with daily mail, then I don't think you have a problem. If your mailman knows you don't get much stuff in the mail delivered, and all of a sudden have several parcels arriving at your address, then there might be some suspicion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many of the times I order I either have some other product coming as well like something I buy from Amazon, so that the rest of the packages blend in well and look legitimate. They usually coincide with delivery times, and I've had 4 packages come on the same day and everything was fine.

    ditto.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are a lot of factors that come into play with the postal system. While it is good practice only to have one order in transit at a time it usually isn't a big deal if you have one or two items in transit. I try to keep a tight ship myself when ordering. Takes longer but its eases my paranoia quite a bit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would echo a lot of what is already said. I would have your postal carrier trained to expect you to have frequent packages coming in from all over. ebay,amazon etc etc... and who knows maybe pick up letter writing and have pen pals from the EU. That way its not out of the question for you to receive mail from overseas. ;) just be smart, keep your orders small and keep up to speed with your vendors and do your due diligence and it works out 99.9% of the time.

    If they are all domestic I wouldn't think twice about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The best approach is to have a high volume of legitimate packages - even if a lot is UPS/FedEx.  Consider subscribing for grocery items at Amazon.  They will sometimes ship USPS as well which is ideal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to be really strategic, then order some sort of grocery item from another vendor every week that always ships USPS.  Or buy on eBay.  My guess is the vast majority of eBay sellers use USPS rather than private couriers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember the fundamental idea is for SR packages to simply blend in with all the other packages in the system - and at your address.

    I receive multiple packages from the vendors all at once and I've never had a problem...to the mail man they are regular packages just like every other package they deliver.
