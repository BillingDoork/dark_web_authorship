    Just so I don;t get bashed, I DID use the search function first and didn't get an answer to my specific question. So I have my first international order on the way. It's a schedule 4 substance, so I'm not too worried, but I would still like some reassurance. I'm going to guess that even if the stealth isn't SUPER great, that a drug that's in such a low priority class will have very little trouble getting through. I would think the fact that we have a pretty friendly relationship with Canada would mean that there are LOTS of packages crossing the Canadian border heading south, and that I could be fine. Thoughts? Comments?  EASE MY TENSION DAMMIT!!

    Custom's doesn't decide what they do and don't seize based on the amount they find or what schedule it is.  If they find it then they are going to seize it.  As for personal amounts, realize that your idea of a personal amount and the legal definition of a personal amount are very different.

    My experience is that you're better off getting a package from Europe if it goes through east coast customs than you are getting a package from Canada if it goes through west coast customs.  West coast customs is much tougher.  Regardless, the majority of packages from Canada will still make it through.

    As always, make sure the drop is clean.

    Well, its a pretty small personal use quantity, and I'm not sure it will be going through east coast customs, so I guess that's in my favor. Thanks guys. +1
