    Hi guys, let me start out by saying that in my mind there's nothing wrong with being a little paranoid at all times.
    <br/>
    My question pertains to receiving packages and building a legal case for later in time. Is it likely that during an investigation LE would allow one to continue to receive packages that they know contain illicit content, well before staging a controlled delivery?
    <br/>
    I'm just curious if LE may have something on some of us, opening our packages then sending them out and documenting each one to build a strong case before a controlled delivery. Theoretically LE could then say that one continued to receive drugs from several sources without returning the package, strengthening a legal case in event of a refusal of controlled delivery or otherwise.

    This actually is a good point.  And to top it off, I could see them letting some slide in preparation to catch you with something bigger.  Once they see things stabilize, then going after you.

    From what I've read that's normally how it goes down. If they seize your package most likely you'll find out because they don't just open packages randomly and think "oh maybe there's drugs in this one." It's very tedious for LE to open packages and even more tedious to know which ones to open. Again from what I've read (should never be taken as fact) LE wait until you receive large orders and then go after you but I wouldn't be too concerned about ordering personal amounts.

    I'm pretty sure its against LE's policy to let any drugs get through just to see where they go, they arent allowed to let any drugs re-enter the marketplace at all, this is a good way of finding out if someone your dealing with is an undercover, simply ask them to sell you a small amount of weed and if they are dodgy about it then just fuck them off.

    I think your thinking of informants...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Undercover officers couldn't go around selling drugs that would be directly contributing to everything they are trying to stop. They would be supplying a drug user. They can sell drugs but they must bust the person they sell it to very shortly after as far as i know.

    I'm just repeating what i heard from a drug enforcement officer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you guys understand there are laws in place to protect us and our privacy. The police have to apply to a court to get a surveillance warrant and if they came to them with a case of "this package was on its way to a PO box, the name on it doesn't match the person who owns the PO box but can we start studying this guys every move anyway?" They would most likely not get approval for surveillance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not saying you guys are wrong i'm just discussing what i understand about the law, the cops aren't above it.

    From their point of view, I would be worried that if I let a shipment through that there may not be another one either at all, or within our investigation window.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, if they are pretty sure that there will be more as they have been monitoring you for a while and know your pattern then you are fucked no matter what.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, unless you are a bigger fish I don't think they'd let them through.
