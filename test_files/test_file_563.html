    Hey Fellas,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First I am happy to report I busted my SR cherry last week, an got a nice easy delivery. Of course it took me about a month to figure out Tor, bitcoins, private keys, then decide is it better to use real name, fake name, then find a vendor I felt I could trust. After all that it took me another 2 weeks to get the balls to finally pull the trigger. Now I finally completed my first transaction I look forward to making more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me preface this by saying I spent many hours sifting through many threads looking for a consensus, or at least one answer, but I couldnt find one. I am looking for a full proof way of not getting busted. So my question is, if I order a package from SR and they do a controlled delivery and knock on my door, what would happen if I refuse to take possession of the package? Meaning the LE says, "please sign", I say "no, I dont want the package", and close the door, can they arrest me? If so what would be the charge for a personal use amount, "conspiracy to possess" ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The venders are not sending me parcels I have to sign, so if Mr. Postman comes up to the door with a package I know the jig is up and I refuse it, shouldnt I be 100% safe, if not what am I missing. Thanks.

    Chances are that if they've gone as far as a controlled delivery they are going to raid you regardless of accepting the package so it all comes down to what else you have in the house I guess... Good news is that as long as it's for large quantities it is very unlikely that things will get this far.

    My guess is they would take you in and question you. It's at this time you have to be strong and not say anything without a lawyer. Just stay calm and make sure there is nothing in your house at the time of delivery.

    1. They will not bust people for 2 grams of weed every now and then.
    <br/>
    2. Controlled delivery means resources, time and effort from LE's side. I highly doubt you're worth their time, resources or effort.
    <br/>
    3. Don't talk, If the postman asks for signature tell him you're not expecting anything and close the door politely.
    <br/>
    4. In the unfortunate event of them having a warrant, considering that you refused to sign they will most likely search your house.
    <br/>
    5. Even if they find your 2 grams, you have to shut the fuck up. You have the right to remain silent.
    <br/>
    6. Keep saying lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer like a retard to annoy the shit out of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S. If you shut up and don't sign your chances of getting in trouble are lowering more than you can imagine.

    Plausible deniability - No way to prove you knew what you were signing for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EVERYBODY who isn't on SR, automatically signs. Sending them away "Oh I'm not expecting anything. Ahhh!!!" and running away like a scared little girl, will send up more red flags than Chinese invasion! :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's only happened twice with SR. They were both in my "newbie phase", and as I was signing, I did have shivers up+down my spine. 1 time they were using "signature confirmation" instead of "delivery confirmation" or "DCN" as they call it on here. The 2nd time it was some 3rd rate version of FedEx, TNT?? I think? It was Valium from India IOW fake Valium lol.  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my two cents. - You're being a hell of a lot smarter than I ever was, by being here, asking these questions now. So you're off to a fine start!  Good Luck!  8)

    In my own mind I thought signing would be fine too, then giving the "anybody can send the queen of england drugs defense". But after reading here and doing some googling it seems possessing the package= possession, at least until a jury decides.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my thought than switched to, even if they know that I know there are drugs in the package they still have to have me possess the package for any arrest to take place. Even if I say to him, "I never accept a package I have to sign for" and give him a wink, I still am not taking possession of the  package. What is the beenfit of signing for a package that you know does not require a signature. The red flags should not make a difference at the point that they are making a CD. So they then know I know they are onto me, what else can they do other than search my home if thye have a warrant?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I read so many posts here about, "to sign or not to sign", "real name or fake name", etc,,,I think it is all moot if you simply refuse the package (ofc you lose the money, but that is lost anyway once they ask for s as signature from a seller who you know does not require one). I am just looking for holes to see if this method is bullet-proof against prosecution. Again consider no goods in my home time of delivery.

    Check "return to sender" and then put your box in the trash for a week.

    Just remember not to throw your rubbish out. :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But writing return to sender on it and then throwing it in the trash is silly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like who does that? It would be sitting on a kitchen bench, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And secondly, seeing as this has been mentioned in the forums....writing 'return to sender' on it will be something they'll expect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yes plausible dependability is your always your friend.

    You're being overly cautious. If they want to sting you, they wont do it by signature. Unless someone can provide a link to a story on how someone was convicted by merely signing for a package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How many times, before SR existed, did you just sign and let the poor working slob be on his way??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll tell you what, if you get one that requires signing. Get on of us, assuming we like the same drugs, and we'll come over and sign for it. Let them blame us! - By the way you're splitting it 60/40 - me being
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the 60 side of things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothings gonna happen. Just sign the fucking thing. If the federals really want to get us all, they'll just hire a better programmer/hacker than the one who runs SR. By the way, these forums are less secure than the SR site itself. - I'm no IT guy, but I took a look into the guts of this, and they can track you and everything. Try the "Help" feature, and look up privacy issues. We're all being tracked and recorded on here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DPR doesn't run the forums. He does a kick-ass job running SR, but this is not his entity. It's a whole other company.
    <br/>

    Though I thought a story would've shown up on the forums, no I haven't GOOGLED it. I will use a search engine other than the Obama supporting, big brother tracking us Google twinks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the advice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the US, you have to sign to receive a package sometimes. You can't "see what's in it" first. So plausible deniability is still in our favor, at least in the US. Seems like Austrailia has some weird laws as far as busting people. I have seen those videos on Youtube.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Our personal liberties are being eroded here in the US by the Obama administration,  so it wouldn't surprise me if "plausible deniability" goes the way of "Habeas Corpus"
    <br/>
    While everyone was partying on New Years Eve 2011, Obama was busy signing away your right to unlawful imprisonment. For those of you who watch regular TV, I thought that might be news.
    <br/>
    This ensures that a prisoner can be released from unlawful detention—that is, detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence. The remedy can be sought by the prisoner or by another person coming to the prisoner's aid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I don't blame you all for being too careful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Meanwhile, I'll try to find a case where the whole thing hinged upon the fact that the person signed for the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you've got one, please post the link. I really have other shit to do.
