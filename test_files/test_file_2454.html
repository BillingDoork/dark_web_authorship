    Looking for advice as to my next action.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Package was shipped and 'delivered' in 3 days according to the DCN. No package or notice was left. The stated day of delivery was Sat. On Tue., I received a called on one of my numbers from a private number claiming to be the post office. Before anything more was said, the call disconnected (probably due to my internet).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've used this seller before and the same sort of package was delivered (also within 3 days) and left in the box like normal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, should I cut my losses or try visiting the post office? I can take a misdemeanor or two but definitely do not want a felony charge.  I'm unclear on how they assess the 'crossing state lines' complication.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh, it's an eighth of doja.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance.

    not sure about your situation exactly
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but recently i had an express order that i was waiting on all day friday and saturday for the mailman to come to my door
    <br/>
    <br/>
    then i check tracking and it says already attempted delivery... i was like wtf - i sat there all day watching and know it wasnt attempted
    <br/>
    <br/>
    evidently didnt even try to deliver the package just took it back to the PO for me to pick up, which i had to wait for the weekend to pass until the PO was open which was frustrating. picked it up monday with no issues

    How did they get your number?  It shows delivered last saturday?   I'd cut your losses.  Don't risk it.

    I guess they could have looked it up in the phonebook (if the name was correct and your #'s listed), but it still seems shady. If they made a mistake, why wouldn't they just re-deliver instead? I, too, would be afraid to risk it.

    Indeed, this was a standard, listed phone number. I also cannot fathom a reason for them to not send it except general USPS laziness/ineptness (not very likely in this case).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would love to hear their reasoning for not sending the package, I suspect it would be mildly amusing.

    Thanks for the replies.

    When I was a kid, I had some friends who would drive around stealing packages left in mailboxes/on doorsteps.  The phone call sounds pretty strange though.

    It is possible it was swiped. That would be the first instance I am aware of on this street, though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What about this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I call the post office and ask them if they did actually call. If they say yes, I will ask them what they wanted. They will then probably mention a package and I can state that I am not expecting any packages and/or ask for the return address. Then, I will simply request a return to sender.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking the above may allow for the package to be recovered by the seller and should pose minimal (if any) risk to either party. The only other 'safe' route would be leaving the package in their hands indefinitely. If they haven't inspected it yet, they probably would.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going to contact the seller and make sure he agrees before I take further action.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any obvious holes in my logic?
