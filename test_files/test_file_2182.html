    I've have a package sitting in AUS customs for over a week now. Surely it doesn't take that long to clear? or does it?

    A week is a possibility, but if it's not released in the next couple of days, I'd say it's been seized. Does your tracking state that it's in customs or is it being processed?

    if it says something like 'received and awaiting clearance for delivery' it's through customs, they're just arranging delivery which can take WEEKS - they leave it saying 'awaiting clearance' to make any delays look like its customs fault. it's the processing bit before that on the tracking info - that's when it's in customs.

    you didn't track it through TOR did you? if you did they're probably waiting for a warrant to open it

    You sure that using TOR to check tracking progress is a 100% seize?

    not 100%, but you really don't want to find that out the hard way do you?

    how do you know that if the status is "received and awaiting clearance for delivery" its passed customs? i thought it meant it was into customs? like even when you call up the phone to track they say its in customs?

    i sent something legal to a friend of mine and it was taking the piss on the timescale front, and found this process on the auspost site
    <br/>
    <br/>
    •Accepted by Australia Post (Item is lodged)
    <br/>
    •Received and ready for processing
    <br/>
    •Processed - en-route to final destination
    <br/>
    •Received and awaiting clearance for delivery
    <br/>
    •Transferred for delivery processing
    <br/>
    •Scheduled for delivery
    <br/>
    •Delivered
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and after an immense amount of googling i found that 'processed - en-route to final destination' is the stage where it's through customs. as you can see the next step is 'received and awaiting clearance'. it did take me ages to find that info though

    don't give up hope just yet mate, as i said it can take them ages to pull their finger out.  - i'm pretty sure the first 'processed' part is customs, unless they have customs at sorting offices?
