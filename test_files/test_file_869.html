    I was looking at some vendors from OS and most of them only offer %50 refund if pack is lost(and only if proved with tracking number, otherwise its 0%).. Does this include staying in escrow or is this 50% rule only if you FE ? Doesnt staying in escrow guarentee full refund if pack is lost, no matter what the seller says his policy is..?

    it is because a customs seizure is nobodys fault. The seller is not at fault nor is the buyer. Its just bad luck!! So 50% is the only percentage that is fair.
    <br/>
    This includes both FE's and escrows.Although some vendors don't provide refunds when you FE. So never FE!!
    <br/>
    Escrow does not guarantee you as a buyer to full refund. You can only fight the case in the resolution center for your money.

    I'm not a vendor, but I imagine it's to share the burden of risk. If a package goes missing and you get a 100% refund, the vendor has lost their product and you've lost nothing. If you got a 0% refund, you've lost your money and the vendor has lost nothing. 50% split means both parties lose a little from the risk of doing what you're doing. Many times this is outside the control of the vendor.

    Speaking as someone who operates on essentially this policy:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1-I get proof of postage on international orders, so people know I've shipped (I'll produce proof of postage if an item doesn't show) and hence the primary risk is customs.
    <br/>
    So, I offer a reship if customs takes the package (although reships must be to a different address) or a 50% refund, since a customs seizure leaves me arguably partially responsible (since my stealth has failed) and therefore I owe it to the customer to offer them some kind of compromise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2-In the event that they claim something hasn't showed and there's no customs letter, I only really have their word for it, so for people who aren't repeat customers and don't have good account feedback my refunds are fairly minimal.

    With established vendors 150+ you be sweet, but be very weary of new vendors with this
    <br/>
    kind of policy as SOME of them will just not send anything(especially to some counties)
    <br/>
    and just get 50% for free.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do your research and before making a purchase.

    Having a package tracked does not mean it was shipped to the person that ordered it. Tracking does not contain details of delivery address or recipient. It can be used as a scam.

    I'm more surprised when a reputable vendor offers a 100% reship.
    <br/>
    Package gets seized, lost or stolen on the way. It's not your fault. It's not the vendor's either. It's one of the risk of the trade we're all supposed to know about, so a 50/50 share on that risk seems fair to me.

    A package not making it to the destination isn't necessarily (and isn't usually) because it got seized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it does get seized then I have to at least suspect the vendor may have fucked up their packaging.  There is no excuse for contaminating the outside of the outside of the drug package with drugs.  Frankly, MBBs should always be used for certain drugs as well (coke, mdma, etc).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just my opinion.  Ask the vendor in advance.  If you don't like their policy then don't buy.

    Packages will sometimes be checked randomly.
    <br/>
    If your package is inspected with x-ray or backscatter tech, chances are high with most drugs that they will find them.
    <br/>
    It's not always a vendors fault.  A customer should be aware of the laws in their country, and should have some idea how customs will treat their packages when ordering.
    <br/>
    If that particular vendor is having issues getting packages out regularly, I would say their stealth is not so good and they should offer more than 50% back, but most vendors are doing pretty good I think.

    All international mail is randomly opened and thoroughly manually inspected, it has nothing to do with drug residues on the outside. It's the random inspections that lead to seizures of SR orders.

    I had a vendor offer 50% minus shipping fees even though I paid for shipping. Then they get butt hurt when we got to resolution after they said to go there if I didn't like that offer. Ended up with 50%. POS vendor IMO.

    If there really was a seizure then talk with the vendor privately.  Scammers love to claim seizures but if you can show the vendor evidence of the seizure and they believe you then there's a good chance you'll get a better refund.
