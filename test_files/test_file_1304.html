    As a vendor, I label all my products (all I vend is weed). However, as I buyer of other goodies on SR, I've noticed very few, if any, label their orders. This isn't a problem when ordering one thing at a time, but when one places multiple orders from different vendors and they start to show up at the same time, you can guess what happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else having this problem?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe I'm missing something, is it a security reason?

    The answer for me is: It depends.  If it's weed, yes, please label it with the strain.  It's not as if the label is going to help LE!  If it's a white, off white or brown powder, then it's more complicated.  Cocaine need not be labeled, because it's obvious from the smell that it's coke.  But RCs and psychedelics should always be labeled clearly and accurately, IMO.  The likelihood of a mistake that could lead to serious injury or death (or at least a very bad night) is far too great to be sending these compounds unlabeled.  God forbid someone thinks the 25i is 2C-B and snorts 10 mg!  MDMA need not be labeled. It's usually obvious that it's MDMA and there's almost no way to OD on MDMA by mistake unless you're a total fool.  I don't have any experience with heroin, so I will withhold judgment on that one.  Since some one could die from a mistake, I suspect it's best to label it, but I seriously doubt any H vendors do.  Pharmaceutical pills have ID numbers, which speak for themselves, so no need to label.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, in summary:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Psychedelics: yes, always.
    <br/>
    RCs: yes, always.
    <br/>
    Weed: yes, strain please
    <br/>
    Coke: no
    <br/>
    MDMA/MDA: no
    <br/>
    Heroin: Leaning towards yes.
    <br/>
    Pharms: No need.
    <br/>
    Powdered benzos: yes, always.
    <br/>

    Listen to this guy, what he say is really smart  ;D Legal RC must be labelled correctly because they will arrive at destination that way if they are checked up, i mean if LE found a white unknown powder in a bag they will not let it go.. if this comes with the material safety data sheet and all other correct label from a chemical supplier this will pass customs like if it's your old grandma!

    Thats a good point and the exact reason I have held off an order. I have 2 very different things I have not yet tried, which look very similar coming from the same country. If I mistake them, I will not od, but will have a very bad trip.
    <br/>
    On the other hand, you dont want to have your shit stamped "Really good MDMA" or "Awesome H from *Vendor Name", so I suppose get in touch with the vendor beforehand and get them to mark it with something  you will recognise upon arrival and wont make it easy for LE if they do intercept.

    of course, putting a description or names on the (inner) package wouldn't be wise, but a simple sign or so shouldn't be  aproblem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    About the contacting beforehand: Some vendors have supply-chains and won't be able to individually label their bags/whatever on request, so I think this is something a vendor should do automatically, e.g. informing whoever actually makes the packages to put the sign on every package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OR, just came into my mind, the vendor could also inform the customer about the return address he used (and I think it is commonly agreed that a return address is part of a professional package).

    I always keep a small set of labels on hand so I can label each item/bag as it's packed (type/amount) butbefore it goes in to the sealer and get's packaged for sending. Internally, everything is labelled, though you would have no clue looking at it from outside the package.

    as a vendor of only mushrooms i feel they do not need to be labeled no matter the form and that labeling is a form of counter surveillance once it leaves the seller. but i agree with the like 2nd poster i think with that big list. never heard of someone eating enough mushrooms to do any lasting damage even to the psyche.

    But you just sell one strain of mushroom. So anything from you is going to be that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I label my spore syringes but that is because I have 10 different strains. I do not label orders for mushroom pills unless the person orders more than one strain. Then I will label the bag with what strain is in it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, it is worth considering after reading the OP. Never really thought about it.

    As a vendor, thank you for the insight. It is true that when you are getting more than one package at a time, it can get confusing, but i have ordered up to 10 parcels at a time before and have yet to have an issue finding out what is what.
    <br/>
    However, as a vendor, i might start labeling my product discreetly so people know it is my package when it arrives.

    My answer: no, and never. The package is already at risk when examined/opened, sometimes they identify it and sometimes they don`t. Putting a label makes it all too easy for the customs to figure out what it is. Big mistake. I`ll be honest I wouldn`t buy from a vendor no matter how nice they are if they practiced that. A good way to identify what product came from which vendor is to ask them to put a small newspaper clipping with a word/sentence/etc. The clipping`s contents can be then described to the buyer through PGP or whatever means.

    As an RC vendors every single order I send out even tiny sample amounts are always clearly and professionally labeled (along with NFHC and CAS#)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do it for the sake of harm reduction. As has already been said a lot of these powder look the same and people could easily mix them up and end up in trouble. Sure it makes it easier for LE to identify what it is, but if they have already found the package I don't think it makes that much of a difference especialyl since these RCs are grey area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say anything that could pose a risk to the customers safety if improperly identified should be clearly labeled.

    I think that vendors need to be careful with labeling. Say you have three things coming in, two of them look very similar and are from the same country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (hypothetically speaking)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because you're a dumb ass, you went straight to google images and looked up "difference between x and y", and because you really are a dumb ass, you decide to OD (unknowingly) on one of them. Now, you're in prison, hospital or you're just dead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If one was smart, they would just compare the two chems dosages, pick a random bag and take the lower dosage. :/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, vendors could fix this with the use of copy pasta and printing. Just use four digits of the item ID... e.g. for limetless's  100 mg 25i-NBOMe, just add a small piece of paper with "1d61" on it. The buyer should generally be smart enough to figure this out on their own. If two packages end up being the same (looks, smell, amount, country, item ID digits, etc.) wow... uh, you could just do a very low dose of one of them...

    The vndor could put a code (e.g. four digit number) on the inside of the package.  They could then send the buyer an IM with the code in the subject line and an encrypted message with the contents.  Sure adds a lot of work for the vendor for little benefit.

    Why would a vendor ever label their product! Its your job to label it when you get it. Buy a $1 shapie and label it once you recieve the package. If it is opened, having it labeled will make it so much worse

    Because buyers often order more than one thing at the same time.  If you're selling blotters with pictures, it doesn't matter, but when you're talking about generic white powders, it matters, especially when one white powder is active at 100 micrograms and the other at 100 milligrams.

    Sure, but there are obviously ways to label them without being obvious right? I mean I would be pretty freaked out if a parcel came to my door step opened with a sack saying 'COCAINE' on it.

    My opinion on this is no they shouldn't and it's fairly stupid to do otherwise.
