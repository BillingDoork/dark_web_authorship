    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm a long time reader and a first time poster here. I hope this info helps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can confirm from Australia Post reps have said that all mail, regular domestic, parcels, and international mail will be delivered on the Saturday 22nd as it would on a weekday to all addresses to cope with huge demand for postal services during the Christmas period.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also for anyone interested, I have had all my international mail come through last month and hope still to receive my mail for xmas/nye.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fastest delivery I had was 4 days from the UK to oz.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am interested in knowing whether or not any of you other Aus guys have received UK mail this month. Fingers cross for tomorrow or monday. :)

     I still have hope. Parcels are different to envelopes. The amount of Christmas mail coming through at this time would be undoubtedly the biggest amount of mail traffic in the year. I'm in resolution mode with Ivory for a large order and I still hope it comes. Can you give us a source for your information wiggly?

    Interesting, brightens up my Saturday now i know maybe just maybe i'll get an extra xmas present.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's hard to say though if xmas really does delay the mail or not. I think not, or maybe only an extra couple days and that's it. As i received 2 packages from NL this month in record time, one in 7 days and one in 10 days  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything over 2 and a half weeks from anywhere is pretty much most likely lost in my books. (or never sent !)

    I actually couldn't fucking believe it ! NL is actually pretty quick. I'd say average 10/12 days. So all these vendors claiming AUS to hard to send to, i say it's more  a case of vendor not sending. Selective scamming.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chose vendor wisely.

    There seems to be some good vendors for sure, but just paranoid ordering round ones from there.
    <br/>
    I've been looking at reviews from different vendors, and it seems a bit hit and miss.

    When i get a fake PO, i'll try then.

    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again glad to give some good news. It brightened my weekend after this afternoons dissappointing mail. I have a friend who does postie bike delivery in a local area near by. I also got in touch with a good customer rep at auspost before they shut tonight and she could confirm that this weekend was delivery as always, to which my reply was. Fucking brilliant!!!!

    Hey guys
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I didn't get anything today either unfortunatley. I did see the mail man go past on his bike today, I live in QLD today. Luckily I got a some local mates who came through for the weekend... When SR fails go local I guess.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mind u I only order of 1 guy atm, its banging quality and the best customer service if had so far on this site. I've also got stuff on order from a new UK guy atm and he seems proper legit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have confidence in my purchases because I am satisfied with the actions and precautions as well as research I've made before making each and every order and message of contact to a vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honesty, Politness &amp; a Realist attitude are the most important things I think need to be reflected apon whilst buying anything online; especially on SR :P. I haven't had an order fail yet and I don't suspect I will as long as SR remains open and/or uncompromised.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope everyone else is waiting as joyfully and excited for this christmas as I am.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully I can have a white christmas in australia ;)

    Goldust is my most trusted vendor by far for my choice of weekend fun. I have read nothing but good reviews and heard things from friends who have purchased from Jesusofrave also.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Both ship from uk in fully stealth vaccumed heat sealed business envelopes. I currently have two orders sent almost 10 working days ago. I don't FE they don't request it. So I'm hopping worst case is by NYE. Best times I've had is 4 days from UK. So fingers crossed.

    I have 2 outstanding orders from the UK, both now at 15 days and counting. Both sent to a previously unused address. One vendor i have had success with previously, order came in 9 days. The other is my first order with him but his stats are good and feedback seems equally positive. I am hoping that there is a delay somewhere.. however in my experience if a package doesnt show in about 14 days, it never comes. I have not FE for either so at least i am not out of pocket yet.. fingers crossed for Dec 27.. Merry Christmas to those that celebrate it.

    i have a couple of orders with MIMM and Merc that were posted  9 Dec and im still waiting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what im worried about is that i've been reading bout other aussies ordering from the same vendors and getting letters in around 9 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    should i contact the vendors and see whats going on or should i wait a bit longer? if up to me i dont want to wait so i can reorder for NYE if need be
