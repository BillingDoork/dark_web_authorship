    I'm interested in starting to buy pills from the Netherlands, probably 10 at a time, but I'm a bit worried about having to start receiving via Customs. I was wondering if any buyers or sellers who frequently move pills from the Netherlands to the UK could share experience on what your success rate is, and how risky this actually is? Do Customs x-ray packages to check for this kind of thing? And for those of you who've had pills seized, what (if any) follow-up did you get from Customs and/or Police?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks :)

    I am not UK but I am going to give you some generally applicable advice. The customs is not going to x-ray every single parcel that passes them. Usually customs and courier companies x-ray a randomly selected bag of letters and parcels (or bag that a sniff dog has marked) and maybe then it will pass x-ray. Customs usually detect pills in x-ray, believe me, I am from a country with one of the most notorious customs known on SR. It depends on the vendor how well he has hidden the product. If I would ship 100% illegal pharmaceutical pills to someone abroad, I would hide it in a bubble wrap envelope between the paper and the bubble wrap, and put something like an old graphics card in the envelope. The pills would probably show in the x-ray, but when they open the envelope they find the decoy product and they would probably just ignore it. But that's how I would do it. I am not an experience vendor however. Every vendor has his own method of stealth shipping and you should only use reputable vendors with a record of excellent stealth when ordering. When ordering powders like cocaine and heroin vendors should use single or double vacuum seal, when  ordering pharmaceuticals the vendors should be more inventive. That's just my general policy. I guess in UK the customs are not dummies and have all the modern technology at their use.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh yeah, the country I am from is Finland. Drug deliveries are intercepted here often and when it comes to pharmaceutical pills customs detect them via x-ray. How is it in UK I am not sure. Not that different I suppose.

If you think that will definitely fail please PM me and I fill stop instructing other vendors with that advice.

    Through my own experiences i would say from Holland 90%+ comes through. But when it doesn't i have never received any notification at all. I assume your address just gets listed and perhaps international mail to your house is monitored. My thinking for this is that after losing a parcel i had a dummy pack sent and it arrived with a custom stamp and a torn open then re-sealed package. Ive had orders from 2 all the way up to 250 pills in a pack and lost 4 packs with pills from Holland
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Total transactions: 46 (I think at least 30 of these are pills from Holland)
    <br/>
    Total spent: ฿1520.33
    <br/>
    Refund rate: 0%
    <br/>
    Auto-finalize rate: 0%

    Also done about 20-30 packs of pills outwith silkroad and of the 4 i lost they were done outwith SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make of that what you will.

    Thanks for the replies!
    <br/>

    Calzone, agreed that there's probably not a high chance of my parcel being x-rayed, but that it would be nice to have the pills disguised as something else, just in case. Might ask a potential seller if they would be able to do that for me. Then again, if Customs see pills on the x-ray and open the parcel specifically because of that, I'm not sure the dummy product would help any more..
    <br/>

    Spudrik, that's really helpful, thanks. Think I'll go for it, seems like a pretty high success rate :)

    Been doing that for ages actually ;) It's really just because my friends and I fancy giving some good pills a try for a change - would save the hassle of weighing out bombs/caps.
