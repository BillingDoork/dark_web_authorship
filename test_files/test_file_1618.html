    Heyho,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recently grabbed a almost free sample of bud from south africa, I waited now about a month and today it arrived.
    <br/>
    It came in a usual small envelop, the stealth looked bad to me from the outside, inside it was double vac sealed and smell proof but because the bags only took 2/3 of the envelope and there was no paper to hide it, it was slightly curved.
    <br/>
    So now to the sticker it says
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Von zollamtlicher Behandlung befreit
    <br/>
    Deutsche Post AG
    <br/>
    Niederlassung Brief Leipzig"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this means about this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "From custom work freed
    <br/>
    Deutsche Post Inc."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, the question I'm asking what could be the reason they placed this sticker on it and does this really mean it hadn't to pass the German customs? And if yes, why? Are all small envelopes from SA to Germany from custom work freed^^?
    <br/>

    Sounds to me like they did the customs check in South Africa and the sticker indicates it passed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For express couriers like DHL I often see the customs checks somewhere before the target country.Â  I can't think of seeing that for standard mail off the top of my head but looks like that's what happened here.

    Sounds strange, usually letters do not undergo zollamtliche Behandlung. I had this sticker once too (parcel from the US, nothing to do with SR)...
