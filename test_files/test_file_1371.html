    Many years ago (With my clear net site) I had to stop shipping spore syringes to Australia. They just did not make it through Australian customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I now think I have found a way to ship the syringe to Australia and get it through customs and I am willing and able to put it to the test!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I do not know of an Aussie that wants a spore syringe of magic mushroom spores.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I need a volunteer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Must have a good standing on the board and more than 100 posts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First Australian to meet my requirements and IM me will get it for FREE, that is a free syringe with free shipping! I will send you the SR link.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All you have to do is let me know if it makes it and tell me if it was opened, changed, or molested in any way.

    I ordered a spore syringe before SR was around ..... from Holland to Western Australia and it never arrived. The shop i ordered from said Aussie customs prob confiscated it .. but they are required to send a letter to recipient saying that my item would be destroyed but i didn't even get a letter ....? So yeh, if you have a way ... unreal, i'll be your first customer! Just msg me. Cheers, Thx

    Australian law does not prohibit the possession or importation of Ps. Cubensis spores. However, they tend to confiscate them and most Australian's have to buy prints to get them through customs. It is much harder to grow from a print than from a spore syringe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been a spore seller on the clear net and now am a vendor here. I do not live in Australia though I hear it is a great place to visit.  ;D I have a volunteer so the test is set. If it makes it through I will open up the sales to Australia and give my brothers from the land down under the opportunity to enjoy the field of mycology  8)

    Ozzy land is simply AMAZING! I have been there many times and I can tell you this.... having been through thier customs a whole bunch (I realize this is different then shipping there) they are MORE concerned about what kind of FRUIT/FOOD you are trying to smuggle. more then anything else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They have looked at the US and all of our "awesome" bugs that we have gotten from foreign imports ....can anyone say STINK BUGS!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I recall correctly, you can not even travel domestically (within Australia) with any type of citrus fruit etc, because they are that scared of you transporting some local fruit fly to a new area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They got Citrus Fruit Smelling Dogs at all control points. LOL I miss Oz.

    You're dead right. There are even places you can't take grape material out of. Not even state to state, just a specific region...

    I would be interested to see how this turns out, so if anyone does guinea pig this please post back.
