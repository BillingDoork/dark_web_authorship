    I am considering ordering some custom research chemicals from China. The chemicals are not illegal ( yet ) in my country. Should I go ahead and declare the contents in their full glory, assuming that a legal item being imported would have no problem at customs ?
    <br/>
    or should I request my vendor label with something that isn't "Bath salts" but all the same "not for human consumption" and not declare the exact chemical name.
    <br/>

    Thanks for your input everyone

    It wouldn't be a good idea to declare what it actually is. although technically research chems are legal at the moment, they're not really acceptable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This reminds me when mephodrone was legal, one of my friends walked up to a group of police officers and snorted some out the bag thinking he was clever, they knew it was legal but they arrested him and chucked the baggie down the drain.

    If the chems are legal then have them declared as such, a false declaration is as likely to get your stuff nabbed as if it was illegal.
    <br/>
    Get your supplier to include a data sheet with full details of the chems and their legal status, if they are seized you then have a legal route to getting them back or compensation for their destruction.
    <br/>
    I had mephedrone seized and then returned to me before it was banned :)

    I was kind of thinking that aswell... but at the same time, I don't want to be flagged in some system somewhere as bringing in something that is in the grey area and could reach the streets , I guess if I am dealing with super small quantities, &lt; 5g , might be something they wont get all wound up about
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I need a customs insider to give some advice
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Really appreciate everyones input

    you will find that specifying what it is will lead them to seizing it on grounds of analog acts, established in a large number of western countries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honesty is the best policy, but may result in your RC getting seized :)

    Hey dude. See my !Please Help! Big Customs Problem! thread. In short, I got my stuff seized in Eastern Europe, and the cops tried to make a controlled delivery. My recommendation to you is to have your stuff PROPERLY CONCEALED!!! MAKE SURE YOU INSTRUCT YOUR SUPPLIER TO USE STEALTH SHIPPING, instead of just having him throw the stuff in the envelope in plain form. I'd also recommend that you instruct you supplier to label the stuff different that what it really is - use your logic to as what it can be labeled as.

    my supplier is being cooperative so I am leaning towards the stealth methods, I think you just convinced me...
