    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got a nice notice from the "Post" that a normal letter was confiscated, that was labeled with my drop address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I am wondering if there is something like a "blacklist" or such for this drop address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was an international letter from outside the EU to Germany and I just got a letter from the post agency not from the customs. The Order must be one of the missing from quite some weeks ago. Just a small amount of smokeable things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We all have heard from the Post-Camera Sniffing the US and some EU-States do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you think? Is my drop address now on something like a "blacklist"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks for your help!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    take care,
    <br/>

    Certainly a possibility. Germans are notoriously detailed, organized, and systematic. A good thing for sure, but probably not for you in this case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Without any knowledge about the german customs or post, id still recommend lying low for maybe 3 months+ . At least with using the same address or name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helped,

    That is what I thought me, too.
