    1.  What does the tracking number say when you enter it?

    2.  How long does the package stall and does it always stall?

    I don't know for sure but I'm pretty sure they make sure it keeps moving if not even faster. They know some of these people have experience identifying cd's and for a package to slow down or sit still would just raise flags and probably cause alot of people to not sign for it. This is just my thoughts.

    The postal service is unreliable in regards to international shipments. Some stuff takes a week, others 4.

    It would be a horribly in-effective strategy on the part of LE if you could see a controlled delivery on tracking lol.

    Not sure because i always use anon drops and rarely use same addy.

    <br/>
    An undercover LEO will probably try to convince you to sign for something that is a CD.
    <br/>
    A regular postal worker shouldn't really care whether you sign for it or not.
    <br/>
    I recommend only buying things that you dont need to sign for.
    <br/>
    Use a different addy every time.

    Signing for the package is no different then taking the package.  It really doesn't do anything.  This whole rumor that signing matters is just garbage.

    +1 These are all good signs to look out for, and sign/no sign if you take it from them you lose. Total agreement about ordering things you don't have to sign for/recieve at the door so you can know for sure if it is a CD.
