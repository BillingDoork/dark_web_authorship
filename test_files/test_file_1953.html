    From all reports and personal experience, the levels of product security when it comes to packaging seems to vary greatly, and is often not related to a sellers price or popularity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With all this talk and ruminations about letters not reaching their destinations, I think sellers can not only increase their success rates but also increase sales if they develop a better handle on packaging techniques and advertise them as a point of differentiation to their customers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think it's giving away any secrets by saying that a simple dime bag plus vacuum seal is a standard way of securing small amounts.  However, friends, colleagues, and fellow forumers are seeing a whole gamut of other techniques that result in product on the outside of the bag, obvious odors, and product that can be felt through the envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think many buyers (myself included) have often just accepted 'standard' packaging and then dealt with the consequences, but I think it's time sellers really stepped up their game and improved packaging.  There's just too many instances of sellers just thinking that vac sealing is enough.  It's not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another option?  If you can't step up your packaging and absorb the cost within the current sell price, make it a cost option - Double vac seal, intermediate solvent wash for an extra 2 BTC or something.  Some guys already do this, more should.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason I'm bringing this up, is because there is a combative mentality brewing between buyers and sellers where we both should be working together to make the intercept rate as close to zero as possible.  There's always going to be dishonest sellers and buyers and there are ways to minimise that, and customs will always nab a small percentage, but for me anyway a real obvious place where easy improvements can be made is in the packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?

    I'd rather get the best security the vendor can offer no matter what. I shouldn't face more risk because I didn't chip in a few extra bucks. The vendors are at risk as well, best to always go the extra mile and make it as stealthy as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, vendors shouldn't give away their techniques. Suggest that it's good, yes, and stating that it's vacuum sealed several times, also yes. But exact method? Nope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I see where you're going with this, though. Maybe an idea or two can be brainstormed off of the original idea.

    I see where your coming from but surely this is the sellers choice whether he wants to up his game or not, I personally have had no problems with most 'standard' packages and as long as it stays this way i wont be requesting it wrapped in 8 layers of plastic..with obvious international exceptions ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway im sure most sellers would be able to meet the overly paranoids needs for a few extra bc.

    As a vendor I advertise (as general as possible) that my stealthing is 2nd to none. I have been told by my own customers ( and they are right) that I do not charge enough to cover my stealthing tech. If you look at my feedback you can see people talking about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think this helps my sales. I hope it does anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have heard a story from a customer (young guy apparently) where his mother opened a package from me and actually handed him the contents and was so "happy" with him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I feel this kinda feedback is priceless to me.

    Yeah I gladly pay for stealth when available. Reich was the best among all the vendors I tried. It took me a good 5+ minutes to figure out how to find the bag, lol.

    Why wouldn't sellers already being doing everything in their power to ship and pack as well as possible anyway? They are taking a risk as well with a poorly shipped package, so I don't see why they would even need the motivation of it being a selling technique.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway for me personally, as only a buyer, I definitely read the reviews on various vendors regarding their packaging methods before making a purchase. Well respected and well reviewed vendors almost universally receive raves about their packaging. Even if their vendor description page doesn't mention their method of packaging, you can usually see reviews about the appropriateness of the packaging in their comments.

    ... because it could very quickly become rather costly for the vendor, and no customer wants to pay "even more".

    my stealthing is included. It protects me and much as you.

    There was a thread about wondering if it was such a good idea sending weed in the mail a while back, &amp; they listed about half a dozen vendors who do it right by the customers.  One should always take that into consideration in what the feedback says about a vendor &amp; if he takes care of his customers by going the extra mile with safe  packaging techniques.  If  they are good, you will see it in the feedbacks that are left.

    I do choose the vendors by packaging. It would be nice if vendors could always suggest the 'premium' packaging with some extra stuff to be put in the parcel. To make it look like typical ebay-bought shit.

    You may be surprised by this, but just because you have the ability to sell drugs, doesn't mean you instantly have the ability or knowledge to package them.  ::)

    The only sellers not interested in upping their packaging as far as I'm concerned are showing that they don't give a fuck about their customer's safety, or are/will eventually be selective scammers.

      The only sellers not interested in upping their packaging as far as I'm concerned are showing that they don't give a fuck about their customer's safety, or are/will eventually be selective scammers.

     I wasn't aware that I had an issue with my packaging, however thank you kindly for pointing that out. Excellent work. Gold star.

     If a vendor has shit packaging, don't buy from them. Simple.

    And if a vendor has good packaging, buyers shouldn't either have the option of bad shipping or good shipping for "an extra one or two bitcoins," that's almost $20, and that's absurd. Good shipping should be mandatory; it really kind of is if you want to stay in business as a vendor. If you have good shipping, packaging, product, prices, and communication, people will spread the word and they'll increase your sales for you, it's that simple.

     Sellers will do what they want, i just advice people to go with the reputable vendors who package very well, so well you can even get confused at times where it is yourself! which is always good =)

    As i mentioned in this thread (dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=34441), it seems there is no way to know since much of the feedback given on SR is useless.

    Read the threads on Rumor Mill, both for types of drugs and specific vendors themselves. You'll get a lot more in depth reviews and people are a lot more honest and thorough there.
