    High first time doing this and I'm worried.
    <br/>
    Would a P.O. box make any difference or no? I'm not worried about a drug dealer showing up at my door, and I imagine if the law wanted to know who used the P.O. box the post office would have to tell them so... is there a point?

    A PO box would be safer in terms of not bringing heat to your home, however you should know that they have your name regardless (unless you want to open a fraudulent PO box and get a federal offense when the heat comes down) and would be able to find you. The PO box does have one advantage though, if the seller is a jackass and attempts to search you on FB/google or just threaten to expose you for whatever reason then at least he doesnt have your addy, and if you were smart enough not to give your exact name, that either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One thing to take note is if you open a PO box and drugs suddenly start coming to it its pretty goddamn obvious you ordered them, whereas a home you can say that you had no clue.

    If you don't have a good reason to open a PO box then don't open one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good reasons:
    <br/>
    -Roommates/parents/whoever will open your packages for whatever reason and freak out when they find your hello kitty acid tabs
    <br/>
    -People steal your packages when the mailman is too lazy to leave a notice and simply leaves the package in your mailbox or outside your home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're just a buyer and none of those reasons above apply to you then sending them to your residence is the best way to do it.

    You're still on the receiving end if you have it sent to your PO Box.

    hey! short, very urgent question: can I post some infos or questions in the address field, when I buy sth? or where to put it, when I want the vendor to read it? because he didn't answer my messages I sent him... my first order by the way ;)

    Frankly, I would wait for the vendor to answer your questions. This isn't the place to buy stuff "urgently" for the first time. Give it a day or two for a response (some of these vendors are VERY busy and have lots of messages,) or choose a new vendor if he never responds. You also may be asking really dumb questions. Do some research, read the vendors page thoroughly. Don't let urgency cause your security to slip.

    You can but most vendors ignore any messages put in the address field that isn't your address. If it's important and hasn't been answered on their vendor page then just message me, if they don't respond within three days send them another message, sometimes we forget to respond or overlook messages.
