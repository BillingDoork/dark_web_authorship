    Just wondering how possible it would be to send a package of flake back to canada from peru. Assuming a hook up wont be a problem and packaging is good. Do you need to show id to send a package internationally? Are there drop boxes like we have here that u could just drop off the package in?

    if you double vacuum pack the coke in a flat bag that fits in a business envelope, i'd say there's a good chance it will make it to canada.  if you're trying to send weight that won't fit in an envelope, i'd say you've got a much lower chance of success.  peru is the top producer of cocaine in the world, so customs is definitely gonna have a looksie at a higher-than-average number of boxes/packages coming from Peru.

    Into peru isnt so bad but agree with above author. very diffucult. however gettin OUT of peru is harder and I magage to ship 10+Kg's of mescaline out of peru each month, so, its more about who you know and how you know they can bribe who they need to bribe.

    question.. why on earht sending coke to peru? should it be other way around?

    Thanks for the reply. I definitely wont be sending more than what fits in an envelope. Just really hope i can find a good sealer over there. Also is there maybe another country in S.A. that would be much easier/safer to do this? i know argentina is supposed to be relatively safe but im thinkin a little worse on the LE side of things. In peru i heard u can get out of most situations with a fine paid immediately;) but in argentina there not as corrupt. maybe less motivated to give u a hard time though too as there not wanting to shake u down for all ur cash. I have no clue though havent been able to find much on the subject. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated

    Get the jizz out of your eye and open them properly.  Surely if its a return, they will simply recharge and resend rather than risk the resend (and loss) of a sizeable of coke. OR have you never seen anything to do with relavent anything before..?

    Suggestions about argentina are good.  I gotta guy in Peru, he might be able to take an pass on for you for a fee..

    Hey, I live in Argentina, have been here for some years now and I can tell you that Argentina is so fucking corrupt its not even funny. The political moves they pull and the amount of public funds they still is legendary and very well documented yet they still do it because they know  they will just get away with it. As far as drugs, its the same people controlling everything. Its like any other latin american country, right people, right bribes, safe passage. There is also always that crusader who wants to bring everyone down. I believe Argentina is one of the top transit counties right now for coke into Europe currently.
