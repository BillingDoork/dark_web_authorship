    Define risky? there is a definite chance of being caught, more so than on the Mexican border, and there is also a good chance of not getting caught.  Now, I've never brought weed over, but I've brought other stuff, and I've known smugglers.  You chances of being caught, assuming your vehicle, story, background, and stay in canada are legit, is about 1-5% depending on who is working.  If a dog sniffs your vehicle, you have a decent chance of being caught.   They second-stage(dogs, etc.) about 1 out of 20 vehicles, so that is where I came up with the 5% number.  Now, land crossing is definitely an option, a remote place where roads lead from canada to the the US would be idea, cross on foot and have a vehicle pick you up.  The locals use 4-wheelers and snomobiles, so going stealth is the way to go.   Another thing you can do, is do a dead drop just over the border, up in a tree and use a GPS to geocache it.  Then, come back later after returning to canada.  THe people who live along the border fall into two groups, those who hate smugglers, and those who like/are smugglers(but not you) either way, don't count on the locals helping you at all, they will call CBP in 2sec and most of them have dogs which bark when you get near the border.  The only real foolproof way, is to go through the maine wilderness and canoe/kayak through 75km of swam..

    A friend of mine and his dad got their brand new Escalade ripped apart going into Canada because the dad didn't look like he fit the description of someone driving that vehicle. Tore it apart and said have a nice day with pieces laying everywhere. I think it depends on the crossing and how busy it is too, honestly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've only been searched/scrutinized coming back to the US. I've gotten the "please pull ahead to stall number ____, the door will open as you pull up". That was a good time. I think that was just because we were 18 yr olds going up to drink and they knew that haha. They found a few 40mL bottles of some booze and like a 1/4 of pucker. The USBP agents all laughed and said outloud "Damn, I'd wanna hurt someone if I got in trouble for this, mouthwash is stronger" lol. I got my bottle of Morgan back across in a coke 2liter :).

    I've seen them take apart a car for a carton of cigarettes.

    It's NOT as bad as Mexico, as they don't have a giant fence or backscatter x-ray scans of your vehicle at every crossing... but they do at major ones.  There is a native reserve in quebec that sits right on the border, and is notorious for smuggling.  Your best bet is a small crossing, and have a good, beleivable story for your reason to cross.

    How much weight are we talking about here? I have been smuggling all different types of contraband over the Canada/USA border (from Can into US) for over 10 years now so needless to say, I have some experience :P BUT I have NEVER actually smuggled something where it required me to PHYSICALLY cross the border with drugs, 100% of all my smuggling has been done through the postal service but I still have some amazing advice for you if you read my long post :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have shipped to TONS of different countries and talked to other vendors whom live across the world and most vendors will agree that the USA is the easiest country to ship to when it comes to customs issues. This is most likely do to the MASSIVE amount of mail the USPS service deals with daily as the population in the USA is very high, they get hundreds of millions of pieces of mail a day but the USPS is in massive debt and are constantly making cut backs. I heard their is only something like 200 certified postal inspectors (the only people at the mail center whom have authority to open a package) in the USA (I could be way off but that info is irrelevant anyway) There is SO much mail going into the US everyday that they literally don't even have time to fully screen 3% of it.....therefore, the only stuff they really screen is stuff coming in from "high risk" countries (known drug source countries such as Columbia)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, Canada is considered by many countries to be a "high risk" country because, well, we make a shit load of drugs here :P :) BUT, again, there is SO much mail coming through that it is really not hard at all to get even very large amounts through with no issues.....As long as you know how to professional package your stuff, and I'm not just talking about the inside contents of the envelope/box being stealthy concealed (all though that is of course extremely important) I am talking about making the OUTSIDE of the envelope/box look nice a professional, making sure it looks like it is coming from a business rather then an individual sent to another individual. Mail being sent by a business to an individual is scrutinized MUCH less then mail going to individual to individual and that is why pretty much every professional vendor on here makes their packages look exactly like the way certain, real, legitimate businesses package their things and of course the real return address for the real business whose packaging you are copying is used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would NEVER attempt to smuggle something any other way rather then through the mail. It is a million times safer, if you know your shit, it is pretty much impossible to get caught no matter if your the shipper or receiver. I could never even imagine having to DRIVE a car loaded with drugs across the friggin border, just knowing that if that customs agent gets just slightly suspicious my whole life is over their would be no way I could remain calm while looking him in the eye and man haven't you ever watched border wars? It doesn't matter how well you conceal the drugs, they literally have X-rays for cars that will show exactly where the stash is concealed and ALL border crossings have K9 drug sniffing dogs. You may not see them when you cross every time, but trust me, they are on site as the first thing they do when they get suspicious of you and send you to secondary inspection is get the dog to conduct a search, if he alerts (and he will if you have drugs in the car) they will then take the car to the xray machine to be 100% sure the car is loaded and also to know exactly which part of the car to rip apart.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you refuse to smuggle by mail and insist on physically bringing the load over, do NOT just attempt to drive over the border. The Canada/USA border is the largest unprotected border in the world. Their are tons of places where one can simply just walk through the woods to get across but I wouldn't do it that way either.....I would make use of the lovely great lakes and use a boat. I have taken a boat across Lake Errie from ON, Canada into New York State over 100 times (never for anything illegal but hear me out, weed is worth a SHITLOAD in NY and I promise you'll like the info I am giving) EVERY single time I have gone across the lake and pull up to a Marina in the US, there has NEVER been any customs officers or even security present. There is simply a sign saying if you are a Canadian citizen to call a 1800 number which connects you to US customs and you just have to read your passport number out to them and shit. Now, sometimes they will ask you to wait at the Marina just so they can double check you are who you claim to be and such (I have only had this happen once and they didn't even search the boat) If they do ask you to wait, you have at least 15 minutes to drop that shit in the water. Make sure it is completely sealed and attach weights to it so it will sink. They'll come, do their quick checks and then leave. You can then just jump in the water and retrieve your shit (since your docked, it won't be much deeper then 10 feet)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have even taken a boat across the lake into the US and completely forgot to call customs several times, as I am sure many people do, as like I said, you pull up and all their is is one fucking sign saying to call US customs if your not a US citizen lol so I have technically smuggled myself across the border tons of times. each time I easily could have filled the boat with whatever substance I want and get it through fine. I just reveled to you a very easy way to get across the US border that for whatever reason, is really not patrolled much at all. Don't you love how Silkroad connects you with people whom have first hand knowledge of something you'd never learn anywhere else? I know I do :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, sorry the post was so long but I kinda have a reputation for detailed responses, I like to help the community as much as I can :) If I were you, if I wasn't down to use the postal system, it would def be the boat across the lake plan.....especially if you attach weights to the drugs so they sink its pretty much impossible to get physically caught with drugs and the best part is, you don't even need to own a boat. You can rent a boat (or a really fast seadoo) for dirt cheap these days on the lake :) I don't know what part of Canada your in so you may need to make a road trip to get to the lake but no matter how far of a road trip it is, my plan is a million times better then just trying to drive the drugs across IMO.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck brother! If you do attempt this and get away with it, please return to tell us all about it! :)

    wow PharmacyPowder thank you for that post, very helpful. i know this is a secure site but i still don't like to say too much so i will just say that it will involve me going through the border physically. it's not something definite though just looking to get information. thanks again, that was a very informative post and i do appreciate it.
