    So far I've had two cancelled orders. The first was within 24 hours of being placed, for reason of being too new (which I agree with, I'll try again when my stats are better). No feedback option was given on my part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The second time was today, the order had been placed for 3 or so days in processing. No direct message with a reason was given, just the SR support auto-msg. But now its giving me the option to leave feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've sent him a msg, asking if it was canceled for something on my end or his end, and I'll wait for a response. But is it generally frowned upon to cancel an order when its been so long in processing, from the seller's end? Are buyers suppose to ding them with bad feedback? Little confused as to why I've been given this option.

    Well I'd still like to hear some opinions on the matter, as another buyer left 1/5 feedback for the cancellation and scooped quite a few points out of his rating, but here is a follow up to what happened:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got a hold of him, said he got some postal issues/returned packages from previous order, and he was cancelling all orders and laying low for a little bit as a precaution. I thought this was more than a smart move and agreed with it. He'd let me know when he deemed it OK to sell again (not a long wait, high single to low double digit days), and he'd give me a discount when I ordered next time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Works for me, better safe than sorry. I left him 5/5 feedback for the smart precautions he's taking, and to negate some of that rating hit he took from the other cancelled order. Goes to show that patience is a virtue on SR.

    If in the end you recieved a full refund then you shouldn't post any feedback at all.  Feedback should be used to show the vendors track record for sending packages successfully and other related items.  Personally I'd just create a thread mentioning the situation and why it's frustrating.  Leaving a 1/5 for a refunded order is looked down upon from my expirience and others.

    Personally I would either leave no feedback or leave a 5/5 explaining that the vendor cancelled the order but had good reason.  1/5 for this is bad etiquette but it can always change to this later if the situation warrants (which is very rare).  I hate this practice (marking in transit and then canceling) but this will show the community that the vendor is responsible and will make things right if things don't go according to plan.

    OP guy explained himself and it was reasonable, I would leave 5/5.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they just cancelled after 3 days for no reason I would consider a lower score.
