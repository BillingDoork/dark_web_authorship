    Hi,
    <br/>
    Completely dumb question probably, but whats a Delivery Confirmation Number (DCN) ? Do you only get one when you physically hand in the package at the post office as a pose to putting it in the letterbox? In the case of a dispute and no DCN what happens?

    Delivery confirmation is a service USPS offers where a package is scanned as it goes through the system and when it goes out to be delivered - a barcode sticker is put on the outside of the package (usually above or to the left of the address) and the sender keeps the tag which has a long number which they can enter into a form on USPS.com and get the latest info on whether or not the package has been delivered yet.

    You can get a stack of these DCN tags from the standing table/desks in post offices where they have a bunch of such forms and slips and such - they're green. You can then just put the sticker part on any first class or priority package (not a letter-sized envelope though), add stamps to cover the additional charge for DCN (usually 85 cents), and drop it in the blue collection boxes (as long as it's less than 13 ounces), no need to go inside, although if you do go inside and to the counter they stamp the DCN tag for you as semi-official proof that the package was actually mailed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No idea what happens in the case of a dispute and no DCN, so I'll let others weigh in on that. I fortunately have never had a package not arrive and ship everything with DCN, no exceptions, anyways. The 85 cents is worth it for the peace of mind.

    All true, except I am pretty sure the DCN is only 75 cents
