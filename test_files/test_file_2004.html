    Hey All,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With all this talk of SR all over the media I am not prepared to order O/S as it is clear from all the posts either customs are getting better or sellers are scamming. Probably a little of both.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone tell me of a bad experience they have had buying from an Aus seller shipping to Aus? I assume customs dont check domestic mail??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.
    <br/>

    i think i've had 5 (maybe 4) domestic orders on SR - never had any dramas with any of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it doesn't go through customs, so the only way it gets held up is by:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a) vendor does a crap job of packing
    <br/>
    b) u get real unlucky with a sniffer dog - so, see reason a) anyway.
    <br/>
    c) your postman has a nose like a beagle and takes it home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    lighten up dude - if you're too jittery to risk a couple of bitcoins when there's such little risk, then SR probably isn't for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'd be surprised if anyone could give you a "bad experience" - i don't doubt that there's been some lost mail, and maybe some scams, but for me it's been straightforward, and all the vendors that i've dealt with have seemed eager to please.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (so they should when you look at what we pay compared to europeans!)

    Ok since you just started here, curiosity killed the cat.
    <br/>
    First and foremost your bestest link ever https://www.spendbitcoins.com/buy/ anonymous way to buy bitcoins.
    <br/>
    Now what you want to do is have that link setup directly into your silk road wallet, if you click on account there should be a big 159s2e46eqtdjCKJELo4yiEvq4VFoGfdj3  deposit address there. Use that, it will make life a hell of alot easier than having to make your own wallet (takes about 4 days to make your own).
    <br/>
    If you are eyeing a product thats $60 i'd probably put $80 in, just to be on the safe side because the economics here are literally updated every minute so they do change.
    <br/>
    Also if you haven't already i might suggest going into the account page then going to settings, and on the mid left there is a display in dollars vs display in bitcoins (will make life alot easier if you didn't have to convert it in your head)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next you want to choose your product/vendor (shameless plug)
    <br/>
    http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/2d79f40d17
    <br/>
    Here are the ones i can personally vouch for i.e. used their services.
    <br/>
    EnterTheMatrix http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/351ee799c9 He is bascially a veteran of SR and thats a great thing.
    <br/>
    Gold Tops http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/3e582255d5
    <br/>
    BakinBrownies http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/0ff4f4e866
    <br/>
    There are plenty more, just make sure in your account options you have Australia as your locale. Then when you click drugs on the left hand side, you check the domestic box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next is you want to search the forums and look up any feedback on any vendors that you might want to purchase from. Find out as much as you can about them before even thinking about giving them a red cent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok great, now you know your vendor you know their product from the feedback it receives so you wanna purchase something.
    <br/>
    From here you can use PGP but its domestic i wouldn't even bother especially if its for a small thing. Here is a basic thread for starting pgp http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0
    <br/>
    But if you are paranoid use privnote.com its easier for you where as if you learn PGP thats if you want to venture out and get O/S vendors etc.etc.
    <br/>
    So you figured out how you want to encrypt or not your address.
    <br/>
    There is alot of debate on whether to use real names  on the forums and my personal opinion for domestic just use real name or slight misspelling i.e. Blaine Kelly Vs. Blaine Keely
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Great, that's your address out of the way. Because you a new buyer here most vendors will ask you "finalise early" or "FE" as it were. This is because you as a buyer have no statistics to which the vendor can place their trust in you, hence the escrow system.
    <br/>
    The escrow system works just as it sounds its a limbo for money. Once an order has been placed it will go from processing to in transit. When the order has been placed in transit (which is done by the vendor) then you will get two fancy new buttons finalise and resolve. The resolve button won't appear clickable until about 6 days before auto-finalisation (the resolve system is selfexplainatory, i wont go into here).
    <br/>
    But the finalise button is final and once you click it that's it your money is gone (as seen through SR staff, as a vendor though there can be some honesty)
    <br/>
    You should only finalise once you received your product and have sampled it etc. etc. And then you get to leave feedback on that product you just purchased so our next customer comes looking on whether they should buy it or not.
    <br/>
    Also you should finalise in a timely manner i.e. if you got express delivery and you decided to finalise 10 days later not a good thing to do, vendors have memorys.
    <br/>
    Also if you auto finalise it will leave a permanent mark on your record as a buyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're super super paranoid when receiving the parcel/envelope write on it big black permanent marker "RETURN TO SENDER" don't open it for a day, if there is no AFP boot through your door open up it up and burn the package. But that is for only the super paranoid, which can be a good thing especially with all the fucking press this place has gotten. All over the news and everything, its horrible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other questions? Or did i leave anything out?

    Very nice reply. However I would like to encourage all users to ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use GPG regardless of order size or location.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also transferring your btc to instawallet.org (or ideally a trusted btc tumbler) first and then to SR would be a slightly safer method.

    Agree with everything Cozmo says, but suggest you encrypt all your messages.

    I have had 100% success rate from  OS, and 100% success with all but one Aussie vendor (I had super bad luck wit this one dude, losing not only the original parcel, but his two further reships).
