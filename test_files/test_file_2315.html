    I don't know if there are many drops near me. Is it safe to ship directly to your house if you encrypt the conversation and the vendor destroys the messages after shipping?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep in mind this would be a trusted vender (top 2%) and I really don't notice any drops near me.

    Make sure to read lots of forum posts if you're worried about this, as this question is covered in hundreds of threads. Many people (myself included) ship directly to our own residence all the time. Just make sure you follow safety procedures. If you're talking about personal amounts, then you have little to worry about (again, as stated in countless other threads).

    Of course, do your own research and equip yourself with enough information to make an informed decision. For me, shipping home works fine. Don't ever forget that one can never be too safe on SR :).

    Everyone around here seems to say ship it to your own address. I think that's crazy. Why take chances? Unless your house is absolutely squeaky clean, find a drop. There are many threads here about finding one. Just go for a walk and look around.
    <br/>

    You seem to be worried about getting the address to the vendor. I'd be more worried about picking up the mail. That's where anonymity breaks down. Learn pgp, sure, but you're not going to be charged for sending an address to someone, you'd get caught picking up the mail IMHO.
