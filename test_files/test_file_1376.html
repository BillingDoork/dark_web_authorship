    Besides ordering them online i don't think it would be a good idea, because it could be traced backed to the address you purchased them from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Currently I don't use DCN's for priority.
    <br/>
    Any Ideas?

    There's a topic on this. Go online and look for houses that are being rented out. Order to the house and go pick it up. Or if you want to be good about it go meet the owner and act interested in leasing the property, talk for a bit, see the house, FIND OUT HOW CLOSE THE OWNER LIVES.... leave and tell him you will be driving around the neighborhood some to check it out in the next few days...always is good to see if a neighborhood is safe... order the package there and pick it up one of those days. Worst case, the owner finds the package, and you have to try again with a different house. This is how I get my tracking labels.. and pretty untraceable for the most part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've actually thought of going to a mail supply store, and requesting that they order some tracking labels for me to buy, or seeing if they sell them.
