    Hey buddy,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's what I have after weeks of thorough research on the forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. There is a better chance of succesful delivery if you use your real name and address, it is recommended but not necessary.
    <br/>
    2. This depends on your country so maybe someone from Russia can answer this instead. Most places however would require some proof that you actually ordered the product yourself. The easiest way they can do this is by having you admit guilt. That is why it's recommended to never talk to the authorities. talk to a lawyer first. like I said, things probably work differently in your country but this is a guideline.
    <br/>
    3. Sometimes letters, sometimes packages. Again, most succesful deliveries are to a location where your name is already associated with. If unknown names start showing up to an address, that might look suspicious.
    <br/>
    4. The easiest to conceal in my opinion would be anything on a blotter such as lsd. They basically look like paper and are extremely easy to blend into envelopes, sheets etc. Also they are odorless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck on your own research

    As above dude.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1- Real address and name, or trusted family member or friend
    <br/>
    2- Deny everything, anyone can send anyone anything through the post!!
    <br/>
    3- Should just come through your door like a normal letter, unless it is a huge parcel, lol
    <br/>
    4- Like said LSD would be easy. But powders are easily hidden if packaged correctly. And some are really good on here ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know what it is, but i keep reading on some profiles that Russia is a no go or FE early destination. Do your research and find a reputable vendor, perhaps even a domestic one to start with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck and stay safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace comrade ;)
