    So I know all about the vacuum sealing and what not but this will be my first time using usps. It is a pretty short distance so I am not worried to much but I am wanting to mail two hp's of some super dank to some friends and was wondering if anyone would want to pm me some advise on how to ship. Do I just triple seal and then throw it in a priority shipping envelope or what? I have a few good ideas up my sleeve but I don't want to get to into them on here, rather do it on pm's

    Use as thick as plastic as possible for the vac seal, + your going to have to compress it a bit, atleast into a more common shape, hit me up with your ideas if you want some feedback.

    You should use some of the bags that you seal up with an iron.  I think they are 225 or 300 micron bags?  someone is selling them on here for a reasonable price.  yes, definitely triple vaccum seal, and no definitely do NOT use a priority envelope.  are you crazy?  a half pound in a priority envelope is going to stick out like a sore thumb.  It will probably be way thicker than 3 inches not to mention the corners of a priority envelope are nothing close to airtight so if you're concerned about smell this would be a major issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    User a flat rate BOX to ship them, and if anything, given your talking about moving a pound in two shipments, a better idea would be to SWARM each HP by breaking it down two 4 shipments of individual ounces through priority, 4 ounces shipped individually for each half pound.  That way if one package gets seized you stand to lose 1/4 of the weight for each half pound vs. losing the whole thing. This is how real deal smugglers move shit through the mail when they make bulky moves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If everything is going to the same address then swarming it like that is could look sketchy and pop a flag or 6, hah, but I'd still recommend at least breaking into two shipments for each half pound.  better yet, have the friends you're shipping to give you a few addresses so they can each receive a piece of the whole.  Then you can do the originally proposed method of four shipments per HP, so four 1oz shipments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ship each of the four on different days for each HP.  I would recommend doing 2 1 week and 2 the next.  That's my .02.  good luck with everything

    Real but falsely named business address? super confused. I don't want to have to break these down because they will consistently be going to the same address. I am only looking to do this temporarily as I cannot drive atm. And I wasn't saying I would put it in a envelope I was just using an example. I am looking for tips to make it look less suspicious packaging wise

    Just make sure to use addresses that are REAL, not just random numbers and a random street name that may or may not be in your town.

    why can't you just do it like an ebay purchase and use their box? I mean people send other people shit all the time and its just domestic I don't see why it has to be from a business. I would think it is sketchy to use anything fake.

    It doesn't HAVE to be from a business, but an actual address as advisable.

    look up that x-ray tip, read the JanetReno thread....order from another vendor if you can, order it express if time is of the essence....then see how its done and try to emulate....I dunno, like Delta said, its kind of to each his/her/their own, everyone has their own highly coveted method/craft.....Delta put it very well, think outside the box, just for gods sake dont use a priority/express flat mailer envelope to ship a HP!  That's trafficker suicide.haha, good luck tho

    When I would ship weed. I would triple seal a HP then hide it inside of some sort of item. Then just ship it in a USPS Flat Rate box 2-3 days delivery time. Be careful not to get any marijuana scent on the outside of the vacuum sealed bags or on the box. Otherwise all of the time spent sealing it is pretty much wasted. :)

    Little late here, my bad, a lim-qoute is technically defined as either
    <br/>
    a)The honor of having your post quoted by Lim in the dkn....dot onion forum or
    <br/>
    b)The joy one feels when quoted by Lim in aforementioned forum, especially when Lim agrees with the post in quotation :)
