    Just wanted to get a poll from any fellow Canadians on here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have any of you EVER had a sr package never arrive that was shipped Domestically, From Canada To Canada?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If so were you ever contacted by Canada Post or the Police either in person or by phone or mail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    I've had about 20 domestic orders and have not received only one. It was a sample from a new vendor who I later found out had complaints about his poor packaging so It was probably either stolen or just confiscated or w/e.
    <br/>
    I haven't received any letter or phone call so I have continued to use the same address successfully so It wasn't a big deal at all and considering it was just a sample I guess I'm pretty lucky.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your expecting a package and it hasn't came don't worry some times it just takes longer than usual.
    <br/>
    My last order was supposed to arrive in 2-4 days but took 7 days so sometimes it varies I guess.

    Yeah I can see 7 days, but as mentioned in my other thread my domestic Canadian package was apparently shipped from a province 2 provinces away, on the Monday before last Monday, it's not Saturday night, so that's like 13 days ago or 10 business days (mon-fri). The seller reshipped it with free tracked shipping this time. He still thinks the first one might come but considering the length of time and that it was never leaving Canada, I don't think there's a chance in hell it's still coming. I haven't been contacted either in person or by phone/mail by anyone about it either. Was wondering if with terrorism these days they must at least really randomly X-ray some domestic packages considering some going from province to province must use planes sometimes and with terrorism they must occasionally use X-rays or sniffer dogs on conveyor belts at least looking for bombs, even randomly.
