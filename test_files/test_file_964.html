    OK,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I ordered a gram of H from a west coast vendor, Something got fucked up and either myself or he messed up the zip-code on the package, we're still trying to figure out what happened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ANYWAY, my package was sent from the west-coast, to the mid-west, and then back to the west-coast because of "insufficient address." I've called USPS trying to get the package back, but as of now it's at the dead-mail/Mail Recovery Center, and USPS says that I will have to go in to my local PO, give them address and phone information to file a claim to retrieve my package that's at the MRC.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HERE IS MY DILEMMA:
    <br/>
    USPS says that the items at the MRC are "scanned to see if any items of value  are inside, i.e. credit cards, checks, money orders." They are then opened to check if any information regarding the proper "to" address can be located. My question for you guys is: by scan does that mean they x-ray, and do they do this for *all* packages? And by opening, would they open envelope after envelope to get inside of a package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this package was sent express, and the vendor noted that the packaging is as follows: "The stuff is inside another envelope with your name and address on it. Inside that env. it is wrapped in layers of paper so as to look/feel like a document of some type so it should pass basic inspection as just some paperwork. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ANYONE, please help, with either advice or experience in recovering dead-mail packages. I'm assuming my package will pass a basic inspection, it looking like genuine paperwork. But an x-ray will clearly show a plastic baggie...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks,
    <br/>

    Let it go. Not worth the risk, IMO.

    I found this: http://failuremag.com/feature/article/point_of_no_return/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "All the incoming letters are sorted by a high-speed scanner that has a magnetic eye; it looks for indelible ink, which generally is an indicator of important documents. “A letter does not have ‘value’ unless it contains money, checks, an insurance policy—that kind of thing,” says Long. Any letter not identified by the magnetic eye as being potentially valuable is put on the fast track to a super size paper shredder. “To protect the privacy of the mail we’re required to shred it,” continues Long. “If you ever mail anything that didn’t get there, don’t worry. It’s shredded somewhere.”"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So as long as it doesn't have indelible ink on it, maybe they won't open it.

    True, so they are all x-rayed at some point. I suppose the only hope I have is that they haven't gotten around to x-raying the package yet. Currently talking with vendor to find out exactly how the product was packaged. Plastic Baggies = no, but say it was wax-paper wrapped and hidden in laminated ID card, then I would have a better chance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Letters and parcels that are determined to contain items of value are opened in an attempt to identify an address where the piece can be forwarded or returned." So assuming they scan the express mail envelope and find the additional envelope and paper, they would open the express envelope and look at the address printed on the secondary envelope inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's say I did fill out a request form to have it returned, and that they did find the heroin. Should I expect a controlled delivery? Or is filling out the form reason enough to get an arrest warrant?

    No actually I changed my post. They don't x-ray it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not going to tell you to go after this package, as you might get busted, but it seems there's a good chance they won't open it, and if you call them and claim it, they will simply deliver it to you.

    Thanks a ton Astor. I am going to meet with my shipping-address-person and discuss this. Pretty sure we'll go for retrieval.

    Good luck man. :)

    Let us know how it goes. I'm pretty interested and I'm sure a lot of other people are too, since this could happen to any of us.
