    Hello there SR,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First off I would like to say thanks to the road for making my recreational drug use that much better and also to you forum goers who make everything SO much easier to manage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question today concerns an order that I placed about 12 days ago for a small amount of Cannabis that was shipped to my PO Box. Now I have had 2 orders make it through successfully, one which was all the way from Germany, but now the one I least expected to fuck up has gone haywire...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After letting the vendor know my product was not received within 6 days (his minimum time before contact) he gave me the tracking number. That is when we both noticed the last step in the tracking was noted as, "Delivery status not updated." The tracking history shows that the package made it from the initial location and then finally to my location, but never arrived at my PO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is when he suggested that I call the PO and voice my concerns for my package. I did so and was required to give my name, phone number, and the address to which I had shipped it to. After doing so I felt as if I had made a mistake thinking that a bit of weed wasn't worth my security, but I went along with it and the customer service representative opened a ticket in which I would have a call back about the whereabouts of my package in a business day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I am at the point of paranoia and I was hoping for some assurance/advice/experiences from fellow members of the road...
    <br/>
    Have any of you experience this when not receiving a package? Did I do the wrong thing by reporting the matter to the post office? If there was something suspicious found in my package and the post already found out about it wouldn't they have let me known?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please help as I am very frantic at the moment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.
