    I really wouldn't worry too much. Check out my UK buyers thread and make sure you order from a reputable dealer who packages their product properly (dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11298).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you live with parents / housemates, I would be more concerned with them intercepting your mail. That, or a dodgy postman.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Royal Mail ships hundreds of millions of packages every year, the chances of an internal package being confiscated are minimal. And the police generally don't arrest people for a gram of cannabis. As long as you are not on probation or a drug cessation order, you have little to fear.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With regards to having an order shipped to an alternative address, I'm afraid that I have little experience in this regard. However, many sellers won't post to a PO Box. If you have it sent to a friends address, you also stand the chance of them or their housemates ripping you off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have stacked up nearly 40 orders on SR in the last year from all over the world; every single one has arrived to date. Just use your common sense and make sure you vet any seller on the forums before placing an order. If anything 'feels' suspicious, take your money elsewhere. At the very least, don't finalise early (Although you'll need to build up a decent purchase history before you can flex that right).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, good luck!

    Hey man thats for the reply really helps but damn man im used to pay £10 GBP per 1 gram of weed and on here some can be 2.5 bitcoins per gram which to me seems very expensive  but never the less im not to botherd.
    <br/>

    Nope, and never will at the prices they charge. That said, the reviews regarding quality, shipping etc seem to be pretty positive. I would, however, be a little skeptical about the validity of the strains they claim to stock. Either they have the best grower connections on SR or are masterful hype barons. But given the fact I have never purchased from them, my opinion is completely unfounded and wholly due to my discrimination of vendors charging exuberant amounts for dried flowers  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But hey, SR is a free market and if you have the coins to spare, spend them with whomever you fancy. Just make sure you pop into the UK buyers thread and let us know how you get on  ;)

    iCRS Don't worry at all  :)
    <br/>
    Have been a member for 3 months now and all my weed orders have arrived successfully and quickly too. There are some real good vendors out there and as BDF says check their feedback and stats before buying. Yes some prices are really expensive here but I would imagine it's quite good weed although would never pay over 2btc a gram to be honest but NSNS has quite an extensive menu :). Also I think quite a few sellers have run out so there are not too many vendors to choose from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also try to choose a vendor who does not ask for FE and keep your funds in escrow until you receive your goods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck for your first purchase - very exciting !!!!

    NSNS is a good lad, I had blue cheese a few months back and it was a top quality smoke, bone dry and covered in crystals. The BB Haze he currently has is a decent price. He will also cut you a deal for quantities (I think). Try and buy in slightly larger quantities and have some money in the long run, even if you have to get product imported, it's pretty safe, Leckermann (I think that is spelled right) does decent bud at good prices, just untick 'domestic'.
