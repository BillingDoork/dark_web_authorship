    You can't put a animal just like that in a box on the mail.
    <br/>
    The cat will scream.
    <br/>
    It can get really cold in the the belly of a plain.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only just and right way is to look for a import export specialist that has made it's business from transporting animals over the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think twice !
    <br/>

    Be wise !

    That seems so cruel...

    <br/>
    "seal it in one layer of plastic or two? Im going to give it some food and water and a can of air. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do you even give it a can of air?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It may also growl and try getting out of its cage because it's going to be hungry / cold.

    Someone needs to seal you up a couple times, shove you in a box, and ship your ass off to some piece of shit in North Korea that will keep you locked up in a steel cage the rest of your life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's cool though. We'll throw in a can of oxygen and pray that customs doesn't find you..

    You don't even need to do any of those fancy things. Stuffing it into a large enough envelope should suffice. I mean, it's no problem if there's no food, the shipping time shouldn't be so long. Starvation builds character.

    Post-Op Disclaimer/Edit-tor-REAL:Â  Be safe people.Â  Read #4.Â  Being a smartass in a humorous post was warranted and I like humor (who does not?).Â  Not meant to poke funny haha's at anyone until they bleed... just to get attention.Â  Poke back.Â  I have armor :)Â  I hate things like: People not knowing about things (purchasing, knowledge, etc)... Help those guys out.Â  Don't chastise a sincere request from a newer one w/o more knowledge.Â  If the best you can tell him to do is "F-Off"... that's your best.Â  Congrats!Â  So take your own advice.Â  Inspirational Quote: "United we stand; Divided we ran" ..
