    Seller marked in transit last Sunday Aug 18th and today is Saturday the 24th and its a no show. I'm not positive my mail came today but most likely did. I hope to hell it comes. Has anyone else experience similar delays? Something else arrived on Thursday from Kentucky that was sent out Monday so this really shoulda arrived Friday.  :-[ :-\  :'(  :( &gt;:(

    Just relax. This kind of thing happens all the time. The vendor may not have actually sent it when he said he did or the USPS is being slow as fuck.

    Dude, you are being way impatient here and I am sure the vendor would explain exactly what I am about to explain to you. You ordered from NY state, that is literally as far east away from Cali as you can get, not only that, but you are down south as well! As a vendor that ships out of Ontario, Canada (less then a 2 hour drive from NY state) California and Texas take BY FAR the longest for my packages to arrive to. This is because Cali is as far West as you can get, and Texas is as far South and you live way down in the SOUTH WEST so it's a double whammy for you.

    I have NEVER had something make it to Cali in the time frame you have posted (although Canada Post is much slower then USPS, once it hits the states, which it does it two days, the USPS takes control) so you just need to kick back and relax brother :) It will arrive soon and messaging the vendor flippin out about where its at won't make it arrive any quicker  8)
