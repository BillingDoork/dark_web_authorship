    Hi everybody, I've been a lurker on SR for a while now and have now decided to see if I can pick some of guys brains. I'm going to use this thread as basically my manual or atleast i hope as a strong basis for my packaging technique.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok so here goes, I'm planning on setting up a domestic mail distibution cannabis club, in order to supply medi users (and some recreational) who otherwise wouldnt have access to meds. So i assume your thinkibg get to the point and this is what i'm askin from you guys and tht is basicallly any information on how to package cannabis buds aswell as kiefs hashes and concentrates. Any inforrmation atall will be great even little tid bits out of your head as well as theories would be greatly appreciated. Specificly info on vac packing methods and prices etc would be fantastic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well thats enough from me I'd love to hear from you guys.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace and One Love

    It's simple.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.Order from some domestic vendors
    <br/>
    2. Study their packaging methods
    <br/>
    3. ????
    <br/>
    4. PROFIT!!!

    Thanks for the reply i would +1 but I haven't a clue how and yeah i would do but most of the prices are stupid i mean i know street prices arent great but SR seems extremely inflated but yeah it may be an option the plan is to distribute for just over cost price in order to cover overheads like packaging etc
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone could let me know whether vac packing noticably diminishes quality as I've heard it can crush the trichomes however most of the bud i smoke myself is from europe so would assume that shit gets vac packed

    You should probably know how to use SR before you even consider selling here.

    420Meds gave you the right information.

    if you plan on distributing large quantities I recommend a commercial can sealer, like vegetable can, and a commercial dishwasher, may cook the contents a bit, when you pop the smell is crazy...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For small quantities I recommend USPS First Class. I recommend laying it out flat, then Triple Heat Sealing it - not vacuum, and then wrap in paper towels and printer paper. then put in a thick privacy envelope.. The reason I recommend this is USPS first class super safe and super cheap because its completely operated by machine. the only time first class is handled by hand is when they put it in your mailbox. They are sorted into bags and into bins of thousands, so the police dogs are just overwhelmed and clueless anyway.

    Excellent info Tizzat much appreciate, any chance you could recommend a good heat sealer or point in tge right direction and in regards to quantity I'd most likely be sending ounce an half ounces so not particularly large amounts what method would you recommend for these amounts ?

    Edit: I'm also base in the UK anyonr have any ideas as to how Royal Mail sort their parcels and letters ? I used to work for a mail company and we used to sort by hand but it was all commercial mail.

    Royal mail uses the same systems, the Royal Mail service buys the same equipment, the only difference in some small towns royal mail still hand sorts and at large corporations its up to the corporation to sort there mail. So say your in an industrial building in london, the royal mail drops it off at the main building and its up to the property manager to hiring a sorter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not an expert on this but i watched a couple you tube videos about the process, this info is public knowledhe.

    Yeah thanks Tizzat think I may have just watched the same video as you I'd completely forgotten about the m sorting machines I used to help run one :/ thanks for the help though you've given me a lot to think about and research. I think the smaller amounts will be fine just getting heat sealed but larger orders will need to be 'canned'
