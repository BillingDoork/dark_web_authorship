    they can't open packages without warrant they would bring a dog and let him smell a bag and he would smell these letters and if the package the one who needs to get through is closeby the dogg will smell that too. then they will examine them and get a warrant to search them.

    well the only thing that this will do in my opinion is get teh police on your trail if they aren't already.  You would have to send all those letters from a bunch of different bluebox mail drop boxes, if even half of those have cameras on them then they will see you going around to a bunch of different drop boxes putting in these,"Decoys." If you send it all from one location then they will surely be on your trail in no time.  This seems like it would cause more harm then it would reduce.  It would rise more attention then it would settle it don't you think?

    This I would love to see. If you got 100 members to send 10 packages each on the same day to the same address, White house, Nasdax offices, Police stations ect, it really would be a hoot.

    This is the best thing i've heard in a long time, send them all to Australia, that will keep our supposedly tuff customs officers busy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    by the time they get warrents for all the letters, it will delay searching other items and possibly allow them to get through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    even if its not going to help other packages get through, it will def keep the fuckers busy

    This would be the best idea. A shake flour bomb in 100's of mailboxes around the world/Australia so all mail posted through that box for weeks to come will reek of weed... Your right, it won't do much in the short term but if this were to be an organized effort that kept on recurring I think it could stretch the resources of our magical x-ray visioned customs officers to the point that it's a waste of money to inspect regular envelope mail so they could focus much more effort on the big packages.
    <br/>
    I've got a couple shopping bags of shake that I've been meaning to use in cookies for months. Would be pretty hard to organize something like this &amp; it would be pointless if only a couple boxes get shake bombed... Who's in?

    You would be better off to get the smelly chemicals in weed ( Terpenes ) in bulk, and just spray them inside the mailbox just a squirt ever day.  I would consider that to be much much cheaper, and definitely not illegal.

    While funny and amusing to think about... absolutely HORRIBLE idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets say it worked, everything is flagged, dogs go nutz, cops are called and everything is halted and searched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At least in the USA, you know what will happen?  Some government types will hear we have a drug terrorist group threatening the countries god and children, it would cause an uproar etc  They will borrow more money the government doesn't have and search everything for years, pretty much making it harder to send the goods we actually want.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    id sacrafice a quater to the cause, thats 14 boxes on my end, we need to make sure they are going international though.

     You would be better off to get the smelly chemicals in weed ( Terpenes ) in bulk, and just spray them inside the mailbox just a squirt ever day.  I would consider that to be much much cheaper, and definitely not illegal. AND then you wouldn't have to pay any postage or leave a loose hair anywhere.

    This is a fantastic suggestion.

    But I think, here in Australia at least, this could get you into trouble.

    You'd probably be charged with mail tampering.

    No dog is trained to smell every different drug there is today, they only pick up scents that they have been specifically trained to pick up on. The only thing you really have to worry about is weed, for obvious reasons. Other than weed, pretty much anything else should make it through smoothly, as long as you make the package/envelope as standard and typical looking as possible.

     While funny and amusing to think about... absolutely HORRIBLE idea.

     <br/>
     Lets say it worked, everything is flagged, dogs go nutz, cops are called and everything is halted and searched.

     At least in the USA, you know what will happen?  Some government types will hear we have a drug terrorist group threatening the countries god and children, it would cause an uproar etc  They will borrow more money the government doesn't have and search everything for years, pretty much making it harder to send the goods we actually want.
