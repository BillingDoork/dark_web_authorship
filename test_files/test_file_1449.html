    Ive done I think 7 or 8 orders on SR so far an I think the longest I had to wait was 5 business days. All orders has been within EU. I ordered some goodies from France that was sent the 5th July and it has not arrived yet. Since its going to a neighboring country I though I would get it a long time ago. Do you consider a package lost (to customs) if it takes this long? I saw on this vendors profile page that it says you get refund or reship after 2 weeks, so Im guessing that means after 2 weeks its most likely gone?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas here? Would rly appreciate some input.

    Postal system can be slow sometimes. But after 2 weeks it's most likely gone.

    However, I hope your package arrives ;)

    Depending on both the Country the package is shipped and both the one the package is received things can vary greatly. They can also greatly vary by randomness, even inside EU.

    <br/>
    I sometime had package arrive in 2 days, more often 3-4, but it has happened that some took more than two weeks to arrive. This last happens mostly when the package seems like to bounce from one place to another (yes, it can happen).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't lose faith yet, but if after 2 weeks it doesn't come then the probability of not coming at all increases, that's true.

    When it took more than 2 weeks, was it within EU? What do you mean by bouncing around?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is a package from France to Spain. Spain is pretty slow in many ways so I wouldn't be surprised if it turns up after 3 weeks or so. Its a small package so it shouldn't be a big hold up at the customs though. Very strange...

    Yes, it was within EU.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for what "bouncing around" means, it means that it for example goes to a post office, then returns back, then it goes to another and so on. Sometimes it can happen.
    <br/>
    Spain, as Italy, are very slow mail points and quite disorganized. These sort of things are to be expected sometimes.

    It has been a long time but who knows what could happen. I once got some seeds sent to me within the EU from the UK. The seeds didn't show after 3 weeks so the company reshipped them. The next week I got the original envelope and the reship the day after. So both packages came from the same exact place, one took a week and the other took a month.
