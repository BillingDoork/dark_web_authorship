    I'm not sure if this type of discussion is allowed here or if other vendors would want to give out their techniques, but when ordering bulk RC's from overseas, how safe is it to have it sent to your home?

    It is extremely unsafe to get anything bulk ordered to your house. If you have drugs (even recreational amounts) at the address you are ordering to, I recommend scrapping the idea entirely or at the very least, considering another address.

    Thanks, it would be imported into the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been looking at the FD&amp;C act and it seems there are alot of requirements and registration needed for those who are importing it for commercial purposes. It seems that further distribution, manufacturing, etc, for research use is exempt from all the red tape, so I would assume it would be also for personal use. Although I could see them seeing receiving bulk amounts (although I'm not interested in very large amounts) as being an indicator for commercial activity and would want to get involved.
