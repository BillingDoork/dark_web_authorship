    Hey guys.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I have finally received the package from my first order on SR. It was an express but took almost 5 days. I had ordered it last wednesday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I received today, no signature required, but with that long wait I am suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Advice? How long should I wait before I open and pull off the RTS sticker that I put on there?
   </dd>

    Was it an international package? Sometimes things get delayed. Did you check the tracking number (if it has one) to see how long it sat where? This isn't uncommon on an international order of course. If it was a domestic order it's possible the source took his time mailing it.

    The vendor probably sent it priority and kept the extra cash you gave him for express. they do it all the time

    It was US domestic express.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It said express on the package, so def wasnt sent priority. I see he mailed it @ 6pm on wednesday so it went out thursday. Shouldve been to me by the latest on Saturday. But I only received it today so Im a bit sketched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Package is still unopened with "RTS" sticker on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How long till Im good to go you guys think?

    Whats an rts sticker? never heard of that. just put it in your car, leave it there for a day or 2. if you do get popped, say you put it in your car and you were going to take it back to the post office when you had some free time. i think your being overly paranoid, but that can be a good thing. never can be too cautious. it was probably just a delay. i  think if they would of done a CD they would of waited for you to be home then tried to hand it to you directly and tried t get a signature.

    Well, I waited about 3 hours and there was no suspicious activity.. I decided to take the risk and open the package.  Do you guys think Im safe?

    What I meant by an RTS sticker is the one I put on there just in case they arrived at my door.

    Uhg, I hope I didnt act to hastily here...

    I would bet you're fine..if you google usps express you find horror story after horror story about the screw ups with overnight packages..and remember that mostly when it comes to ratings on companies and such that its easy to find the unhappy people..they post all over..when it goes right no one thinks about it twice.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But really..I would not sweat it, it arrived late, that in itself is not unheard of at all...

    Haha, putting an "RTS" sticker on a pack isn't gonna do much once you've accepted it. It just took longer than usual bro, relax.

    Pretty sure RTS = Return To Sender.  They probably messed up delivery and were going to return to sender but then sorted it out and came through with the delivery.  SMH at USPS.  Do like I do and open the package in car near a public trash and pitch the package and head home.

    If it was a CD they would definetly insist that you sign, and they would be rushing to get your package delivered within the general delivery time.  Considering how late it was and that you didn't sign anything, I'd say have a Disco dance with your package, then open tenderly, as to not scare it 8)

    So you already got the package and NOW your worried about a CD? lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they were going to bust you they would do it right when you had the package in your hands not a few hours later after you've destroyed the evidence lol.
