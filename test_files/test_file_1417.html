    I looked up the tracking for a parcel and the status is :Processed through sort facility, Date and time 00/00/0000 00:00 AM, Location: ISC New York, NY (USPS).
    <br/>
    I know that ISC is customs, so if my status is "processed through sort facility" and the location is ISC NY (customs), does that mean that the parcel cleared customs already, or does the package still have yet to go through customs inspection?

    Also going through the same situation
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have read that once it "Processes through Sort Facility ISC (New York)" that it has past customs, ready to do be sorted and delivered.
    <br/>
    Been waiting for about 9 days now... could be due to the July 4th holiday?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be patient and it should clear soon, that's what I'm doing.

    it doesnt really mean that it has or hasnt. ive had several be processed through. always got them within
    <br/>
    a couple days of being processed through. except for one that took another 2wks after that message.
    <br/>
    although i think that was due to slow postal service. unfortunately if it is stopped they are not going to
    <br/>
    tip you off with the status. they know someone is expecting it so they will just leave it saying put through.
    <br/>
    but in most of my exp. it means it went through and is on it's way. hope that helps

    It could mean that it's left, however I wouldn't count on it until I see a scan in a different city.

    From my experience and understanding of how tracking works its been logged going into ISC, once it is released it will say "outbound". If it hit customs on a friday or today then you might have it in your hands as fast as Tuesday or as long as 3 weeks, after 3 weeks you should call it although ive had items from china stay in customs for 2 months and then make it to me.

    It is never smart to talk about such big amounts of illegal substances stuck in specific customs offices at specific times, especially when you name the exact substance and the weight. That comment is extremely incriminating for you and your friend, and not to mention your tipping off customs agents!!

    Once you see a scan in a different city you are 99% in the clear unless it ends up being a controlled delivery.  I don't get why people stress out about this question, remember there is a likelihood of dog sniffers at most main sort facilites, say I live in Chicago and my package cleared ISC new york, what if my package gets sniffed out at the Chicago sort facility?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All in all it ends up to how you setup your drug drop, if you set it up anonymously and pick it up correctly then you will have minimal things to worry about.

    It seems like a lot of things have been going through ISC lately and sitting there a few days.  Experienced a few instances of this.  Don't fret, they usually move ~48 hours.
