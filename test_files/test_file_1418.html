    I am not sure if this was due to the mailman or my vendor, but I received a package that was opened. There was a visual barrier and no identifiers were otherwise present.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ditched the box and packaging ASAP, yet I'm not sure what to make of this.  I am not a major buyer.  If they were spying and seizing, why leave the drugs in the package and do nothing?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this just a case of a rough mailman?

    They probably wouldn't send the drugs on through to you if they detected them.  They would've seized the package.  If you haven't had a knock on your door yet, it was probably just some damage that happened along the way.

    How do you know it was opened?  Lots of stuff come in damaged because it gets thrown around.

    One thing a lot of people don't think about is.... not all mail men are out to get you. Though don't let this idea change your behavior. If it were me personally delivering mail, and I found a package with drugs: 1) I'm not going to take it, I'm not an asshole. 2) What if you report it, or take it, or something along those lines, and this person at the house is violent and assumes you did it? Stealing from a violent drug dealer? No thanks. 3) What if the mail man supports drugs, and literally, does not care at all if you order them. This would be me if I was a mail man. Of course I can't go telling my route people that I don't care if they order drugs, but if I ever accidently found out, I wouldn't ruin someone elses day/freedom over it.

    Iv had packages show up that look like they had bombs go off beside them..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just last week, I order'd a Red resident evil limited edtion xbox360 elite from Gamestop. When UPS drove up and handed me the box, itlooked like he dropped it out the truck going 100!! lol/ I even said, "sir there is expensive electronics in here if something is broken im sure the box was not sent this way from gamestop," He was a young cool guy he said well if u want go ahead and Open it and make sure its all together, and i'll even wait 10 min and eat my lunch for u to go make sure it works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So sure enough it was all fine and the actual XBOX inside the fucked up box was untouched. So i went and told him it was all good, and he said that many company let their electronics get ruiened by simply not putting a Certain handle with care sticker. He was gonna wait while i called gamestop and send it back if it was a issue..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sO Its the mail allot IT GOES THRUGH HELL AT TIMES, think of all the people who really dont wanna be there just chunking packages around and not caring, just getting in their hours..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv never had a package opened at all though, (KNOCK ON WOOD) 60 TRANSACTIONS AND ALL SMOOTH..

    I believe that if something was going to happen to you, it would of by now. LE are not going to do a CD and then give you time to clean your house.
