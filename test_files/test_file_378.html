    The risk depends on you as an individual..
    <br/>
    Do you regularly get other legit packages? If not you should start to order some shoes , clothes regularly etc
    <br/>
    Is this domestic ? If not, not to worry but order lots of legit items from abroad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try have different addresses to ship to , never deal from the same address or continue to hold the stuff at the same address that has been delivered to.

    You may also want to look at drug asset forfeiture laws in your state.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are receiving drugs at your home, they can make an application to seize the property under proceeds of crime acts.

    Get a little space and setup a PO Box or UPS box. Even if its under your name, at least it distances your possessions.

    Just make it look normal and dont tell ANYONE your doing it through the mail and you will be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMO using your house to receive 1 package per week is smarter than using a drop if the drop is just in your name anyways. People receive packages at their home ALL the time and the weight involved here wont mean a massive package, just a mid sized box. Postal workers arent proactively looking for drugs, they stumble upon that shit. So just act normal and they wont give a shit. Its a 9 to 5 job for them, they deliver your mail and go home. They arent cops, they dont wanna be cops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dont rent a mom and pop shop mail drop to receive 1 package per week and nothing else, that looks fishy and those places WILL be proactive to make sure their locations arent being used for drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dont tell any associates that your receiving packages through the mail and destroy all packaging as soon as it arrives and that way if anyone is busted/you have a falling out with your crew, they cant have anything on you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have worked with customers who receive LARGE packages through the mail and their drop hasnt changed in over 2 years. Just play the part and make sure your working with competant shippers and you'll be ok.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do check your proceeds of crime laws though like I mentioned .. using your house may be alot to risk if it can come up for seizure. Contact a lawyer and get a real legal opinion.

    You dont have to rotate addresses at all lol .. use 1 address and use it like nothing illicit is occurring.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All I am suggesting is that address maybe not be a mom and pop store if your only receiving 1 package per week from the same state like clockwork and that you also look into what kind of forfeiture laws your state has if you are going to go ahead and use your own home.

    I honestly don't know any of the risks involved I always try to minimize it as I am heavily invested in other "High Risk" areas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is possible I think that transporting from one location everytime would lend LE the ability to pattern it than just pull you over with fictious reason and bust you for the weed and possibly linking it to other deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I notice cops don't just show up anymore, it is almost like they have a lot more surveilance than usual, and I think it is that they are actually hackers from their computers.  Some of them anyway coordinating other officers.  And the "hacker police cars" "probably" get homeland security and FBI tips for who to suppress, arresst, and deny freedom.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Goodluck in finding true freedom economic.  Just learn when to quit and learn to use cach systems.

    I do not have experience receiving 2lbs of weed a week but I do have experience receiving 5+ packages a week with no suspicion (that I know of) from my mail man as I see him often because he comes around the time I take my dog out for a walk and we exchange convo's on an almost daily basis about weather or w/e... I have lived in the same place for almost 3 yr and have only used the road for around a month.5's time but previously to this place I buy all kinds of stuff off the internets so receiving that many packages, especially as xmas nears, is not really suspicious for me.. Just shoot the shit with your mail wo/man and make them at ease with you and I doubt any suspicion should arise.. But also I am a very approachable person and people/strangers have some strange urge to always start a conversation with me about anything...

    I ALWAYS pay the owner of the house a 100 dollars every single time a package comes, if it's 2 packages in 1 day, I give them 200...It's a big thank you, but they are taking a risk, so try that with your friends..

    I've read about civil forfeiture laws, and the application of those laws by LE scares the shit out of me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From what you know, are SR recreational users at serious risk here at losing their homes if they're using it to receive personal weight marijuana (less than a quarter oz at a time)?  Scary shit.

    I have been doing this for a while and the hardest part is getting the cash back not the mmj there.  I do anywhere from 3-5lbs at a time.  My clients NEVER use their addresses or addresses of sales locations or grows.  I tell them to find people who could use an extra $150 a wk or so use their address.  The addresses I have used in the past are primarily college kids, or apartments with high turnovers.  In order for the package to be delivered, the name on the box must match someone who lives there.  No fake names, no abandoned house or they will not deliver it.  You can, however, use an initial or spell the name wrong which I have done in the past.

Doe or Jon Dough).   The package should have a waiver of signature.  Whoever is receiving the package, should they be present, writes "Return To Sender" on it and leaves it near the front door.  NOT OUTSIDE.  then I would arrive and take it away.  Never open the package at the address it was delivered to.  It was important to me that all of my "helpers" felt absolutely comfortable.  I even told them that if something happened they should just say "So and so's friend told me he would pay me $100 to get a box delivered to my house."  they dont make enough to get in trouble for me.  Payment was per box $100 or 1/2 oz. I have pretty high success rate. hope this helps

     What you have to be careful of when receiving lots of packages, is the sorting sites. If someone at a sorting site becomes familiar with your name/address and the state in which you are receiving from is a red-flag state for marijuana, then you are asking for trouble eventually. Though, I agree that if you simply increase your volume of parcels from legal sites, amazon, newegg, ebay, etc. then mixing in some illicit packages will be much better masked.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Gaurantee if you keep receiving packs from Eureka, weekly, and nothing else? Eventually someone is going to investigate. Just sayin'

    So what's your best suggestion for those who are wanting to buy from vendors in those red flag states, on a regular basis without raising suspicion?

    Not trying to hijack or anything but this question is on topic so ill post it here.
    <br/>
    What are the chances of getting caught if it's the first time receiving at your house? I plan on buying around a qp from a very reputable person on the road.
    <br/>
    The mailman comes before 5 at my house so it's perfect for me to intercept so no one else in the house gets to it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I assume buying a qp every two weeks or month or week or w/e isn't sketchy at all, but is it sketchy if i am the one receiving it at my own house and i keep it in the house? There wouldnt be any suspicious activity going on AT the house, but the product would remain in the house it was delivered to...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also receive things from the internet on occasion and from other people. This would also be domestic. Id assume a qp could fit in a very small package as well.

    Interesting. But what i meant is use another family members name who lives in the home, who gets more packages than I do. But i am ordering something else domestically as well. But thank you for the answers. But also how would i avoid being suspicious say if i ordered a qp from the same person twice a month? Like would that be obvious? I feel like this was answered but id kinda like to see if i can get answer more specific. But thank you a lot

    Ah i missed the part of different return addresses, thats VERY relieving. Seeing cali on a package twice a month seemed super sketchy. But yeah, i plan on going through humboldtsfinest for my first qp.  Ill probably just use my own name and maybe mix it up if i feel like it or use a friends house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yeah, thanks :D hopefully this will go well, but i feel like it will considering im using a reputable dealer. Grade A packaging and a real address/name with escrow services, seems as legit as possible. Im going to get a g of deemsters first :) Thanks!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because yeah, i like to ask and ask until i get a straight up confirmation, just because of the type of situation. over 500 dollars on the internet for delivering drugs haha, want to make sure things are straight.

    Checking out norcal now. Didnt evensee any of his listings, thank you!
    <br/>
    Edit: unfortunately he does not have the prices/weight im looking for. Only one qp listing requiring FE and its more expensive than all of humbs listings :P Thanks though, ill still keep him in mind.
