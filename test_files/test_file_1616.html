    I'm getting UK-&gt;UK shipments (There is no/very little internal UK customs IIRC? Correct me if I'm wrong). Envelope came fine but it was a hand-written envelope (flag1) and he only used 1 sheet of shitty notebook paper to wrap it (it was 100 tabs) so you could tell there was something other than paper in the envelope (flag2)

    Am I just being paranoid?

    No your not being paranoid. I sell LSD. very high wuality LSD at that, And the I always always vacuum seal the tabs, for 2 reasons. 1. To keep oxygen out of them, Air ruins LSD, 2. If it were to get wet your tabs are fucked.
    <br/>
    Also, One piece of shitty notebook paper does nothing, he may as well post it without the paper, I at least use card.
    <br/>
    And I am going to start including an extra stealth method soon which will be virtually undetectable.
    <br/>
    LSD is already odorless, But safety never hurts. It is class A remember.

    Order from me if you wish, I will always make your freedom priority.1

    I really don't see the problem with hand-written address'. Lots of mail is hand written.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aslong as its not written with spray paint or something that is going to draw attention, I can't see a problem

    I would be carefull with Nbome it is fairly dangerous, and the full effects are just now coming to light, My LSD is priced comptetively and In my opinion is much better for your body.
    <br/>
    Feel free to check it out, Possibly even order one tab, Just to compare it to your Nbome, effects wise. Im sure you will see the difference . :)

    Hand written letters get sent all the time, But there are two reasons you should not do it.
    <br/>
    1. They attract more attention, As they have to be read more carefully.
    <br/>
    2. If caught people can be identified by their handwriting.
    <br/>
    3. It does not look very business like.

    Phentylamine derivatives in blotter form are probably pretty safe seeing as they're not very volatile chemically and besides they just look like paper when viewed from outside the envelope.

    In the UK, all letters are done automatically through a machine in the sorting office in Coventry (all UK mail gets processed here), It makes no difference if it is handwritten. They will only get read manually if the handwriting is too poor for the machine to pickup. The machines used are french and I think because of this they sometimes get mixed up with the letter 3. there is also another character they sometimes struggle with, but otherwise they are fairly reliable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is parcels and jiffy bags which are hand sorted in the UK, so these could pose more risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But think about it. I can post a letter at 6pm and it arrives next day.. This means the letter goes all the way to Coventry, sorted and then distributed for next day delivery - that is a big job.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is simply just not the time + resources for RM to be checking letters and packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helps :)

    This is true, But imagine they did analyze the package, or one day it bursts open and somehow they see it is drugs, All they need to do is keep a record of the handwriting etc , Now even if they did, the chances of being able to stop a package because of its writing are fairly small, But I would still not want my handwriting to be known ,because then if I ever did get caught, It is game set and match.

    evidence that a letter has been posted multiple times by the same person, Containing illicit substances.

    i figure its better to be safe than sorry.

    'Dangerous'? I'm all for harm-reduction but I've seen nothing to suggest they're dangerous. Source? Otherwise it's just mis-information. I've taken LSD for 8 years (straight from a chemist). I know it's not LSD but I probably won't buy LSD again. For 1/15th of the price the differences aren't that great. I would say it's better on many aspects

    Source? The forums here. The many many people collapsing and taking fits due to taking nbome. Now I have personally tried them, and had a fine time on them, Not a bad psychadelic either.
    <br/>
    However, For certain people they are very very dangerous. Check out Tyl3rDurden. He used to sell Nbome on here in the thousands, literally must have sold around 10,000 no less. He had all the different varities and everything. He himself recently posted saying that he could no longer sell them honestly due to the negative effects and that they had destroyed the last of their stock and moved on with their life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now if you dont believe him, I dont know who to redirect you too, He probably knows better than anybody on here due to the volume he sold.
    <br/>
    You get what you pay for. In my opinion the effects are much much different.

    Yes, everyone reacts differently. Somebody may have had a bad reaction but AFAIK there is no proof they're dangerous. Please link me if I'm wrong. 10,000 is not a significant amount. I sold that in a month when I was vending. But as I said, provide sources - and I'll take you seriously. The fact you're trying to sell me LSD also significantly hurts your case. I've had crystal straight from the chemist - I know what LSD is.

    Check the negative effects page on Wikipedia. There have been a hand-full of deaths over the (atleast) 10m tabs sold. And most of them were people being idiotic (trying to snort a drug you're supposed to take 1mg of)

    I cannot provide direct links, As I was merely stating that over the last few months I have seen plenty of people talking about their terrible experiences on Nbome, And I dont mean bad trips. Now 10,000 was an average estimated number, for all I know he could have sold more, but I know he sold thousands and thousands minimum.
    <br/>
    Also Im not trying to sell you LSD at all, I just mentioned in my first reply to you that I stock it, And in my opinion is much safer than Nbome. I also told you in my opinion it was safer and you may well enjoy it more. I was not at all trying to cooerce you into buying from me.
    <br/>
    I never said people were collapsing left right and centre either, You are taking what I am saying to extremes and the wrong way completely.
    <br/>
    For someone who sold so much product when vending, (especially a product you are talking about now) I would assume you would know the basics about shipping it, Especially that 1 sheet of notebook paper is not significant. If you really were a vendor who sold tens of thousand of tabs, 10,000 in one month. (which im not saying you werent) then you would know about safe shipping for sure.
    <br/>
    Also just by the way , LSD crystal can be shit as well as good. There is some crystal that you can hardly dilloute . The crystal used to make my tabs is either white or fluff.

    I wasn't a shipper. I was tht front end (dealt with getting the money in, getting it to the middleman and he got it shipped out from one of several locations). Then I cashed out my LR funds for LSD and sold locally. I'm aware of proper procedures - I've only ever dealt with high up vendors (rarechems, sincer, etc) whose shipping methods

    Was just curious it the 2 flags it raises were significant (which someone has answered) for uk internal customs. I will read the link later but after only 1 use I prefer it. More visuals, less mind fuck and a shorter duration.

      Hand written letters get sent all the time, But there are two reasons you should not do it.
      <br/>
      1. They attract more attention, As they have to be read more carefully.
      <br/>
      2. If caught people can be identified by their handwriting.
      <br/>
      3. It does not look very business like.

     In the UK, all letters are done automatically through a machine in the sorting office in Coventry (all UK mail gets processed here), It makes no difference if it is handwritten. They will only get read manually if the handwriting is too poor for the machine to pickup. The machines used are french and I think because of this they sometimes get mixed up with the letter 3. there is also another character they sometimes struggle with, but otherwise they are fairly reliable.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is parcels and jiffy bags which are hand sorted in the UK, so these could pose more risk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But think about it. I can post a letter at 6pm and it arrives next day.. This means the letter goes all the way to Coventry, sorted and then distributed for next day delivery - that is a big job.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There is simply just not the time + resources for RM to be checking letters and packages.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hope this helps :)

    Thanks for the response. This makes a lot of sense. I hear there are random sniffer dog tests occasionally but I don't inagine that'll be a problem as the dogs aren't trained to smell out nbomb

    Read the thread. Sounds like 90% of people are being stupid (mixing/taking too much). The other 10% were just bad reactions, I've seen similar things on 2cb,ket,MDMA, cocaine,DOM, etc. You're making it sound like mephedrone (which is garbage) when it's just another (relatively) safe RC. Think how many of these have been made. Tens of millions? Time will tell but I don't think you should be advising people against it entirely. Tread carefully.
