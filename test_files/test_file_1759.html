    What you guys think these hint.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you have order something, after that you send it to your self an anomys e-mail (like hushmail etc) You can create the adrees what ever your imagine like Nasa Fix set to spaceship..what ever.
    <br/>
    I use junkmail what i get lot of it litlle bit fixed them.  I mixet those a little bit and there says you have won a bonus coupon/ticket like (lotteyr or casino) same sender and phone numero etc....
    <br/>
    Emails say you are winner buster and tickets are nearest post office...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The adress to poste restante goes something like this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Eurocasino
    <br/>
    E-Ticket EN43435-WN
    <br/>
    POSTE RESTANTE
    <br/>
    0009000 Horstbulau
    <br/>
    Syyria
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When i Know the packet is delivery I go postoffice like mentally donkey yelling I WON WON and then  i give the email topost officer " give my packet you bitch"
    <br/>
    If something goes wrong disclaim enything. YOU ARE HERE BECOSE YOU GAVE A MAIL WHERE SAYS I WON MILLOIN!!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i HAVE DONE THAT SEVERAL TIMES AND ITS PRETTY EASY AND DO NOT awaken any suspect, and even if there a guard or police waiting deanay everething.
    <br/>
    And cause you have do the payment in bitcoins chance to get caught is zero,
    <br/>
    HIde yout laptop when go to office.

    This idea actually isn't too bad......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One thing I don't quite get though is why exactly are you going to a post office to pick it up? What address is it being sent to?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you mean like having a PO box and this email being the sole reason that you're going to check it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think it's wise to go in their shouting every time because they're gonna know it's a front by the first few times....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and I think even if you just kept the email in your pocket printed out, and say like the 10th time they bust you and they are waiting for you... and you try to pull the email excuse... they're just going to check the cameras and see you have been in there multiple times before picking up similar packages at consistent intervals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean it's certaintly possible to pull this off with safety... but you have to be very careful about your behavior.

    It's "Poste Restante", so the package stays at the post office until collected by the recipient.

    I'd be looking at bulk buys.

    <br/>
    But - I get what the dude is saying re picking up stuff from a post office. But lol all the same at the ideas we get stoned!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hide your laptop? classic! of course! We would have never have thought to not go the post office with the laptop.
    <br/>

    Man I wish I was a vendor as I'd send you a freebie just for the laugh.
