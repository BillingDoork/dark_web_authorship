    I have a problem. One day before Christmas I sent 3 letters with one fentanyl patch each. Everything in Christmas cards. They did not arrive yet and I do not know what to say to my costumers. I know because of sign for reference number that this items are in USA but waiting for shioping, What is going on? Any ideas?

    Do you mean that they have not cleared Customs yet?Â  I would tell them just that and that it can take awhile (how ever long it usually takes items to clear from the UK).

    According tracking numbers (UPSP) letters are in USA, but they are somewhere in the USA for about 4 days or so. I do not think they might be in the same place. But I don't understand why so long...? This is my first shipping to USA.

    Then they are sitting at a customs/sorting center. International mail got pretty backed up this holiday, usually packages are 9-12 days for me but I'm waiting on day 21 for one and day 16 for another (which didn't even ship out of Germany for 1 week vs usual 2 days).

    Thank both of you for talking about this. I order once a month, and placed my orders before Dec 10th. Out of 5 orders, only ONE has made it so far !! All from Germany.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm glad to know it's still Holiday jammed up, rather than think it never shipped, or was intercepted by a postal worker with sticky fingers. (and a drug habit)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OK, new week! Tomorrow is Monday. Keeping fingers crossed!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess the mail systems are still in HANGOVER mode!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace
