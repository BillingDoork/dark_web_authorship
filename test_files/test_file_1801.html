    Hey Guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just got my account funded and I'm now doing my serious shopping for my first purchase (no more window shopping) and I have a couple questions about shipping. I've been lurking the forums for a while and the buyers guide and some sources say to not  have your package delivered to your home address with your name on it. That's logical and understandable for sure to minimize any chance of LE finding out. I understand why that advice is given but do people still have stuff regularly sent to their home anyways? I'm obviously asking because that's the option I'm considering. I don't have a PO box and I don't want to have it sent to someone else for fear of endangering them and the whole point of buying from here is to make sure people don't know I'm buying in the first place. Any friend I ask to have things sent to their place is going to ask what it is and I can lie I guess but... I have no idea what the stealth is going to look like and be. I can say it's computer parts and then the stealth has, I don't know, kitchen supply website as cover, then it'll look suspicious. So is it a never ever ever ever send stuff to your home address or have people done it and gotten away with it for smaller orders?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another issue I had is that that my house doesn't have a mailbox. The mail boxes in this neighborhood are all bunched together in a big steel box down the street. I don't know who's dumbass idea that was, but I don't have access to that box. And the person I'm living with who does have access to that box is that last person I would want seeing the package in the first place. They also don't check the mail frequently so I could get my stuff a week later and that causes trouble for finalizing orders. Also they sometimes put small boxes in the mail box I've noticed. So that being said, can I contact the vendor and ask for them to ask the post office just to drop it off at the front door like a regular package if I got it shipped here? The front door rarely gets used here unless the other person living here is expecting a package. It's unlikely they'll see it if it's just left at the front door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That would be ideal for me. Just have it shipped, note when the shipments going arrive and wait for the mail to get dropped off at the front door.... BAM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So yeah I don't if I'm a dumbass for having the stuff sent here but this is going to be my first purchase and maybe my only one for a while.  What I'm planning on ordering is about seven grams of weed too, so would that make a difference? If this goes through okay and if I start ordering more frequently I'll look into other options.

    Just find a drop address man. It's hard to find but reliable once founded. Check out my guide.

    Bro i have used my own home addy 50% of the time... I get allot of legal packages and orders as well. Plus im a ebay seller,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so out of close to damn near 100 transaction almost all have been rite to my house.. And dont use fake names bro.. good way for the POSTAL WORKER to see that name does not go to the address and think its wrong..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im lucky enuff i know my mail man and the women very well soo its never a issue or eyebrow raised.. Iv had my own mailman buy items from ebay from me..lol
    <br/>

    Lots of us do it. I have smaller stuff that I'm not as worried about sent to my house, the key as was already mentioned is to use your REAL NAME or you'll just make yourself look conspicuous. Some people use the name of someone who used to live there, we all have gotten letters to a previous tenant. Use that to your advantage if you know another name. However I personally wouldn't want to use anything but my own name. AS LONG AS YOU AREN'T ORDERING INTERNATIONALLY and particularly if it's just small personal amounts, you really don't have anything to worry about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now for the crazier stuff/larger quantities, I do get that sent to a friend's house (who's cool with it) because they don't use SR at all and it would be more believable for them to say they have no idea where it came from, etc. If some shit went down at my place and they searched, I'd be kind of fucked. But I'm not even worried about it because I never order internationally and I don't have anything big sent here. Oh and I stick to the more socially accepted drugs like psychedelics, molly, etc. and have anything harder sent to my drop address.

    These are my self governed rules on receiving
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Rule one: Check the vendors stats. Lots of auto-finalize could mean lots of controlled delivery (maybe-just a theory of mine) Generally buyers will say if it came in good order and I never order from a bad stealth review vendor even if I really really want it. MBB package always on stuff dogs are trained to sniff out. I have gotten plenty of vacuum sealed stuff but the data is in on this question as researched by SR users who own a drug dog.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Rule two. NO PRIVNOTE ALWAYS USE PGP. Trust Edward Snowden on this - nuff said here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Rule three: I never use a friend to receive packages. I have heard too many stories about how a controlled delivery scares the receiver into admission and they will be an accessory to your activity. Keep all your business to yourself the there are no questions about how things went wrong if they do and nobody else to drag down with you if it goes awry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Rule four: Do not use a PO Box. I use a private mailbox/shipping company with night access for larger packages and my home for first class envelopes. Real name and ask sender to make everything look like normal mail with a plausible return addy and not overtaped. No attention drawn = no issues. If it looks odd it is not stealthy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you read the OPs in the stickys in security and shipping and use PGP (if you have an issue with PGP just wait until you fix it to order. You can get help on the forums)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some say wait a day to open a package. Research plausible deniability and know the rules.

    It doesn't matter anymore but thanks for the help guys. I was actually going to put in my first order today and finally have sweet release but of course that's not going to happen now. Fuck the government. Fuck the police. But I hope all of you guys are well and will find some peace and solace after this. Thanks for being so helpful!
