    [THREAD MOVED TO SHIPPING SECTION]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm a fairly new sr member but one of my domestic canadian orders never arrived, it was standard post. It was apparently mailed the Monday before last, and it's now Friday, so that's like 12 days or 10 business days, and considering it was mailed from Canada to Canada it's pretty much guaranteed not to arrive now correct? The seller agree'd to resend the item with tracked shipping which they did.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I for one am very nervous about ordering anything from out of Canada that would have to come threw customs. My question is as far as Canada Post Domestic Shipments, are they ever inspected on any level? Do they even do random package x-rays of packages only shipping domestically from one province to another province?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Considering terrorism these days and the fact that I'm sure some packages traveling from one province to another province must be transported by plane on some occasions, do they x-ray these packages looking for bombs or contraband? Also do you know if they sometimes use electronic sniffers or k9 drug sniffing dogs to screen packages going down a conveyor belt or something? Or are e-sniffers/dogs/X-rays absolutely never used on domestic shipments going from one Canadian province to another Canadian province? Like is the only chance of it being detected is if the package or envelope rips open by accident, or if the name/address isn't clearly readable and it's opened for inspection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also have any of you fellow Canadians ever had any drugs seized by customs that you ordered from another country? If so what happen? Did the police question you? Have any of you fellow Canadians ever had a domestic province-to-province package/envelope seized or just not show up? If so again what happened?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry for the rambling, just looking for some knowledge from fellow road travelers. Thanks guys/gals in advance to anyone that can offer any insight!

    You are likely being scammed, or were stolen from by a CP employee

    That's what I originally thought to because it's a fairly new vendor, who's name I won't mention yet, it was for around 5.0 BTC, but I never FE'd early. Also even though the original shipment was standard post, he reshipped it this time overweight to say sorry for the delay as well as with tracked shipping for free. He provided the tracking number and I can see its currently in transit. I'm still in escrow as well. Also even though he's a fairly new vendor he doesn't have one negative feedback yet. All and all he's been great with communication, and with offering a full 100% reship with free tracking plus extra weight on top, I really don't think he's a scammer. Guess I'll know with it arrives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Guess it was a cp employee or something. Also I'm sure there's got to be at least very uncommon random inspections even if it's something as simple as a dog on a conveyor belt. With terrorism I'm sure they randomly X-rays some packages that may go on domestic flights from province to province.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know, more then anything I'm concerned about my drop address being burned if it was discovered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else have any insight?
