    If you can please comment if your tracking still read it was at ISC after the 14 day mark period and if you had received  any LL ?
    <br/>
    I'm just curios to know what tracking would say if it was seized?

    Tracking will not tell you if you're shipment was seized, it just won't update and eventually the tracking number will stop working after awhile. If for some reason your shipment is seized, hopefully they'll send you a letter to notify you about it so you can at least know what happened to it. They used to send out love letters a lot but nowadays you won't always get a seizure notice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT I have had a few packages get stuck at ISC for even longer then 14 days so don't give up hope yet.

    I've seen packages form China sit in US customs for 3weeks before being sent on.  Especially around the holidays (November-January) they can just get super far behind schedule and not get to your package for awhile.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also had a friend who had a package coming from China and he called USPS after like a week-- he's an idiot-- and they said they didn't have it.  It showed up on his doorstep like 2 hours later.  The tracking takes awhile to update sometimes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless it's sitting in Chicago you're probably fine.

    All countries have different labels for delayed mail, so you have given away your country.
    <br/>
    Also given away ALL your buyer stats, an approximate value for your shipment, I'd say 100-200 amirite?
    <br/>
    Also we know that you live 100-miles (American or Canadian not EU/Aussie)
    <br/>
    So if there's any suspicious packages around the time you posted this, and they change the status so that you update this page and lead LE directly to you :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just looking out for you my man, keep the stealth higher !!
