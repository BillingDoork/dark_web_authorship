    Would anyone have any advice for stealth shipping from EU to the rest of the world (Won't bother with AUS)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there any specific way to package these small/big things?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *Cutting them up to pieces?
    <br/>
    *Type of envelope/box?
    <br/>
    *Vacuum sealing and/or packing inside Mylar/MBB?
    <br/>
    *Methods to avoid suspicious x-ray picture (would hate to have mushroom shapes on the big screen...)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you :)

    Sorry to high jack this thread but I was just going to ask the same question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just finished a batch of shrooms and I want to send some to a friend abroad can someone tell me if this packaging will work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use gloves and put the product in a zip lock baggie, change gloves and then wipe down with alcohol.
    <br/>
    Put the baggie inside a mylar bags then heat seal it with a hair straightener, change gloves and wipe down with alcohol then ship.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will that work and what alcohol should I be using, rubbing alcohol ok?

    Unfortunately a zip-lock bag won't cut it. Ideally you'd want to use something like a mylar bag or at least 2Vac sealed bag layers. After that you decide if you want to ship it as an envelope or a package, if sending via envelope you'll probably need to grind up/blend up your mushrooms so the mushrooms don't stand out.

    My fault, a friend dropped by and we talked about different packaging, should have reread the post before replying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just try to be sure that its as even surfaced as possible, this will it make it easier to package.

    Sounds like a lot of money will be spent on alcohol..
    <br/>
    Will it be necessary?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just place the stuff in a plastic bag and vacuum seal it to preserve a specific form/shape for its package. Then go to another room to put it in a MBB/Mylar without washing it.
    <br/>
    There shouldn't be any residue on the MBB/Mylar if you do this in another room away from the product. Cleaning the first layer with alcohol would also be unnecessary since MBB/Mylar wont let any smell out anyways.
    <br/>
    Washing it with alcohol on the last layer may be wise i presume.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there any recommended information about how to pack these shrooms instead?
    <br/>
    Do you lose potency when you grind them to little chucks? How about mashing whole shrooms together so they look like one big block in the x-ray screen?

    Cap them in pills and send in a supplement bottle like ginko or some other supplement that looks similar. Something you would actually send to someone that they do not have in their own country. With friend to friend shipping this works out fine. For vendors this would be a nightmare though.

    In my country, Denmark, sending and receiving any form for pills is strictly illegal. Customs will keep the package regardless of illegal substances in them or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know in some other countries, sending even prescribed drugs to a friend who recently left the country or even domestically, can lead to long term jail sentence.
