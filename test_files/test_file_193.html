    Got a priority mail envelope today with some lsd inside and I got a bit tripped out when i saw the words 'scan me' and a red sort of signature on it.. I got it but still, what could this mean? Was this on the vendors end or mine..? Perhaps it was flagged considering there was tape on the reverse where the envelope is sealed..?

    Wow, that's pretty odd.  Can't say I've ever seen that before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was flagged for inspection, you'd be nabbed by now I'm sure.  If they say it's suspicious, they basically get a warrant to open it no questions asked unless a judge gives them shit -- which I understand basically never happens.  So I don't have any idea wtf is up with that... but I don't see how it could be from flagged as suspicious.

    well isn't it possible that someone took the envelope feeling suspicious sealing inside, just like for drug smuggling. So he put the red stamp, but.. how blotters are supposed to be found via xrays? So I think operator found nothing special but paper and decided not to open. You're lucky one, if I'm right.

    I don't know, but that's really, really weird.  That would freak me right the fuck out.  Just having tape sealing it -- as long as the tape is only a single, neat strip -- shouldn't be enough for them to flag it.  If that's really all you can see, then there's gotta be something else at play.  A watched address, bad or nonexistent return address, mismatched zip codes for return address (sent from a zip code that isn't the return address zip code)... addressed to "John Doe"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't want to sit here and list all the red flags we know of or anything, but just sealing it with tape is only one and it's my understanding they just don't bother unless there's at least 2 or more.

    No, never ever ever deny!  For real, say NOTHING except to ask 1) am I under arrest, and if not, 2) am I being detained, and if not, "good day then, gentleman."  If so, 3) "I would like my lawyer present please."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They can even use denial against you.  Seriously.  I suggest watching the youtube video floating around here of the defense attorney and a policeman talking for 10 minutes about why you must NEVER say ANYTHING.  I was awfully surprised, personally -- I would have denied it too probably before I watched that vid.

    I've never heard of them doing a controlled delivery that lasted hours or days... I mean if they were going to come for you, they'd have done it by now man.  I don't know if your address is on a watched list or what, but no worries bro -- I think you're totally fine with the package you've got right there.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    If so looks like the vendor put that on there just to remind USPS to scan the DCN. And as for the red signature, I've seen packages with a red line across the DCN probably meaning that the DCN was confirmed delivered. I've also seen red stamps (dates, USPS logo) and hand written dates on some packages.
    <br/>
    Maybe thats what it is?

     No. It was written in pen.. And the red mark.. [Red marker]. Looks like a confirmation from inspector or something. It's on the front, not near the DCN. Appears to intentionally start from the return address, goes up, and a bit of scribbly circles.. a signature perhaps. I would post a picture, but that's probably not the best idea.. All in all, I still don't know what to make of this..
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What a bunch of ambiguous assholes! Scan me.. like x-ray scan me? Or perhaps.. they wrote it because the DCN was on the back and they didn't want to miss it, you know? Scan me.. why the fuck would they xray a simple priority envelope and then let it go by.. Still doesn't explain the red marking.. perhaps it was just to confirm it was "scanned" lol.. fuck this shit.. getting all paranoid over nothing probably. Someone give me some reassurance so I can rest easy..

    Just do a search on that page for "pls. scan me."  I didn't read more than a sentence or two, but I gather they sometimes do it just for the fuck of it or something.  It's all good bro.

    Just to echo what the gentleman above me said - it is all good. You'd see this a lot more back in the day when they were phasing in the delivery confirmation and tracking technology that is based off the portable individual scanners. It is a reminder placed either for a new letter carrier or for somebody earlier on in the delivery chain simply reminding them to do their job and use the scanner. I've seen it on multiple normal packages throughout the years. Typically on random Express Mail packages (as that is the only USPS product that guarantees a scan at each step of its journey) but also now and then on Priority. Nothing to worry about!
