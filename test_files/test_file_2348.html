    So I need to know the smartest way to send these seeds to my homie.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was under the assumption that drug dogs won't find marijuana seeds so please tell me if they would.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My plan was just to take each strain and put them in their own envelope inside of a larger bubble envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does this sound legit?

    Put them inside of a pen. Ship your boy a bunch of office supplies. Seeds are incredibly easy to conceal, i've gone through customs countless times with seeds on my person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *edit* alternatively,  for good stealth, put them in a bag of flaxseed, sift and sort upon arrival. In all honesty, small quantities of seed are so easy,  just putting them in a pen will work. If we're talking about how to ship 10,000 seeds.. that's' a different ball game.

    Are they even being sent through customs, or just domestically?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the latter, you probably don't even have to conceal them, frankly. Worst case? Stick them in a store-bought "seed packet" of flower-seeds.

    I started out sending seeds in pen cases, but too many got stolen. A simple piece of polystyrene is all you need, just poke the seeds into it and away you go :)
    <br/>
    If possible send them in a normal envelope, not a bubble mailer as they get more checks, especially NZ and Australia.

    Wow thanks for the feedback guys!

    <br/>
    They are just being sent domestically in the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By polystyrene do you mean styrofoam? that sounds like a good option, but I want to neatly be able to organize the different strains and pens would be easier to do that with i'd imagine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so just some pens in a regular envelope? like a letter envelope?

    I would suggest a bubble-mailer so that you don't have to worry about anything getting broken in the postal machines.

    Stop. Re-read that part. Think for a moment the potential ramifications. If you still don't understand, start over at the beginning of this post.

    He's actually trying to point out that using a return address that can be traced back to you while shipping illegal items is a very bad idea.

    When I get seeds off from big name breeder, they usually come in zip lock bags stapled to business cards. The baggies are then put inside a DVD cases, wallets, or they'll be wrapped up inside a folded up T-Shirt. Sometimes they'll even double up and use DVD case and a t-shirt. I've gotten over a dozen packages from the UK to the US and never had a problem.
