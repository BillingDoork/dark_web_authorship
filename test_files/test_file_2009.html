    I'm Canadian and I'm thinking of ordering 5 MDMA pills from a Canadian seller. Exactly how much risk am I taking with this ? What if someone finds them ? Realistically what's the worst that could happen to me ? Would I just get a love letter or what ? I'm guessing the police really couldn't be bothered too much. Though I read that MDMA has recently been made a schedule 1 drug in Canada. Also I'm living at a university residence where mail comes to the school and then arrives at my place a day later after they sort it, I'm worried about someone at my school finding something and then being in trouble with the school. Would others be willing to take this risk? Mind you obviously anyone could mail me something without my knowledge/permission. Do you think I should get a PO Box and use that instead ?

    Statistically, you have a 96% chance of getting busted.  Of those, 45% go to jail for 1-3 years, 28% get 4-3, 17% get 5-8, and 6% get life.

    Is the package going to be vacuum sealed.  Is your vendor stealthy?  I get shit shipped from overseas to the US with no problem.  Do some research on your vendor and see if they are reputable and stealthy before you go taking on risks.  Also, research the risk that is involved in your area man.  Peace.

    Consider that people get ounces of weed successfully from across the globe, going through customs and then some.  With a high success rate, in fact.  A good vendor that can get weed through customs is a damned good vendor.  That said, domestic is always the safest bet, unless your seller sucks at packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's always a risk no matter what you order, which highly depends on your vendor's packaging skill, and you not to raise awareness to what you're doing.  MDMA i'd be very mindful of where you're ordering it from since it's more likely to be sniffed out by a dog, and the less hops it has to make the less risk you're taking.  And some countries have much more strict customs that will be more thorough in checking what's coming through (like NL).

    If you can't suck up the risk yourself, and understand and mitigate rather than try and throw it out of your mind— don't do it. Don't trust other people for important decisions in your life. Trust yourself.

    Assuming this guy is legit, this shows MDMA alerted dogs pretty well even through vacuum sealing. Faster then weed even.

    According to pine's statistics and others, you've got about a 97% chance of success if you choose a good vendor.  There are no such things as guarantees, don't use a vendor that gives you bad vibes. Maintain a clean house while expecting shipments, don't have multiple incoming orders. There is always going to be risk though, but you can manage it pretty well.

    Thanks for the replies and advice everyone. I have been reading the forum and trying to glean as much as I can about shipping to Canada and MDMA but I thought I would just ask people what they thought directly. I was primarily looking out for thoughts/ideas (like should I use a PO Box instead ?). I messaged back Marijuanaismymuse to ask whether it's vacuum sealed. I haven't heard back from him yet so I'll see. what he says. I had heard about MDMA being picked up even more easily than weed by a dog (even though weed is more pungent to humans). I'm also trying to find out the purity of the Red Armani Exchange tablets/if they have caffeine/amphetamines in them as well.
