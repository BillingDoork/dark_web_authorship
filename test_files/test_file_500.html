    so on the 16th i ordered one once of blue dream from rook and 4 lolipops from angelina via 3-5 day shipping. by the 17th on the next day both were in transit. i've order from both before in late november and both took 3 days shipping time. the lolipops came from WA in 3 days as usual but the blue dream (from cali) has yet to come. it is now the 27th and 8 possible days have gone by. rook is a very trusted vendor here and i'm fairly certain he wouldn't scam me. i come here to ask if anyone else is experiencing this kind of delay or has recently from rook or another vendor. it worries me because i don't have $300 to lose.

    Yea, it's christmas mate, expect it. Had a package be a week late and then be addressed as Undeliverable as Addressed because the mailman probably didn't give a shit about looking a tad harder for my apartment and alas, there goes my 300USD.
