    If you're worried about the vacuum function suctioning some of the powder up the vacuum, don't really. Then just make sure there's enough extra space on the bag to feed an end into the heat sealer. You could also use an impulse sealer without drawing a vacuum on the first bag with loose powder in it, unless you want to flatten the product or make it more compact with the vacuum seal. One thing though, as a customer that sometimes buys powders; If there is no warning about the last opaque layer not containing another baggie, and you cut into or rip it open and the powder spills all over the place, that is a little annoying.

    You won't be able to Vacuum Mylar and other Types of Moisture Barrier Bags with Normal Vacuum Equipment, to do that you need a more expensive Type called "Chamber Vacuum Sealers". This is due to the fact Plastic used for Vacuuming has ridges in it designed so it's easy to draw the air out of the bags, while Mylar does not have this. Now if your only intent is to use the Vacuum to Seal the Bags and nothing else this works fine. For a Demonstration on a technical work around ( although probably not not viable for large amounts of order ) see the following Time Linked YouTube-video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1cbQK3Nj4&amp;t=3m32s
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't want to use any Vacuum Equipment for Sealing you will need some kind of Heat to Seal the Bags, see for example my thread Heat Sealing Equipment: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160856
    <br/>
    Also if you haven't done so already I suggest you take a look in the thread STEALTH THAT WORKS - DITCH THE PE FOOD GRADE VAC SEAL: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458
