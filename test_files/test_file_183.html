    They don't really care about the fact that you're buying few grams of weed every now and then. They won't bother you as long as you don't make them problems.

    I wouldn't worry about it...?  I rarely use an address more than once because generally I'm buying stuff for friends too so for example if we were going in on like a 1/2oz of weed we'll each get a 4th and in return for me hooking that friend up he would let me ship it to his house.  That being said, I wouldn't be too worried as long as you don't get a love letter.  After one love letter than that name and address should be done.

    Use addresses like normal people. Dont open them, receive 2 packages then never return to them. That looks awful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Play the part. I have had customers ( and myself included ) have used the same drops for years. Portray yourself as a business or whatever and just act cool. No one is recording incoming mail and unless something is found, no one cares what your mail is about.
