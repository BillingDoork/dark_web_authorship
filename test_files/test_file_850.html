    It's my understanding that they are still delivering packages on Saturday, but not letters &amp; junk mail, though I could be wrong...

    You are wrong. Letter mail stops in August. Packages will continue even after that. Only letter mail is discontinued.

    I've been preparing mentally for the Saturday transition now that I'm using SR full time for my weed supply. Its good to hear that packages will still be delivered. I was under the impression there was 'no mail on saturday after august'

    Yeah, not that their website is the best in the world, but the USPS site seems to indicate that only Priority and Express will have free Saturday delivery, which seems to imply that you could add Saturday delivery to first class for a fee.
