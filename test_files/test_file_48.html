    I'm considering shipping few NBOMe tabs internationally, so it will go through customs. I was thinking to do it in a normal envelope with a birthday card inside. I will make it look like a random, normal letter, I will ensure I don't leave any fingerprints what so ever and the return address will be one of the previous tenants.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From the research I've done and the orders I received so far it seems that NBOMe tabs are secure enough to be send through customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do I need to worry about vacuum sealing? I did not keep the tabs close to any other drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm shipping them to a friend, just to see if people like it as they never tried this stuff....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you in advance.

    I wouldn't really worry about vac'ing tabs up. It could be blotter art, it could be potentially a lot of things, but you can never be too careful. As long as it is in a tightly sealed baggie flat against the inside of the card, I doubt anyone is going to touch it. Also, depending on where you will be sending the tabs, NBOMes are uncontrolled in many countries. I've received plenty of tabs just sealed in a baggie and folded and or taped up within paper, cards, and all sorts of things with zero issues. Just my two cents, but everything you have described seems good but the return address in the previous tenants name which can be alright in certain situations, but its really up to you on how discreet you want to be.

    if you are worried about an rc that they cant detect by smell etc this isnt the place for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you going to be laying the blotteres yourself or reselling someone who is already on here? i ask because there have been deaths linked to 25i

    Yeah you don't really have to worry about it - as for vac seal there's no human detectable smell, and there's no way dogs are trained to sniff it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But maybe a fun clever thing that also is good stealth/paranoia would be to do your birthday card thing and wrap the drugs in a dollar bill or whatever small denomination paper currency of which you may avail yourself. No birthday card is complete without money (at least from a relative), and this way you get at least one extra paper layer. All the nbome dealers I've used on sr have gone with some variation on a paper within paper within paper approach.

    No need to be cocky mate, it was a simple question. My apologies, I don't ship drugs everyday.

    I'm going to resell tyl3r's tabs, they have been tested personally and from the feedback of hundreds of his customers nobody seemed to have had a problem. So I'm not concerned about killing people + if you're stupid you can overdose on aspirin, I will not take blame for peoples stupidity.
