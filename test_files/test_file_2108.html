    hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I received a letter from the police for a convoncation ... the subject is not mentioned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it must be for a letter with illicit substance, I have 2 letters that never happened in my personnal SR history ... So it is possible that the police have one of these letters with my name and address on and the product in it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What attitude do I have to deal with inspectors? What should I say? What do they save? What i haven't to say ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I play the fool who receives a letter from a person and a country I don't  know?  why the sender would know my name, address, and why would he send me a letter? ... What kind of question the police might ask? what should I answer ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I open a new account silk road? the police know silk road?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'm from EU
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you for your help ...

    You're saying they send a letter about having a conversation? It's been said before, and will again be said. Silence is golden.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't even say "I didn't order it", pretend you're a mute. Nothing you can say will help your case as much as saying nothing.
    <br/>

    UK may be a totally different ballgame though.

    If they do not have a warrant, they do not have enough evidence to get one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Say that your attorney forbid you to speak, and that he will do the talking for you.
    <br/>
    If you did something wrong, they will arrest you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still keep your mouth shut, and let your attorney speak for you.
    <br/>
    Besides don't you have way much more important things to do?
    <br/>
    Like reading that book that is laying on your shelf for years now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DO NOT SPEAK!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even in court, do not take the stand and speak.
    <br/>
    Always let your your counselor do the talking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing you do have to answer is ; who you are.
    <br/>
    The info on your driver license is enough.
    <br/>
    So keep your mouth shut and show them a official ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They are no friends of mine.
    <br/>
    Never helped me and have got nothing but trouble from them.
    <br/>
    I can do without them!

    burn the letter and don't talk to police. Lay low for a while never ship to that address again, I also recommend cleaning your house of drugs.

    If they had anything they would be busting into you house.

    This is really good advice. ^^
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the past I've used the "i don't have to say anything" line. While its accurate,  the punkassness of that statement is usually a good way to perk a cops interest.  Saying that "my attorney forbids me to speak with officers, you'll need to contact him" in a polite, professional and cool manner seems that it would show a whole different level of respect, maturity, and at-least partial knowledge of the law.

    Laws are different in every country. Consult a lawyer if possible. If you can't afford one, try to get some free legal counsel from a family friend. Here in the U.S., you can call different criminal lawyers and most will give you a free consult the first time...

    If you can not afford a lawyer, one will be appointed to you.
    <br/>
    Se the good advice from the professor;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You see, every lawyer will say the same.
    <br/>
    You say that you want to talk but are not allowed to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are arrested, you will be getting a lawyer.
    <br/>
    Until you have seen him, you simply do not speak.
    <br/>
    You do not ask for coffee or cigarettes.
    <br/>
    You keep simply your BIG mouth shut, even when you know what you are saying.
    <br/>
    Trust me, you don't know what you are saying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Promise yourself not to speak for at least four days.
    <br/>
    For the Netherlands I know you will be released after 102 hours.
    <br/>
    Or you have seen a judge who added a few days to your arrest.
    <br/>
    Meanwhile you have seen a lawyer.
    <br/>
    Make sure he is indeed a lawyer.
    <br/>
    A counselor does not have to be a lawyer.
    <br/>
    As a civilian you do have to give your name, date of birth and place of birth.
    <br/>
    NOTHING else!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now watch the youtube again!
    <br/>
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc
    <br/>
    and again!
