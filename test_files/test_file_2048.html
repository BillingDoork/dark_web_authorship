    Do vendors split up larger orders when mailing stuff out? More specifically I'm wanting to get a 1/2oz or ozof MDMA, would a seller be open to splitting it up in 2 or 3 packages. Would much rather get a love letter for 5gs than a knock on the door for an oz.

    Oh, I was under the impression swarming was a common technique. So when people speak of these love letters it's refers mostly to MJ and the likes? Please excuse my ignorance.... new here and just trying to soak up as much knowledge as possible.

    You probably won't get a love letter either way
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but if you want to cut the possible loss of 14g all in one go, you can ask the vendor to send in multiple shipments. that way if 1 gets found, you don't lose out on a shit load of money.

    14g is absolutely nothing. Ive received upwards of 50g to my address. I've also heard of people receiving packages containing 100g of mandy. Really just depends on how stealthy the vendors methods are. But half an O of anything should be fine. Even through customs. Just as long as you're ordering from a decent vendor.

    And I highly doubt they would waste the resources to do a CD for a measly 14g....But you never know. Doubt it though.
