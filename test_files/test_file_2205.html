    Californiabuddy,
    <br/>
    Dont worry the times are altered! even the dates! so now worries! i mean i could still remove. My thing is. That this is just the start of it it has been accepted and the next day all at the same place it says sorted! so i mean what? they scanned it in 4 different times on accident? it just kind of worried me! i mean come on  why would it accidently be scanned in the same sorting center 4 times in 1 day?
    <br/>
    let me know what you think
    <br/>
    and any of you out there? vets to noobies! let me know and i really appreciate it!!
    <br/>
    thank you all in advance! hope to hear more input soon!

    happens alot over the weekend sometimes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    friday processed
    <br/>
    saturday processed
    <br/>
    sunday processed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    then leaves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i assume they are just shifting the bins around and your item scans in the bin it was in.

    ive been doing this a long time.

    you wanna know what i have learnt about tracking numbers ? dont look at them. they only fuck ya up in the head lol. they dont always look alike, they dont update like they should, they have new messages youve never seen before ... all just a giant headache.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i only ever used them for my own protection against claims.
