    Judging from other threads on here, getting stuff into Ireland seems to be a bit...er, hit and miss, to say the least. Since there's currently only one domestic Irish vendor listed on SR, it looks like buying from someone internationally is unavoidable in a lot of cases.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm wondering if people have had much success getting LSD in particular into the country? There are some vendors listed from the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, but what are the chances of it actually arriving?

    Hey
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One of my friends lives in Ireland and he's gotten acid sent to him a number of times. It's hard to imagine acid getting caught by customs. If you are looking for a seller within Ireland check out this guy. He's offering free samples at the moment too

    Just buy your tabs domestic from Lensip. He is still setting up his account but im sure he will be taking orders soon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your really that worried about customs you could just get a few tabs of 25I NBOMe, Customs won't be looking for that.
