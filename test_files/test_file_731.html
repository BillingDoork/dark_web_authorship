    Is it okay to do or safe. As long as the email is not traced back to you? I mean i think it would save alot of checking tracking. Since for 6 days mine says origin post preparing shipment. after it supposed to have departed foreign customs but has not yet said it arrived In us customs&gt;
    <br/>
    any advice please? about the email updates and the situation greatly appreciated!!Thanks in advance

    <br/>
    2 important questions about track trace .com
    <br/>
    1. Does it have the same up to date tracking as usps
    <br/>
    2 can you track it using tor?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thank you all in advance!
