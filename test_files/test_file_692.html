    I know that when the tracking says "Processed Through Sort Facility: ISC SAN FRANCISCO (USPS)"  that just means the package is still in customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question is:  What is the average time that a package stays in customs?  Mine has been there for 4 days now.  Does anyone some experience to share?

    well i never order intl from sr i have ordered seeds online before and when they get to chicago or new york it usually only took a few days after that for it to arrive in my mail. sometimes they are a little slow at updating the tracking. just be careful though, i dont know what you ordered but i would clean my house if i had something coming thru customs from sr

    thanks for the replies. Hopefully the tracking is just slow to update.

    I once had a package stuck at the NY ISC for 10 full days. I was beginning to worry and then on day 11 it showed that it had departed to my local sort facility and I had it on day 12. The packaging was completely non-stealth which leads me to believe the next paragraph.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just out of curiosity, what country is it coming from? I understand if you don't want to answer but for example there is very little US customs checking for packages coming from other English speaking countries, including India. If it's coming from the Netherlands, you can expect it to be checked pretty thoroughly. Also, there is almost no customs checking on letter mail unless it is obvious it contains objects. I have gotten letter mail from the EU in 4 days before because they were packaged well.

    it's coming in a box from Canada. Thanks for sharing your experience.  Any other stories are more than welcome.  I'm not worried yet, but I assumed that Canada would be a pretty low-profile country for Customs and my package wouldn't get held in customs for so long.

    I wouldn't sweat it, I used to order illegal electronics from china that would sit in customs 10+ days. Every time I was sure they would confiscate the package, then it would show as in transit and all would be good.

    Don't worry about it. I have tracking numbers from overseas that never get updated beyond "origin is preparing for shipment" and they get delivered every time.

    well, I've also ordered a lot overseas and they've always tracked just fine for me. I guess I gotta just hope its one of those times where the tracking gets screwed up.
