    So, my question is, how long do you guys wait in between placing orders? Or do you have multiple orders being shipped out at once? Are there greater security risks with having multiple orders being shipped out at once? Sorry if this has been posted before.

    It's just like anything else. The more often you do something, statistically, the more likely you are to get noticed. That said, as long as the vendors you're purchasing from take care in their packaging, you'll probably be Ok. There are other factors to consider, too. Where are the vendors you are ordering from located?  If you have a bunch of packages coming from 'high risk' countries than of course your level of risk is inherently higher.

    Hey Jay92 ..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    .. I seem to recognize you from anther thread ...  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also will only order domestic product because chances of detection are reduced dramatically. So I would think the rule of ordering a lot of stuff to one address could also dramatically decrease odds of detection in your favor if you only order domestic.

    That's my 2 BtC.

    I placed a lot of orders to begin with, but my mailman seems to be different every day, and I receive a lot of packages sometimes, anyways. Everything I have gotten so far has been very stealthy- if I didn't expect it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A guy I met from another site sent me 10 units of 1.5 mg DOC on candies and gums, in a plain envelope. I'm really surprised it made it... I guess I'm glad I live in a population dense zip code with a small post office staff, for the amount of work- it seems. And the different mailman every other day helps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm only sweating the orders from overseas. One is scheduled (DMT). One is not (4-AcO-DMT), but I'm fairly confident they are alright.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm now trying to just cut it for awhile... but that ear-wax looks awfully tempting.
