    Can't give out too much info, but I'm in the US, and heavy weight is on it's way and authorities have been tipped off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do I go about making sure everything goes smoothly? Any help is much appreciated, I've already cleaned my house.  :'(

    if the package comes mark return to sender immediatly.  the first thing you say is "i want my lawyer" and then you don't answer another question until you're lawyer shows up ( no matter how nice the cop is and no matter how badly he wants to help you  ::) )  that's probably the best advice i can give friend.  godspeed.

    If they come and try to get you to accept package...refuse refuse refuse.  If they leave it on the porch...write return to sender and don't touch it.  Have your house clean as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or just leave town for a couple weeks.  ???

    You should completely wipe your computer clean (I have no idea how to do that, you will  need a computer guru).  I am not reaslly sure it is even possible, Computer forensics experts always seem one step ahead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would personally smash it up in a field, and try to melt the hard drive, do anything I could to completely destroy and break it into a million pieces.  The I would throw away the pieces in like 16 different places, maybe more.  That is not my advice to you, just a thought.

    have close info on a CD in my area over the summer. here is how it went down:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DEA was in place on the street observing
    <br/>
    Mail was delivered by the regular mail carrier, not a sub
    <br/>
    AS SOON AS HE ACCEPTED DELIVERY and closed the door they rushed the house.
    <br/>
    He didn't have time to write anything on the package
    <br/>
    he was immediately placed in cuffs and isolated while they searched the property
    <br/>
    he had scales and gram packs weighed up on the premises
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This was for some decent weight coming from overseas. According the the press release, DEA was tipped off by customs.
    <br/>
    This person was good friends with/worked with someone I know very well who also lives on the same street, so I got info that wasn't in the news.
    <br/>
    Based on the above scenario, I would refuse the package. "I have no idea who that is, I don't want it." PERIOD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW the bustee disappeared into the ether, he never showed up in the court system and hasn't been seen or heard from since.

    this post is so stupid
    <br/>
    the whole point of a controlled delivery is to get you to accept it, thinking everything went great and your care package contains goodies
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since you apparently know there is a controlled delivery coming, you are three steps ahead of the poor sucker who doesn't
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The solution is simple: don't accept anything onto your premises. How you want to do that is up to you: take a holiday, refuse everything, install a webcam at your door so your lawyer can combat any lies, contact the cops and say that you've reason to believe you're being setup and you want that recorded in their daily blotter. Some combination of these things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what's the problem exactly?
