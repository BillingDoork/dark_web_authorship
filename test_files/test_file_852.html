    After several successful orders on the road, I finally had one not come thru.   Wasn't a big order, was for some edible,  but it never showed up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a few other orders between that have came thru like usual with no issues.   However,  I went in for some edible mushies,  and they never arrived.     ( seller did not use tracking )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So being a stand up guy he reshipped with tracking a couple days ago, and he and I assumed it would make it for delivery today.  (Saturday)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mail comes and goes today and I get nothing,  message him, he provides me with the DCN,  says it was at my post this morning before the sun came up, and says delivered shortly after 1 pm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My mail never runs before 1 pm.  Even on Saturday,  it is more like 2 or 3.           So what to do what to do?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well I google  * usps says delivered but was not *   and the general opinion is that something is scanned delivered when the carrier actually takes it and puts it in your box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now there is a chance it will be delivered on Monday,  have to wait and see,  but I was curious,  has anyone else tracked a package that shows delivered status, that came the next day or such?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I don't get is,  wouldn't there be a record of which postman carrier scanned the package?   I am considering going to the Post office and saying what the hell home frys?  What is going on with my mail.      However reading others with the same problem, they seem clueless and I haven't seen where they actually can tell who scanned it last.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?    * On a side note,  the original edible gummies are supposed to be in route first class mail again and should arrive this coming week, unless something fishy is going on *
