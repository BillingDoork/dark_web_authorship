    So I am about to start sending out "business packages" and I obtained a large amount of label 400 tracking stickers, and I went to the post office and got priority mail stickers and envelopes, but I only purchased 5 of them, and I was wondering if it would raise suspicion if I bought 10 or 20 at a time, and maybe rotated post offices? What is the best way to go about this while trying to remain anonymous and avoid suspicion?

    Well he might be saying that because you are on camera in the post office buying the the stickers..
    <br/>
    However even if they intercepted your package and found whatever drug or item you might be sending i highly doubt they would check the post office cameras to see who bought the stickers. Unless you are sending kilo's or are sending packages of drugs worth more than 50 thousand dollars you probably have nothing to worry about.
    <br/>
    But, its always better to be safe than sorry and it never hurts to be too careful.

    Well that's the thing... I did not obtain these stickers from a post office, so If I continue to buy enveloped and stamps, say 10 or 20 at a time per post office, should I be fine?

     you bought them online, which is the only place u can get them. that means they have a mailing address that is connected to you in some way. they might also have your financial details and ip if you used your internet or cc.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     also if 1 package gets caught its trivial for them to watch the range that are assigned to that roll/order.

    Buying envelopes at the post office won't raise flags, they sell them for a reason, but if you're going to be shipping out a lot of stuff, buy bulk from a shipping supplier, not the post office... or use the free flat-rate boxes. I can go to my post office a couple of times a week on differnet times during the day and get about 500 flat rate small boxes a week, for free. Just grab all of them in the cubby and walk out, totally legal and allowed. As far as stamps, I say buy as many as you want. They sell them for a reason. In any case, they would never try to bust you by asking the post office who buys the most stamps(face palm).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to use your own envelopes, buy from a shipping supplier, or go to staples and get the padded packs of 10 for like $7. Slap on a priority sticker(which are free at the post office, you dont even go to the counter for them), an address label, and your stamps, and you're good to go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would also suggest you check out my thread in this shipping forum about printing your own tracking labels up. We're not sure if it works yet but the theory is sound and if it does work then every vendor will be able to have tracking without any connection to the tracking labels.

    Envelopes and stamps are no risk really, Normal stores, Post offices, ebay and supermarkets sell them in packages of 100 and more. There is no risk with buying a couple of hundred at a time, It is actually pretty common.
    <br/>
    Stamps buy them say 100 or 200 at a time and rotate. If you think thats too risky go for smaller amounts.

    Sorry I cant help with the tracking mate. Missnatural, Do you have a link to that thread?

    Ive spend over $100 at a time on stamps at post offices between  1 and $20 stamps, and of course pay in cash, there is nothing to be worried about, its not like there is tracking on the stamps themselves. It would be virtually impossible for LE to try to get video evidence of people buying a lot of stamps, im sure most would be using them for legal shipping anyways.

    They sell the priority stamps in sheets of 10, I've bought 10 sheets before.  Its not odd at all.  Stamps arnt tracked they have no markings on them.  It would be impossible to corrolate what 400 tracking label numbers you got at the desk when you bought your stamps, and pin them to a intercepted package days or a week later by video footage alone.  Worry more about being on camera when you drop your package off.

    Buying hundreds of dollars worth of $5+ stamps regularly can get you noticed. It may depend on the size of the town you are in. Many post offices don't even carry the big stamps and those that do may not have a lot of them out in the retail sales area. If you buy all they have a couple times, they may start to remember you. It is not illegal, but, I think it is best not to be noticed at a post office you might mail a larger package from. I say travel to a nearby town or... to buy large amounts of stamps or if you want a lot of Priority mailing boxes.
    <br/>
    BTW, I think the Boxes in the lobby are usually flat-rate boxes.
    <br/>
    If you use medium or larger size USPS boxes for light weight items, it can be a lot cheaper to NOT use Flat-rate postage. Order online if you can anonymously or ask at the counter for Priority boxes that are NOT flat rate boxes. They appear to still be free for Priority mailing. I think $7 is enough postage for any Priority package that weighs under a Pound.

    @NW Nugz is absolutely correct re: large stamp purchases and their availability at every single PO (some are too small to feel the need to stock them).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A few more words...: If you're in a large town/city, there is no need to increase your risk and ship packages from POs that you've stepped foot in before.  Assuming your paks are under 13oz, take advantage of the blue boxes and never step foot in a PO to mail packages.  If you must make PO drops, never overlap your stamp buying POs with your drop POs!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the extra paranoid, I would suggest buying a random # of sheets at 'faraway' POs so that your purchases never begin to create a trail that follows a pattern.  This is, of course, assuming you (we) are (all) one man operations.  Good luck all
