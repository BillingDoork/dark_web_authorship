    Hi Guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    can anyone shed some light on "delayed for clearance" means?
    <br/>
    does it mean that it has gone through customs and awaiting delivery or that they have caught the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any other information would be great
    <br/>
    thanks :)

    I would assume it's waiting for clearance through customs, you can also google different postal tracking statuses and codes for more information. If a package is intercepted/customs catches it, it would not show it on the tracking/DCN...the tracking would just not update.

    Thanks for your reply, I have google what it may mean and have had a lot of different answers including
    <br/>
    1: that its awaiting customs to clear it
    <br/>
    2: its been intercepted
    <br/>
    3: its been cleared and waiting for delivery due to increased mail this time of year
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also has anyone had this on their tracking and still received their package?

    Depends on what country your are in and how many days it's been sat there, sometimes tracking doesn't even update and the status showing varies from country to country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have read of US customs showing a status for ages then the shipment just arrives, in countries like AU if it doesn't move for a day or two it generally means it's been seized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is also a lot of conflicting advise re checking tracking with Tor, some reckon that's a red flag but to be honest I haven't read any conclusive info to confirm or deny that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope it works out ok!

    thanks for the help, its been there 48 hrs might be too early to start stressing  :o but dont want to say where i am and yea have heard about tracking through tor so def haven't done that,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hoping they haven't updated  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    however if it had been seized would it say that it has reached my country yet? i had some pharmaceuticals on the way and they only showed that it had left the country and not that it had arrived here, soon after i received a love letter, so in this case it could be a good sign....
