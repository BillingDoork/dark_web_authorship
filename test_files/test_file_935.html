    Okay. So I placed an order late wed night via express.  It was shipped early Thursday, and should have been received by noon today.  However, it hasn't yet showed up.  Now, I live in a major metro area and in one of the guaranteed "next day by noon" express areas.  Every other express order I've placed (about 10 now) have all come by noon the day after shipping.  So now, I'm freaking out.  I sent an email to the vendor (who's highly rated, and who I've received two express orders from previously, both in 24 hours or less from when it was shipped).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my question is should I be worried?  What are the chances that the express package may show up with my other mail sometime in the next hour or so (when its normally delivered)? Do express orders sometimes get delivered with the regular mail?  Because I was of under the impression that they were delivered separately by someone who delivers express mail only.  Is this not correct?  I sent a message to the vendor who said he'd track the package and let me know where its at, but I have yet to hear back with the tracking info.  As I said, I'm freaking out a bit, so any bit of assurance will certainly help my situation (though the only thing that will alleviate my anxiety completely is of course receiving my package).

    Calm down. A package being a few hours late is not something to worry about. The postal service loses packages all the time, so I wouldn't be at all worried. I would suggest making sure your house/apartment is completely clean if you are worried, but otherwise its not a big deal and not worth stressing over.

    Cool, thanks for replying so quickly brotha.

    Yeah, I left work early with the hoping of doing some dope and now I'm totally disappointing and fairly worried.  I hate missing work if I have no reason to.  Fortunately, I can work remotely which lessens the blow a bit.  Once I started reading the identifiers the postal service uses to profile suspicious packages I started to really worry.  Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted if it does show up.

    Shit bro, that sucks.  That makes me think USPS is catching on and is confiscating packages.  Vendors are going to have to step up their game with regards to their shipping standards.  If they just make everything look like a business sending something (and use a real business with a real address as the return address) the likelihood of a package getting nicked by a postal inspector is next to nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And yep, mail came, and its not there.  I think it was likely snagged by the postal inspectors.  Unless of course it didn't go out, in which case I'll be extremely unhappy (I'll be far more unhappy if it got snagged by postal inspectors, as that will mean my address is burned and I won't be able to get anything here anymore).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm still waiting for the vendor to get back to get back to me with the tracking info, but I'm thinking it got confiscated.  Fortunately the package is in the name of a former resident (all of my packages were) so they can't really do anything as long as I don't accept and sign for a package (which I'd never do).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, I think this may be the first order that got confiscated for me.  Now I may have to use a different address.  Shitty thing is, I really don't have another address I can use at all.  The other shitty thing is, that was the last of my disposable income I had available, so I can't go IRL to get anything for this weekend.  I was really relying on getting this, this weekend.  Now my weekend is going to suck.  FML

    I was thinking about that but I really doubt it, on my end anyway.  this vendor has had all his other orders be successful and his stealth is pretty good.  At the same time though, how could i be THIS fucking unfortunate.  If nothing comes tomorrow, I think its a sign I should just quit dope altogether.  Yeah, thats what gonna happen, then like some random fucking time next week the packages will show and i'll be like, fuck that i doing some dope.

    It ended up showing up about 6pm.  Only reason I didn't post right away was because I did a shot and was nodding out in my chair at my desk in my office for the past few hours.  I actually woke myself up by falling out of my chair sideways, knocking over the floor lamp  next to my desk &amp; smacking my head on the wall.  I'm perfectly alright...just a little annoyed is all.  Shit! I also fe

    Only bad thing is, I took some phenibut earlier and it made me very dizzy after I took a shot...I've also been extremely nauseated as well.  I actually puked everything up out of my stomach and continued to dry heave repeatedly after doing the shot. I've been extremely nauseated since I did the shot a few hours ago.  I thought that phenibut would potentiated the dope greatly, but instead it just potentiated the bad parts of it more.  Oh well, what are you gonna do?
