    well since we're in the shipping part of the forum I'll stick to questions regarding that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am in a university campus in the US and I can't have stuff mailed directly to me. There is a package receiving center for the whole campus where one goes and gets his packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I was thinking if I wanted that to be my SR shipment receiving address I would have to knowingly go there and ask for a package which would completely rule out the "I don't know what this is I never asked for this package" excuse in case I got caught. So should I rent a P.O. box? or try to check at ups to see if they rent private boxes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I won't be receiving weed at least not for a long time now. Right now I'll probably be getting lsd so I also wanted to ask you guys: is it as easy to detect for dogs or maybe other detection methods?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm pretty sure it doesn't reek like weed does. I've never done it before but hoping for 1 or more experiences on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what can you suggest/comment on this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: should I ask for usps or a courier?

    I'll let someone else chime in on this as I'm no expert but here's my 2 cents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can't see any problem with this as long as you put all your legitimate info. The plausible deniability defense only gets you so far and you have to take extra precautions such as writing return to sender on it if you bring it in or just leaving it in the box for a couple days. Plus when you go to pick it up, you could always say 'Oh this wasn't the package I was expecting etc etc...'. But I think you won't have to worry about that too much. I would also not go with either UPS or FedEx.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as I know LSD is pretty much NEAR odorless but it is possible for LE to intercept these packages if they are watching the vendor and/or the area they ship out of.

    Get some magazine subscriptions.
    <br/>
    Order some shit of Ebay...cool shit that will make the LSD that much better. May I suggest a trippy Dead throw blanket to put on the wall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go to the receiving center and ask if you have any mail?
    <br/>
    Sometimes its magazines, sometimes t-shirts, sometimes throw blankets. Othertimes a half sheet of Lucy.
    <br/>
    Do it bro, its odorless and don't rush. Make sure its from 3Jane, Albion, VitaCat or a domestic re-seller of their product. It is the best.

    i got a deadmau5 blacklight poster haha
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so you guys are saying I shouldn't get the P.O. box.. I should get some subscriptions to stuff that will get mailed to me towards the package center so I go and check for my mail instead of my package of lsd. and also I should never ever sign anything right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also yeah i've read around and I'm currently waiting for 3jane to get some stuff
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: also I'm not sure if all P.O boxes work this way since i'm actually international..just got to the us a week ago or so.. but at the post office here you can just go in and get your stuff without having to talk to anyone or anything..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also usps doesn't mail to this package center

    Yup, right to your mail center.
    <br/>
    Hidden in plain sight.
    <br/>
    No P.O. box bullshit.
    <br/>
    Only sign if the vendor says you have to sign which may be the case if you go overseas.
    <br/>
    It is going to blend it with all the mail. You have no worries.
    <br/>
    Try to find a domestic for your first go around.
    <br/>
    Shit, I'll browse the listings for you and give you a recommendation if there is a legit vendor at the moment.
    <br/>
    You could place your order today and get this ball rolling.
    <br/>
    Its safe to have healthy paranoia but if you go to the right vendor you have nothing to worry about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Happy travels.

    I find it difficult to believe your university does not allow USPS to deliver mail to its receiving center.
    <br/>
    If I were a mother looking to send a care package to my child at school I would choose USPS.
    <br/>
    However, if that is truly the case, P.O. boxes do not require you to show your ID or talk to anyone when you go pick up your mail.
    <br/>
    It is just like your mailbox.
    <br/>
    However, you will have to show ID to open a P.O. box.
    <br/>
    But like I said, you have nothing to hide. You are getting paper in an envelope so just use your real information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem with P.O. Boxes is that there are a large number of vendors who are weary of mailing to P.O. boxes as they tend to be more scrutinized then residences.
    <br/>
    If you do have to go the route of a P.O. box, make sure to get a big box so you never have to go to the counter if the package does not fit.
    <br/>
    Get the biggest box they have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any more questions, just let me know.

    it is retarded indeed but it is true i've experienced trouble with it already. I asked for a package (legal stuff) and it got sent via ups to the post office and from the post office it got returned to the sender so I don't want that to happen to any vendors or to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will try to get the biggest box they have and still I will only be buying small quantities. If lsd i'll try to keep it under 5 or 10 papers

    Exactly, if you are buying a ten strip it will always fit in the small box.
    <br/>
    But lets be honest with ourselves. Once you have a successful transaction you are going to be purchasing more.
    <br/>
    For instance the 10g of herb. Again, this could easily fit in a flat priority box that would fit in the small box.
    <br/>
    However, some vendors will use the USPS box that is not flat or perhaps their own packaging.
    <br/>
    I have received a gram of molly in a box. It was not suspicious and the packaging was superb.
    <br/>
    I say this only because the gram obviously could have fit in an envelope. For whatever reason, this vendor decided to send the package out in a box much larger than required.
    <br/>
    Just extra stress if the box don't fit and you have to ask the lady at the counter.
    <br/>
    Hence, get the big box.
    <br/>
    Order your ten strip.
    <br/>
    Feel the magic.
    <br/>
    And continue your journey on the Road.

    First of all. I would advice against shipping to your university. Here is a rundown of how my university gets you your mail/packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mail goes into a little mailbox you have a key to (quite safe I would think)
    <br/>
    ---------------
    <br/>
    Packages on the other hand!
    <br/>
    They go to a campus sorting facility where they email you a code that you need to pick up the package
    <br/>
    upon picking it up you must SIGN AND DATE saying you picked up the package.
    <br/>
    I have ordered a few packages (non-contraband) and they appeared to have been opened and smashed back together with half a roll of tape. I don't doubt that the university can and will go thru your packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is just my experience and your university may be different, but I wouldn't even consider receiving a package here.

    3Jane just said she could have listings up in a week but definitely in September.
    <br/>
    Also, a vendor named No FE Ever has some 5 strips up. A review is coming in on Friday to give us an idea of the quality.
    <br/>
    If the review is good you may want to pull the trigger.

    damn that sucks
    <br/>
    <br/>
    at my university that's not how packages are handled. It's a big open room where anyone can see how the courier employee grabs the packages and takes them to this room puts them on the floor and there a bunch of student assistants organize the packages in alphabetical order.. although you still have to sign in order to retrieve it from them. hence the best option is the P.O. box

      First of all. I would advice against shipping to your university. Here is a rundown of how my university gets you your mail/packages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Mail goes into a little mailbox you have a key to (quite safe I would think)
      <br/>
      ---------------
      <br/>
      Packages on the other hand!
      <br/>
      They go to a campus sorting facility where they email you a code that you need to pick up the package
      <br/>
      upon picking it up you must SIGN AND DATE saying you picked up the package.
      <br/>
      I have ordered a few packages (non-contraband) and they appeared to have been opened and smashed back together with half a roll of tape. I don't doubt that the university can and will go thru your packages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This is just my experience and your university may be different, but I wouldn't even consider receiving a package here.

     damn that sucks
     <br/>
     <br/>
     at my university that's not how packages are handled. It's a big open room where anyone can see how the courier employee grabs the packages and takes them to this room puts them on the floor and there a bunch of student assistants organize the packages in alphabetical order.. although you still have to sign in order to retrieve it from them. hence the best option is the P.O. box

    If USPS don't deliver to the sorting center than your only option is a P.O. Box.
    <br/>
    Unless you know someone who lives off campus.
    <br/>
    Every vendor uses USPS. Get the big P.O. Box, get some Ebay shit and Mag subscriptions and you're set.
    <br/>
    Start googling for P.O. boxes in your town.
    <br/>
    Unless, like I said, you know someone in a crib off campus. Then use his address.
