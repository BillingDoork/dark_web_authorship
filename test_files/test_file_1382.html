    Does USPS keep shipping records? If I was to call them and provide proof of residency, would they give me a list of all shipments to my address? I tried it for UPS and they gave me all the info, but USPS's phone lines are always busy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My wife who lives with me caught me opening a package of molly. Now she thinks there's more to this than just one package. The packs I always get always are USPS Priority Mail, with no tracking but there is a DCN. Would USPS keep a record of this? Would they delete this upon request?

    They do keep a short record but wouldn't provide it to anyone other than Law Enforcement with a warrant from a judge.

    So UPS is free to release such records, but USPS isn't?
    <br/>
    Even if you provide proof of residency?

    Essentially yes. I was reading an article about this earlier. It's because one is a government institution with special laws, whereas the other is a private company.
