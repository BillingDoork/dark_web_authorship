    I ordered a tenstrip that was shipped out 12/20. I still haven't received it and have been getting all kinds of other mail as usual-- packages from Amazon even that have been shipped out much later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know USPS is jammed up this time of year, but I'm starting to get really concerned. Has anyone waited this long? 7+ business day shipping time for domestic first class within the US?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Needless to say, I'm cleaning house today.

    Not waiting seven days but was expected a package from my same state on Thursday that is still not here. Plus our mailman has been running hours late all week - I think we have a substitute mail guy.  Good luck.  Hope your package arrives soon.

    I'm one business day behind expected arrival on a package. I think it's standard.

    I had a similar experience with a purchase. Shipped on the 20th and for ten days nothing. Not sure what the fuck up was (I'm thinking either weather or sorting error, since the DCN shows it going in a big fucking circle all week), but it arrived today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.
