    Hello. This is my first post.
    <br/>
    If this is not the right place to ask, please direct me to the right forum.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone have experience with shipping from China to the EU?
    <br/>
    I have no idea how tight the security checks between China and EU are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The substance in question is Pentobarbital Sodium.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (Bonus question: What would be the consequences of let's say, getting caught with 25g of Pentobarbital? Home invasion (raid) or just a subpoena? I was not able to find even one newspaper or police report about small-scale Barbiturate imports. It's a Schedule III substance in my country. 25g might be looked upon as trafficking.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    I've bought so many ridiculously illegal things from China before and had them shipped to the UK with no issue at all. The only thing I'd say is that you may need to wait a few extra days (3 max) whilst it goes through customs as the EU is obsesses with Chinese import quota's and they're more worried about you trying to exceed their quota's importing Made in China toys than they are about you importing illegal substances.

    To be honest I hate Western Union but every vendor in China seems to love it and use it. I find the Chinese quite honorable and usually they wont scam you, honor is a big deal to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Western Union is easy to use, but obviously there are risks so make sure the person you're dealing with has some kind of good reputation.

    Ok great. Thanks for your swift help. I don't worry a lot about being scammed in this case. The contact has proven themselves trustworthy according to a reliable source.
    <br/>
    It's kind of puzzling how China is so lax with certain substances. They don't seem to mind slinging kilo-bags of whatever chemicals at you.

    Oh, the source is not on Silk Road. They're selling all sorts of research chemicals. This one just happens to be illegal in the EU.
    <br/>
    If it works out, I'm considering sharing some on the SR but that's something to ponder when it's time*.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * potential problem: Pentobarbital can also be used for euthanasia. Supplying it to a sick, dying woman got an individual in the UK convicted for assisting suicide. They got a few years in jail for being compassionate. Legally it's much worse than dealing recreational drugs.

    You're right. Even in the worst case, should one get caught selling it, it's out of one's control what the buyer does with it.

    I'm still looking for good ways to import illicit substances from China to Europe, on the order of a pound or two.
    <br/>
    My connection in China is flexible but they need to maintain a clean vest. As far as they're concerned, it's all for research purposes.
    <br/>
    Basically I need to find a trustworthy person in China with stealth shipping experience... like some contact in a major harbor.
    <br/>
    He would pick up the merchandise at the lab and take care of the transport. I'd pay 10-20% commission for reliable work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be honest it sounds impossible for someone who doesn't even speak Mandarin.
    <br/>
    Should I just give up?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's a significant demand for it in Europe.
    <br/>
    There's a significant supply in China.
    <br/>
    Crossing the border is difficult.
