    I'm pretty sure you can just buy stamps with cash at the post office.Â  Why is it more complicated than that?

    Ill share some postal knowledge. All won through experience.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    #1) You can not send a letter with a DCN, They will require registered mail with a signature. DCN's are for first class packages
    <br/>
    <br/>
    #2) You can send with stamps, but, they dont like it because too many people can not read a fucking scale and put it into the usps online postage calculator. Thus they get the amount wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    #3) Asking about mailing with a DCN at the PO will get different answers depending on who you ask. Out of 25 post offices, 6 told me I had to bring it in and pay for postage before the DCN would be active, 4 said I could stamp it but had to bring it in to be scanned, and 15 said as long as there was correct postage it would be scanned no matter where I dropped it off at. So it depends on the post office you go to, the area you drop it off at, and how big the line at the post office is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    #4) Go to the post office and buy stamps. They work on all packages!
