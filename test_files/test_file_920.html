    Yet buyer claims did not receive. Both tracking #s show delivered in his city and the address was correctly copied from what was given. (First two times sent via USPS Priority mail without any sig confirmation)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What to make of all this?? Never had an issue like this happen once.

    Right but strange thing is, he's willing to pay to have the product overnighted for a 3RD time with Sig confirmation this time. A guilty party would never do that would they? I dontknow, never dealt with an issue like this before.

    Honestly, something doesn't smell right if that's the case.  Almost like they are looking for something that haven't found yet.  I would stop doing business with that person for sure.  I understand if you want to go for the $ but that sounds suspect.

    Then again, I am a paranoid guy.
