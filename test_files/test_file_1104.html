    Hi there SR community,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a question for you. One of my clients asked me to send 100 GBL to Australia . I only sent Fentanyl patches to Australia, nothing else. 100 ml comes in 3 separate bottles 34 ml each, every bottle has a separate label that the liquid inside is a printer head cleaner and the instruction how to use it. Is my stealth enough for Australia? I know that Australian's custom forces are crazy, and very well trained...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers.

    It's down to luck and how authentic your labels and instructions are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The whole "bench and tile cleaner" type scenario was played out about 10 years ago over here when customs went crazy over people importing 500ml to 1L of pure GBL from China.   They are familiar with the various ways of trying to pass it off as an industrial product.

    Yep, Ive seen on television some kind of sniffer that sniffs particles at molecular level. In use at the border control of a airport.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am sure they are in use all over the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aussies seems to screen every envelope or postcard that's is coming in from abroad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The sniffer sniffs on each and every card or envelope let alone the parcels and packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A 100% screening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only the best of the best in stealth using gloves etc will pass.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some kind of spectrograph reveals everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even empty bags are screened with a few wipes in the suitcase and let the sniffer tell what has been there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Scary device I would say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive seen a sniffer in action on money-bills.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And remembered that only new bills pass,
    <br/>
    and the majority of the old bills not,
    <br/>
    they have been contaminated with drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Money-bills can contaminate other bills.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or even by second or third hand touch.
    <br/>
    People shake hands all the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There have to be very little molecular structure to proof they are there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a thought a suggestion from me
    <br/>
    Perhaps it is a trick to try to fool the machine.
    <br/>
    Submit a note of 10 dollar in the envelope with the drugs included.
    <br/>
    When they see money they know the sniffing-device would give a positive.
    <br/>
    When the money is discovered it will be most likely seen as a false positive.
    <br/>
    Money gives always a positive or in the neighborhood of 90% of all cases.
    <br/>
    Make a note with happy birthday and congratulated with your fifth birthday, signed grand daddy and grand ma.
    <br/>
    They would destroy a birthday present of a five year old, now would they?
    <br/>
    I didn't try it, maybe they are monsters at border-control. I know of rewards for those who find drugs.
    <br/>
    Just to keep personal motivated.
    <br/>
    Subsidized by the DEA if it is a poor country that can afford to pay rewards for confiscated contraband.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Authority's keep a eye on our drug use by measuring our waste-water.
    <br/>
    By collecting all urine from a city they know how many gram has been used, of THC coke heroin LSD everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And they don't use a bright light anymore to see what is inside a envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They can look trough your suitcase and your own body if they want to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    More often then not, they do want to screen you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are 100% screenings for everyone, no exceptions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For example everyone from south America.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Innovations in screening devices continues.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are a lot of sea and airports so the market is big.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Smart machines.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am sure they make software to screen for known extra features when looked inside a envelope and letter, related to drugs in the past.
    <br/>
    That ain't that difficult anymore these days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aussies have the advantage that everything has to come trough ports, sea or air.
    <br/>
    They don't have long borders which are impossible to control.
    <br/>
    That gives them the occasion or opportunity to get these high rates of success.

    Good stealth and small quantities will beat any customs around the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    GBH is one of the easiest drugs to ship,you should be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in Australia and out of 9 overseas orders 8 have made it through and the one that didnt i reckon it was never shipped.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stealth+small quantities+fast shipping=win for ozie buyers.

    Well done Koonta, better success rate than me, but do agree, small quantities combined with good stealth is the key. Still refining my methods.

    GBH?  You're not an Australian reporter are you?  ;)  I'm sure it was just a moment of dyslexia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whilst I agree that the chances of success are good, it will be luck/weight of numbers or convincing labelling rather than stealth that will get it through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can't hide 100mls of liquid from AQIS or Customs if they inspect the package.  There are not many liquids that AQIS/Customs aren't interested in. Prescription medication/alcohol/explosives/precursors/chemicals in general etc.

    More sellers wont ship to the US then anywhere else, aussie customs can be good but they aren't as tough as the US or russia or finland, out of almost 100 international orders, around 20-25 didn't show up.
    <br/>
    Ive ordered it once, not on here though, it was opened for inspection, but because it had that plastic coating that you tear off on the lid, it went through, if its able to be opened up, i don't think it would get through.
