     You can have a little or as much mail as you like thats up to you. I guess its more depending on where its coming from and the size of the packages etc

    I'm sure your mail carrier delivers to hundreds of addresses every day...they're probably more concerned with getting their work done, and waiting for the workday to be over then figuring out why one person is getting more mail than usual.  Wouldn't worry unless the packaging is so bad that you can smell something or something else that makes it blatantly obvious that there's something illegal in the package.
