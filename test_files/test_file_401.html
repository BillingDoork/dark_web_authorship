    Hey there,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered MDPV from CrystalMethCat (shipped on 24th of Nov from Germany) and also some from BOSS (Shipped with express tracking from Italy to Aus on the 5th).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still have not seen any of those and was wondering if anyone was encountering the same problems? Any previous package I have received took no longer than 16 to 17 working days..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could it be related to holiday season?

    Shipping is FASTER this time of year!  Due to the increased traffic, to make sure there's no delays with the vast majority of us having relos in the UK, there's LESS obstruction getting things through.  Fuck, I got a card from my aunty on Monday and it was post marked SEVEN DAYS EARLIER.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The last thing we need is ANOTHER piece of bullshit giving the dodgy dealers yet another excuse to rip Aussies off and feed us with the same bullshit.

    the only time customs seized one of my orders, they sent a letter to me know they'd be happy to give me my sleeve of smokes for a modest price of 200bucks.

    There's no doubt deliveries are taking longer than usual, but we are in the middle of the Christmas period where I heard today Aust. Post will receive an EXTRA 3 million letters/parcels and have employed an extra 2000 temporary staff to cope with the influx.  :)

    The NL is one country I avoid altogether. I'm sure some packages get through, however it's known world wide as a drug "hotspot" and mail/parcels from the NL do get scrutinized a lot more by Customs than some other countries due to this fact. It is Xmas so the post is slower than usual so don't give up just yet.  :)

    Also i saw this message on his wall today, this is another customer who seems to had trouble with him...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's the message on wall :
    <br/>
    -------------------
    <br/>
    Be carefull!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did the mistake and Finalize Early. The Order never arrived and since 2 weeks CrystalMethCat didn't answer my PN/mails.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    $83 for nothing! For now he seems to be a SCAMMER!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i still hope CrystalMethCat answers to my mails and we find a solution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did good deals on SR with nice communication. I know, its possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ------------------------
    <br/>

    I asked 3rd times for Tracking number but he doesnt answer my messages

    I was hoping that this whole "slow Christmas mail" thing was causing the delay in getting my order from MarijuanaIsMyMuse.  My order info says it was shipped to aus on 29 Nov... still has not arrived but two other packages ordered the same week (from different locations) got here within two weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My fourth Christmas order from CrystalMethCat EU was shipped on 18 Dec and arrived yesterday, so only 2 days and that's with Christmas in the middle!  Thanks CMC, I appreciate the speedy service at this busy time of the year  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These are my first four orders on SR so I don't have much of a benchmark, but it seems around two weeks is a pretty normal expectation to get to aus from most o/s places... which prob means my order from MIMM has definitely gone astray and I won't be getting it.  Bloody shame cause out of all four orders the gear from MIMM was  what I was most keen on trying.

    I have also order off (MarijuanaIsMyMuse(97) -MIMM) &gt;14days and have not received anything. I have received another package from a Canadian vendor today which was ordered the day after my MIMM order 15/12/12.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get the feeling i wont be seeing the MIMM package (and like secure i was really forward to tasting MIMM wares)  and would be interested to hear if any of our fellow Oz SR travelers have successfully done business with MIMM? I have never made a negative comment about a vendor, for two reasons -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. (touch wood) i have been blessed with the vendors i have meet so far, MIMM  unfortunately currently not included, and all packages have arrived within recommended range or before.
    <br/>
    2. The other reason is basic courtesy and respect for the great and very much appreciated work all vendors i have interacted with have delivered. It will be very disappointing if both Secure and I dont receive our MIMM packages as it may suggest we may have been scammed and wont be receiving anything?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be great if anyone can offer any advise so i have some faith that this product may still arrive?

    good call.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    bit off topic,
    <br/>
    a friend of mine just popped in for a visit and was telling me that he heard all packages that weigh over half oz in total have a sniffer dog go through them(as they travel down the conveyor belt, lighter packages travel down a separate conveyor belt) whereas lighter packages only occasionally get scanned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    not sure if its true but worth a though

    Hi - This is a throw away account so take it or leave it, your choice... I have chosen not to actively participate in the forums till now as you all do such a fine job of keeping us informed - thank you. I like the idea of a small target.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been a member for 18 months and had nearly 40 successful OS and local transactions.  I ordered with MIMM (first time) at end of November and package still hasn't arrived. Received other orders from UK (Ivory &amp; Lloyds) and IRL packages from US within 14 days during this period.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also have an IRL friend that uses the road that is in the same boat but with a bigger MIMM order than me and is also still waiting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did not FE - good move and never do  but reading through MIMM terms and conditions, she only offers a 10% refund after 6 weeks so regardless of whether it was intercepted or selective scamming, I'm taking a hit to both pocket and buyer stats to get this resolved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now left wondering if it's worth the hit to my stats for 10% of a G to go through resolution. Might be better to finalize and leave negative feedback instead. Regardless I will wait till the 6 weeks is up and perhaps a minor miracle will happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you folks reckon?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1 out of 40 ain't bad but I'm avoiding Canada from now on. It is on the "HOT" list anyways??

    I had an order from MiMM go missing in October. It was only 0.25 and I FE'd at his request. He refunded me 25% and I left shitty feedback. The problem with him is his FE policy is that it effectively hides all his bad feedback by loading up the front page with "FE will update" permanently.

    Just updating that package from MIMM arrived today, I havent had a chance to sample but wanted to update and let everyone know that although it took a little longer then expected, it was well worth the wait and the slight delay was obviously caused by Aus Post being a little overwhelmed with X-mas mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also wanted to add that MIMM's packaging was simple but  brilliant and very unlikely to cause any suspicion with anyone. I would defintely recommend MIMM to any other Aus SR travellers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will come back tomorrow and update re: quality, however judging purely by look, smell it is A+ gear  :D
    <br/>
    Happy Tweaking!

    I have placed five orders since late November, only one did not arrive.. it was 0.5 from MIMM.  The two orders I placed at the same time as MIMM's arrived in 12 and 15 days respectively, the two placed after MIMM's arrived in 10 and 12 days respectively.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I used the same name and same address for all. five orders from different vendors.. I obviously have to question what happened to my order from MIMM.   At first I thought it may have been intercepted but then spoke to a friend who also had an order in with MIMM and theirs did not arrive either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Feedback on MIMM's page over the past few days looks like a lot of people have received their orders this week, but go back a few pages (to approx lat week of Dec) and there are many buyers who have FE and never updated... and many others stating that package did not arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, in my recent experience I don't think delivery times have been excessive for standard mail into Aus over the December period, but I do think maybe 'something' went wrong for MIMM for orders he received around the beginning of December?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wonder if it’s possible that as MIMM has become so popular, a lot of his orders are being intercepted at point of dispatch... maybe they don't ever get out of his country?  Either way, I’m glad I only ordered 0.5 as a 'test' from this vendor.  It is very difficult as a new customer to get any reputable vendor to do business unless you FE and that leaves us wide open to lose $$.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While MIMM was straight up in offering a 25% refund, it does seem like a significant number of his packages are not making it to their destination lately... which means we all lose!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All that said, this is not a 'normal' environment we are operating in and shit will happen.  I remain grateful for the opportunity to shop for my drugs in a civilized and relatively reliable way and I sincerely thank all the vendors I have done business with... and all those I am about to do business with!!   ;D

       Feedback on MIMM's page over the past few days looks like a lot of people have received their orders this week, but go back a few pages (to approx lat week of Dec) and there are many buyers who have FE and never updated... and many others stating that package did not arrive.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So, in my recent experience I don't think delivery times have been excessive for standard mail into Aus over the December period, but I do think maybe 'something' went wrong for MIMM for orders he received around the beginning of December?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I wonder if it’s possible that as MIMM has become so popular, a lot of his orders are being intercepted at point of dispatch... maybe they don't ever get out of his country?  Either way, I’m glad I only ordered 0.5 as a 'test' from this vendor.  It is very difficult as a new customer to get any reputable vendor to do business unless you FE and that leaves us wide open to lose $$.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       While MIMM was straight up in offering a 25% refund, it does seem like a significant number of his packages are not making it to their destination lately... which means we all lose!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All that said, this is not a 'normal' environment we are operating in and shit will happen.  I remain grateful for the opportunity to shop for my drugs in a civilized and relatively reliable way and I sincerely thank all the vendors I have done business with... and all those I am about to do business with!!   ;D

     No package, Only 25% refund = 25% feedback score...HONESTLY...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Had 100% success with mimm for quite a few orders at first many moons ago when i first joined sr...
     <br/>
     All of a sudden bam... my first ever non arrival, ok no problem so i tried again a week or two later... Different addy to the first used.
     <br/>
     BAM! would you believe it? Another non arrival, 2 in a row diff addys... part refund offered...
     <br/>
     The second addy that i had a no show to i am still using to this day, still coming in.
     <br/>
     I have not used mimm ever since...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am not suggesting anything here just giving my experience about a vendor so others can make better decisions....

    Now that December is over I can confirm it- there were only the shortest of delays.  Very, very few parcels were more than 3 days later than normal.  At least 3/4 of what I shipped down under got there in the normal time frame.  My feedback percentage actually went UP over the holidays and now I am at 100% positive.  Am I tooting my own horn?  You better motherfucking believe it.  But I am also singing the praises of the elves that help me since they do 98% of the heavy lifting!

    Ivory Order-Posted 6th December. Now 21st Jan. Never arrived.
    <br/>
    Dont order from Ivory, offers no refund and you have to FE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I made another O/S order nearly 20 days ago and still no show, but should hopefully arrive this week, fingers crossed!

    my order from mimm sent on the same day hasn't arrived either, i have to wait 6 weeks for refund.
    <br/>
    not sure if mimm expects it to come or is just making me wait but six weeks to hold $1000 is a long time.
    <br/>
    now i have to wait for my 50% refund before i can get more.
    <br/>

    the worst thing is ill prob go back to him to get my coke cause i like it.

    If you are expecting a 50% refund I am assuming it was sent express with tracking?
