    Hey I have a bit of a dilemma on my hands, could I get some advice please from our esteemed SR community.
    <br/>
    I have 2 orders that are overdue by 10-14 days. Just small amounts of Rx. One purchase is the resolve phase, I’m not concerned about the BTC’s just really concerned that my mail-drop has been compromised.  In the interim I had etizolam send me a decoy pkg and the decoy made through no problem but the 2 pkgs of pharma have yet to make it.
    <br/>
    Lately I had some weird things going on with my mailbox which is in a CBU, cluster mailbox unit. About a month ago my mailbox was locked on the day I was expecting a pkg but eventually, 2 days later the mailbox was unlocked and the expected pkg was there. A week later I made another SR purchase and that arrived fine no problems. A week ago the mailman never delivered my mail, in those three days I was expecting a pkg. He would just pick up the outgoing mail but not deliver any mail. Then I had the decoy sent which made it, but that is the last pkg I have yet to receive.
    <br/>
    I have not yet received a 'love letter' nor have I experienced a controlled delivery. Any thoughts?
