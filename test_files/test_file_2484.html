    Interested in picking up an address label printer (ones that print on media with adhesive backing), does anyone have any recommendations? Preferably as cheap as possible and proven reliable. Preferably standalone (where you punch in the data on the device), but will entertain computer-based ones as well.

    cheapest way is through using those label sheets @ staples. 3000 laserjet printable labels cost 12$ after tax. However, i think you're talking about professional label printers probably.

    Not sure if you read my post or not, but I am asking for personal recommendations for a economical/reliable labeler (i.e. specific products or models), not what printers are 'untraceable'. I never listed that as a requirement.

    I've been thinking about buying one as well, but sure if it's really worth it or not.

    The topic I posted, while titled for untraceable printers, covers some good information regardless. Dymo brand. The 450 or the 450 dual are both great choices. If you're not doing illegal things and/or worried about being traced, you can get the dual one on Amazon for 129.99. Otherwise, they're 199.99. The 450 single is 99.99 retail or like 80 bucks or something on Amazon.

    BROTHER QL-500, cheap as chips, interchangeableÂ  label sizes, the software is excellent. Really, really pleased with it. Paid $35 brand new with a 30day money back guarantee. And to think I was going to buy the $100 one, luckily they were sold out.
