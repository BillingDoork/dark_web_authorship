       USPS seems to be the favorite for most vendors. UPS and FedEx are said unsafe, for reasons unknown to me.

      Don't quote me on this, but from what I understand, USPS needs a warrant to open your mail; FedEx and UPS do not. Hence why everyone uses USPS.

     Just to confirm this..
     <br/>
     USPS is govt service mail delivery and they need a warrant or reasonable cause to inspect or open your letter / package... such as if your box is leaking battery acid its going to get opened. This is in accordance of the 4th amendment of the United States Constitution, protecting privacy and which guards against unreasonable searches and seizures of personal property.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     UPS and FedEx -- these are private companies and they reserve the right to inspect any package at any time.. (read the fine print when using these carriers)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both UPS and FedEx have central "sorting" facilities in the mid western states -- when shipping any package from the east coast to the west coast, there's a 98% chance that package will go through those "sorting" facilities.. and how they work is, every 3rd package that comes down the conveyer belt is taken off and put into an area call "to be scanned" which means they are x-rayed, and inspected (without trying to physically open the package)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     word to the wise... dont send using UPS or FedEx.

    The USPS warrant to open mail only applies to mail sent first class. I worked for UPS for a year and never once heard of any sort of X-ray machine being used to scan packages, sounds like an urban legend to me and if they do use X-ray machines, do you honestly think the post office wouldn't be as well?

    Trolling?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I feel usps is a better choice. I have had more packages opened for inspection with fedex. If i remember correctly there was five signatures that were on the inspection sticker that was attached to the side of the package. I've had more things damaged through ups than fedex. The one reason i belive usps is a better choice, is they are loosing funding, (sadly) and they have a huge quanity of mail. Junk mail and bills finally serving a purpose. :D

    Ok, so you back your point with making a broad genralization about all the employees. Do you have anything to add other than one of the companies, other than you getting your feelings hurt? I stated the negative experiences that i had with fedex and ups. I don't feel that fedex, ups, or their workers are bad. I understand that sometimes when things are getting shipped that sometimes shit happens.

    This isn't entirely accurate. It's not inaccurate, either. Express and Priority also count as first class mail, that's all my correction is.

    Incorrect. As they are considered First Class mail, USPS absolutely does require a warrant. One fellow around the forums has posted info straight from the USPS FAQs about just that, that's why I know. :)
