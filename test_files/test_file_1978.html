    I ordered from an overseas vendor and received a tracking number. I've been following it daily and today I see it's been "delivered"... only to the wrong place. To a city 3 hours away in a completely different state.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been doing some reading and know that sometimes packages get marked as "delivered" online if they have arrived at a PO after the office's trucks had gone out for delivery. I can only speculate that it was routed to the wrong PO and it's a temporary marking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I called up USPS to inquire more and they mentioned the only way to begin an investigation or delivery dispute is for the sending party to initiate it. Being abroad and an SR vendor, I don't see this happening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm pretty livid that the USPS would fuck up this epically on a huge several hundred dollar order. Hopefully I can work something with the vendor out, but due to the nature of the package and transaction, I feel that it's equally likely to be a lost cause.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone experienced anything like this before and still received their package?

    I find your story unlikely, if you contacted USPS about the package it would imply about as much guilt as signing for it and you would likely still be charged and arrested. Usually when a package is sent to the wrong address it means one of two things, the vendor scammed you and wants to lower the chances that you will complain about it, or they accidentally screwed up who they gave tracking to or sent a package to.

    This would be true if he called from his own phone because there would be a record of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If he used a payphone or someone else's cellphone or his works phone or some sort of proxy then an internet phone call, he could bypass evidence and they would have nothing on him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    More then likely though he used his own phone so I agree. They would arrest you if it was, indeed, such a large order. At least around here. They arrest you for anything over an oz, if it isn't an oz then the cop will just fuck with you or arrest you so you have to pay the fine.

    Yeah, I have to agree at least partly with kmfkewm that this "failed CD attempt" story sounds a bit fishy in a couple respects.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The way any piece of mail gets recorded as "delivered" into their database is by the carrier scanning the bar code on the package with a portable scanner which all carriers carry.  If the carrier scans it as "delivered" he obviously thinks he is delivering to the correct address. If a delivery is made incorrectly there is no way for the system to know what that incorrect address was.  The incorrect receiver of that mail would have to return that package to the PO or back to the carrier before it could be put back into the postal delivery system.  Mis-delivered mail that is returned to the PO is put back into the system for redelivery.  There is no accounting for the address the piece was mistakenly delivered to even if it were Express mail which receives the highest handling priority.  It just doesn't make sense that the PO gave you  the address to which it was wrongly sent.  So the obvious question is how were you able to look up the address the pkg was first (allegedly) delivered to?

    I didn't think USPS tracking revealed the full address of the receiver--just the city and state. Did this happen with USPS or another carrier?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was your package as displaced, geographically, as mine was?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I called, the postal employee was not helpful at all and actually said that he has access to the same information I do and that's that and once it's "delivered" it's out of their hands.

    Ok, thanks for the clarification. I'm feeling a bit more relieved that it isn't part of a potential bust knowing the conditional deviance between our two situations.

    LOL!  USPS tracking DOES NOT supply addresses of delivered mail so I still don't buy your story as it makes ZERO sense...but lets talk about who's a moron.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone who has weed sent to them via  USPS Express mail..is a MORON
    <br/>
    Anyone who gives LE agents permission to enter their residence without a warrant...is a MORON
    <br/>
    Anyone who answers LE questions without an attorney present..is a MORON.
    <br/>
    Anyone who gives LE permission to "look around" their residence...is a MORON(and an idiot)

    Damn dondada that's scary stuff. I wonder why they put a fake address on the tracking site instead of just leaving it blank, that doesn't seem too smart of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think you would have signed for it had you not noticed the non-existent address? It makes me shudder just thinking about someone coming that close to getting busted with weight...

    If your story is true then maybe its the vendors poor packaging. Yes it might be tripple vacuum sealed. But did he wash his hands after handling with the raw product? Is his house a smoke free environment? All of these things add up to add permanent scents onto the plastic. Also when a vacuum sealer is working it melts the plastic obviously and other scents can get stuck within the melted plastic. Forming a permanent smell for dogs and electronic sniffers to make your package revealed. Vendors need to think about this. Washing your hands is a must when handling the raw product!!!
