    I'm kinda worried about ordering pills...I mean, I'm pretty sure you can hear them when you shake the package - or even feel it!
    <br/>
    And what about the scanners? I have ordered 2 times from this seller, it was powder though, but the packaging was excellent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But again, I don't feel too comfortable about ordering pills ^^

    Simple...don't order something if you're not comfortable with it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stick to powder deliveries and your mind will beÂ  at ease ;)

    order from CB and pay for his best shipping twice or more depending on how many you order, he'll sort you out ;)

    if the vendor is smart, you won't know what's in the package until you open it...

    Any vendor selling pills on here that wants to be successful should know how to pack them so they don't rattle or cause bulges in the packaging, otherwise their deliveries will be seized and they're putting the buyer at risk too, Ideally they'll protect them from being crushed as well. If they can't manage that, they'll be issuing a lot of refunds, losing money and getting poor feedback. Other potential buyers will see that and avoid buying from them and eventually they'll pack it in as it's simply not worth it. Vendors aren't here to ship free drugs and loose money.
    <br/>
    It really isn't that hard to do, you just have to get creative, use your imagination and stay within the standard shipping guidelines (ie standard business delivery, nothing that jumps out). If they can't do that, simply order from a couple of the successful vendors that ship to your country and see how they pack them.
    <br/>
    If you're a buyer and your're concerned about a vendors technique, read through their feedback, either on the SR main site or they're review thread on the forums. Be on the lookout for buyer comments about packaging, but don't expect to get specific details. If buyers are impressed with the packaging, they'll typically mention something along the lines of fantastic packaging, super stealth or that they opened the package and couldn't find them at first.
