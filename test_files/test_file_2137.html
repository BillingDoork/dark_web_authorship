    hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i bought half an ounce of hash from italy, and apparently its been sitting at customs for over a month.
    <br/>
    ive come to terms with the fact that im never getting that package, but i was wondering if i could use the same adress for another smaller order of coke (1gram) from a different vendor from a different country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    tracking on post canada says its has arrived in mississauga and will be reviewed by customs (its weird that its in ontario since its farther)
    <br/>
    id like to know what to expect (letter from customs, a fine, being deported to australia)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any input would be greatly appreciated and sorry for not being super coherent structure wise

    Hey Abbas,
    <br/>
    1. Tambourine man is NOT a scammer. Check out Tomorrow-man's page - he recommends the guy, and TM himself has an excellent reputation.
    <br/>
    2. Your address is burned and flagged. They will deliver your stuff, but they will keep track of what you are receiving and will watch for any slip-up to bust you and identify your suppliers.
    <br/>
    3. If you don't like TM for whatever reason, check out Larry Bird or Northern Dancer - all good upstanding people.
    <br/>
    Good luck,
    <br/>
    LiS

    I've had an envelope from Thailand sit over two weeks in customs (Vancouver).   It was finally released and sent to the east coast.  That was long time ago.
    <br/>
    I think that customs was very busy at the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it Express or something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure if your address will be flagged, because it's a lot of envelopes/packages for Canada Post to keep checking because of one address and a small amount of dope.   I don't believe Canada Post or RCMP have enough resources to assign staff to keep checking one single address.  They have bigger fish to catch, you're not that important...   :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think domestic mail is safe though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ask a friend in Europe or any other country to send you like 1gr of sea salt or sugar in a nicely sealed business envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    See what happens...........

    yeah mito, you are most definitely right, i doubt the rcmp has enough resources to keep me under surveillance, i guess i just needed somebody else to rationalize that for me. i think im gonna order from northern dancer, just cause i like horses, and if it still doesnt work, ill go with the homeless guy po box route ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyways, thanks again, you guys are super nice !

    I am in US and it took 4 days to get to me.  I would feel safe ordering from them again so, im sure you will be fine with that option.

    OP, something I forgot to mention.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if you get a love letter from customs, that doesn't mean they'll flag your address and check for every single letter/package destined to your address...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think they'll flag you if they intercept a quite large quantity of drugs (let's say 0.5kg) or a fire weapon/terrorist paraphernalia........
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My 3 cents.

    hi guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i still haven't received the first package nor a customs letter, and its been over 2 months, so i guess that case is closed
    <br/>
    since then, i haveve ordered some speed and a few samples of coke from the netherlands, the speed was AWESOME, felt great and was not suicidal during the comedowns, however the coke was quite shitty (stuffy nose, giterryness, less than half turned into freebase)
    <br/>
    im gonna try delta next, but his listings always fly off the walls and i'm still learning how to encrypt my shipping adress
    <br/>
    by the way, all orders got through, super fast and without a problem, and I'm waiting on a domestic order of hash, and as i said, still no rcmp sending me to work camps in yukon, so yaaay !!!   ::)

    there are also two possibilities:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) package simply lost in transit, it happens!
    <br/>
    2) stolen
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had a envelope from Reich travel to Australia before it was redirected to canada.
