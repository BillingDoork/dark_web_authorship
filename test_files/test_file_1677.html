    I am not a vendor on here but ship to Sweden quite a lot, from UK, as long as it has half decent stealth it will pass easy enough. Not sure what it would be like sending from outside of EU though.

    To begin with some information on how the Swedish Postal Service Operates can be seen in the thread Mail Systems around the World: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172854.msg1240495#msg1240495

    Sweden and Australia most likely heavily profile Regions on how likely any drugs will arrive from there, so anything from example the Netherlands will have a much lower chance of making it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What one has to keep in mind the Customs Agencies in Sweden are in one sense very good at what they do BUT they are also extremely inefficient in other regards. There is no such concept of a controlled delivery here in Sweden as if the package is small enough it "will" be delivered straight to the Mail Box ( they can however start a surveillance operation if it's enough product ). What will happen instead is the Customs Agency will seize the package and eventually send a modified "Love Letter" up to ten months later ( I know specifically of a case like this ) asking the person to come in and explain why they got sent drugs in the mail - depending on if they have enough evidence or not they will decide based on this if it's enough to prosecute or not ( it was not enough in this case I'm familiar with, also go figure ten months later is not exactly efficient work by them :P ). Edit: Forgot to add they will occasionally execute a search warrant without any warning during this ten month period if they feel it's warranted, this is also highly erratic and they've actually done it for amounts as small as 5 grams if they think the person ordering fits a special profile - ie. they think they can "save" him from taking drugs in the future.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway my main point is the reason the Customs operate this efficiently is because of their extremely erratic nature in how they operate, probably not by design but that's just how it is. It's also kind of a Politics thing I'm suspecting as the Customs take their work A LOT more seriously than for example in Denmark. So if your packages can make it it's a good idea but there's a good reason Sweden/Australia have very high prices in general, and scamming is not one of the reasons at least for Sweden.

    Australia is tight compared to some other countries but most certainly not impenetrable, it is also a big market for those vendors who are wiling to take time and effort with their stealth to ensue orders land safely every time.

    I agree totally. some package can be seized but many people tries to look as a victim when they only were trying to scam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ship worldwide but for risky buyers and countries I ask to FE and tell customers to order at their own risk. And in most of times after change the FE conditions, all of my customers were receiving well all the orders.

    I live in Australia and have order stacks of stuff from overseas. I've had about a 90% success rate in all honesty and I also think that half of the remaining 10% is due to "samples" that have never even been sent in the first place. Weed from overseas has been the hardest thing to get past. But it all boils down to how effective your stealth is and whether or not you go the extra mile to make your letter/parcel appear as a genuine article.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Our customs are good at their job I'll give them that much but it really is a myth that Australia is hardest place of earth to ship to. And it certainly doesn'y justify the price gouching you see around here. The massive mark up's on the prices because the said item is specifically being shipped to Australia therefore the vendor is of the belif that they can charge more than they usually would because we're stupid enough to pay for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do ship to Australia please don't specifically inflate your prices because of the "extra risk" of sending to Australia. It's the customer who takes the risk there and not the vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope I've been some help to you.

    The thing is it's just not a question if the Customs Agency itself is the best in the world or not. Australia has the capability to route all international mail through very few centers ( I've even seen some suggest it all goes through one single facility  :o ) and there's obviously no way of smuggling by land without going by boat first. That coupled with the laws which have been enacted which seem to be some of the worst in the world all combine into this current situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing I find strange in this whole equation how come the demand is so high in Australia at all? From the thread Domestic Listings per Country/Region on Silk Road: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176825.msg1366571#msg1366571 one can see Australia has roughly 6 % of all listings on Silk Road which is the sixth highest of any Region.

    make sure your pack (better letter ) it's very well hidden with a good looking profile , like a graphic studio logo or something like that , respecting weight restrictions and sizes , without any smell .. your letter will arrive in Sweden and in Australia.

    Sweden is no problem if you use some sort of stealth. The only missing package I had so far was to Norway...
