    Hi everyone,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Vendors asking buyers living in OZ to finalize early ...Or will not sell  &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - A new member, no purchase history = ZERO trust! .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are either a potential scammer.
    <br/>
    Or an easy target. Using these two excuses to scam you!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I give up SR before I even started?  :'(

    I think you've made two threads on this forum, and both have made me feel like like smashing my head repeatedly into the wall. Are you that incapable of researching the wealth of knowledge on this damn forum. How about you do a few small domestic orders from trusted vendors before you throw yourself into the deep end and start ordering international packages. This will be another important factor in the fight to bring down SR - idiotic children who think they are on ebay and invincible with no idea of the possible ramifications. Considering you don't know how packages are delivered to your mailbox I highly suggest you do not order internationally. As I said, do some small domestic orders, increase your buyer stats and show you are trusted buyer, and actually have some idea of what is going on here. Gaining experience, whether it be domestic or not, is invaluable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I may sound harsh, but it is individuals like you who are making it more difficult for the Aussie SR community, and filling the forums with embarrassing/pointless threads is not going to fix this, it will just further confuse newcomers who will see this thread and will be immediately put off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Learn to walk before you can run and maybe, with a stroke of luck, you might have some success on the road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for your initial question, in all honesty, I think you should stick to sourcing your drugs locally, I do not think SR is for you.

    OK I might have made the MISTAKE of ordering BEFORE reading because I simply discovered SR before the community forums!
    <br/>
    It was like heaven's door opened right in front of you. It's hard to say no  8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ... and PLZ cut the crap about the search tool cuz it gives you nothing.

    If anyone Cannot bother replying newbies questions.. then do everyone a favor, and DON'T !
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the vendors who smells a newbie as an easy target. Shame on you  &gt;:(.  Karma is a bitch and will bite them back.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I made this thread to learn how to protect us from those kinda people. and I believe we should be given the customer's respect just like everyones else  &gt;:(.

    Before you think about creating a thread which makes other Aussies appear as stupid as you are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - lurk more

    - post your question in an already established thread

    Apparently the search function yields no information about the associated risks of domestic and international parcels, vendor reputation and navigating safely on SR.

    Please, do the entire community a favor and delete your account. If you are that blind and think there is no information on this forum that is going to benefit and guide you, you are a fucking idiot.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If all else fails, I suggest you ask Circero. However Cicero's valuable time and bandwidth should not be wasted, in which case, you would be wasting both - oh well.

    Because search is too hard/doesn't work I'll spell out what the others have hinted at.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ORDERING ILLEGAL DRUGS ONLINE FOR DELIVERY ACROSS BORDERS IS FUCKING ILLEGAL. Really fucking ILLEGAL. Order enough and when YOU GET CAUGHT (and YOU out of all people on SR WILL GET CAUGHT) you could END UP IN JAIL.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So for fuck's sake and your own, THINK before you start typing, ordering or putting your shoes on. If need be, get one of your parents to put 'left' and 'right' on them if that helps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bit harsh? Probably. But no where near as harsh as the judge will be.
