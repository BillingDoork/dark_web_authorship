    If someone puts an address down correctly on a package, but missteps slightly on the zip code, is it likely that the package will still get to the proper destination eventually? Does it matter if the proper zip code is only one county over from the false one? Thanks!

    It shouldn't be a big problem. It will usually just be delayed a bit.

    But it will probably mean that someone has to look at it manually and that's not something you want when ordering drugs. So next time, reeeeaally make sure that you've got the right address.

    I've talked to a lot of people about this, and this seems to be the general consensus. And I know, SUCH an amateur move, I got comfortable, and am now paying the price. It was quite a large package and an international one to boot, so I'm praying it'll make it for now. A few postal workers have told me if they can't figure it out, they'll send it back to the sender, which is no one and would loose me nearly 5k. Better than suits coming to my door though. Thanks!
