    I'm sure this is obvious for many, but from what I've seen of certain panicky posts and PMs and questions about mail deliveries it seems that not everyone is familiar with mail order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please get comfy with this! If you don't already get regular deliveries, one of the better ways to improve your odds of an uneventful shipment is to spend some time ordering other random crap online. The more unusual-yet-legitimate packages you get at your address-of-choice, the less likely your local mail sorter or deliverer will care about one or two oddly-shaped, stinky, or mis-addressed ones. So the next time you're worried about a package showing up, don't harass the vendor. Instead, go on eBay and buy some shit online. (I assure you it'll be less elegantly packaged than whatever your SR vendor comes through with.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're picking up at a PO box, a regular trickle of eBay / Amazon / etc pieces will get them used to your showing up to collect a selection of boxes.   You'll find out that just as the occasional "Held for Pickup" is no big deal,  nor should be your picking up a stack of padded envelopes and boxes filled with pills. Order SIM cards from China, find a boutique organic skin care line, get into herbal supplements - whatever. Or just wait until the next time you run low on Scotch tape or toothpaste or condoms (or kitchen spices or bulk orders of aspirin or jock itch powder or whatever else - the more innocent pills and powders you're getting, the better.) When you pick up your SR delivery you should look as casual as you do when you're grabbing an Amazon / eBay shipment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you order to your house and receive packages anyway, you probably don't need to worry so much. If you use a mail box - in your name or otherwise- please think about padding your orders. My youngest brother works at a mailbox service center and he says that it's almost laughably obvious who uses the place to hold packages because they're not at home during the day, and who's trying to distance themselves from something sketchy, and that where he's at, the owners are paranoid enough about being implicated themselves to flag anything that made them nervous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So as a buyer, please don't underestimate the second sense of your mailman, and please do whatever you can to increase the amount of legitimate mail and packages to your house / PO box! Putting a little time into a few other legal orders before placing one here, or making sure to maintain a stream of bland ones, is not likely to be something you'll regret. Plus as soon as you get a few shipments of powdered vegan baby formula from some hippie in NorCal without the post office batting an eye, you'll realize that what makes shit in the mail pulled is not always what it looks like, but how confidently and openly it's addressed and picked up.
