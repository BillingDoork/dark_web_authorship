    what is going on with royal mail? i have been waiting on a domestic order for a week, another domestic for 4days and i have 6 orders that i have posted domestic on thursday last week that have still not been delivered, i mean this is way to many orders for them all to go missing on a domestic order, i have seen a few other people saying they are taking the piss on a couple of other threads, they put there prices up and have got worse, i mean the fact the postman dont turn up until 2pm now is bad enough but all he ever brings me is bills, and no orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think the royal mail are on there way out and we are not far from seeing a fully privatized system run by companys that can get the post to your door by 8am like the good old days, they have gone down hill big time in the last few years and seem to be getting worse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    can anyone who actually work for them shed any light on this?

    Hmmm that's a bit weird. I think it's probably just the Jubilee that ballsed it up yano. They have been a bit off since then if I remember correctly.

    Have you asked the vendor if he sent out your stuff? I was screwing for several days thinking RM is taking the piss just to find out that the vendor hasn't sent my shit out yet. On the flipside, I had no problems with RM, all my stuff is coming in fine without any delay.

    yeah ive asked both the uk vendors and one was sent a week ago today and the other was sent 4days ago, and i know for sure the 6 orders i have sent have been posted and even mailed my buyers to ask if they had received yet and all said no, if it was just one id question it but its 6 orders in 4 different county's and then there is my orders so i has to be royal mail, cos its just to many to all go missing and ive never lost a package domestically, when your waiting for something its mega frustrating not to mention all the coins i need to re-up in escrow, and just to make it worse i have to wait til 2pm everyday to see if it comes or not

    The post was delayed for a day or so but it's back to normal now, I do regular control letters to myself just to make sure everything is fine.

    A lot of vendors, even well known ones with established reputations are just using the Jubilee bank holiday as an excuse, not that I can blame them, people have lives.

    As I said, some vendors are using it as an excuse. The post was held up 3 days most. I've been receiving and sending things worldwide the whole time with no issues other than what seems to be an extra day. I normally use standard Royal Mail First Class.

    The only thing I could thing it is then, is that I send all my stuff out as normal letters as it's not drug related (although is illegal), so perhaps normal letter envelopes aren't being subject to extra checks but parcel envelopes are? Makes sense...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This would also mean that this is ongoing, and will go on until the Olympics are over, not just something related to the Jubilee weekend which was ages ago now. The Royal Mail recovers from Christmas in days.

    oh well gee since its fine for you it must be fine for the other 100s of centers
    <br/>
    <br/>
    actually im waiting on a package from a reliable vendor its been 7 working days and it was first class. i had another outstanding order that came through though during that 7 days. i also had  a non-sr related 1st class package that took a week as well. but now ive got 2 outstanding orders im not buying anything and am preparing for the worst. considering they are seeming to deliver after 1pm and just generally are being complete shit cunts i hope its a fuck up rather than what i think it is
