    Hi SR loyalists and LE cuntrags,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How about this for a concept? Accepting orders (probably only bigger ones to make it worthwhile) and providing repackaging services for a percentage or some nominal fee.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem with SR into the future is customs profiling known SR vendors and intercepting their post. You could make money simply repacking something from a domestic vendor to an international vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would pay a lot of money for this service. I know some others who would as well. I have throught of a lot more reliable and safe ways to shit stuff around the world. A lot better than what I have seen. You could make a few hundred $USD for doing an hours work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Might sound like a stupid, risky idea. I have nfi... But it is a service that I require.

    It cant be done without some trust.. Do you really expect a vendor or buyer to trust someone with there cash/product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me get this straight
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example:1
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to buy 1 pound of weed from the states and I live in Canada.. I buy the weed and have it shipped to you. (in the states or canada) and then you send me my product. I'm supposed to just trust you with my product.. what happens if it gets lost or seized?!?!? I already paid someone else to get it to you and now you lose it... who pays me back???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am a seller in the states and dont want to ship to canada.. i can get you to ship for me.. so my client places an order from canada I send you the bud and you send it to him.. how am I supposed to trust that you will not pinch or keep the whole package all together then I am out product and mot probably a customer..or whjat if it gets seized will you offer a refund on what I lost???.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only way to do this is to BROKER the product... you buy it and then sell it to the person interested in your offer and that's the only way I see it working!

    Yes, this is already happening on SR and is more popular in the USA. We have a few sellers unofficially reselling our products to domestic buyers, even tho we ship there!

    Hell i'm a reshipper, thats how i make coin off SR cause aussie customs are fucked, people are scared to order from online. So i do it, put my markup on top of it, split the order into smaller parts i.e. order 1000 pills divide into 10pill strips, and charge then whatever i think is fair.

    I even asked the customers what they want. Dude there is alot of money to be made, just gotta get the right vendors to buy off, know your market well (there was a huge whole in the benzo market).
    <br/>
    Also be good with your customer service and they will keep on coming back. Don't be rude as shit and act all high and mighty, welcome the customer talk with them, answer their questions if you can't answer direct them to a place who can answer.
    <br/>
    Very easy gig, just set up P.O. boxes and get heaps of stuff in constantly and rip open the package, divide it down, put your markup on it, ship it out again. too easy

    Vendors do this all the time on their own. They will take the risk of buy a million XTC tabs, and then resell in the states at a mark up.

    cheers for all the responses folks . Agreed Cozmo, i guess everybody does it to a certain extent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I figured trust is involved in such an operation. But indifferent to the vendor/customer trust on SR. Just like a package non arrival needs to be accepted by a customer from ANY vendor, the same would apply to a re-shipper. The re-shipper would require good feedback though, so their success would depend on how clandestine their op was.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My line of thought is this: If you had a domestic re-shipper from a  big vendor, the odds of receiving will increase massively. I am convinced no shows are more to do with poor stelath as opposed to customs genius.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had 6/6 seiures from a vendor, more arrivals still coming through after, and all of the reships of the 6 didn't arrive either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I cant believe that 12/12 seiures occured... I am not particularly convinced of the integrity of a lot of the bigger vendors who can afford to lose a few feedback points. Stastics can be the cliched 'lies, damned lies and statistics' , but they have provided more facts to me over the course of my career than any fucking human! :)
