    I'm thinking about getting around 4-6 oz of different stuffs
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one package of 2 oz another of 1 oz 2 of 1/2 and 4 of 1/4
    <br/>
    <br/>
    will it be suspicious?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if I order bulk (a full pound) will that be suspicious?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    how much does doing it increase my chances of getting caught?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks for your advice again!

    Buy random odds and ends from ebay (small cheap electronics accessories eg cell phone covers or extra cell phone chargers work well) at the same time as the other purchases to add a legitimate mail screen. Beyond that, use reputable sellers (read feedback and look for comments about sloppy shipping), make sure your address is safe to deliver to (colleges, shared houses, apartments have more opportunity for theft/discovery/mis-delivery), and don't do anything stupid like using a fake name. Good Luck!

    It completely depends on who your vendor is. Some vendors on here will ship pounds of weed no problem, with ingenious stealth packaging.. and others I wouldn't feel so comfortable getting that much product from. Read all the feedback you can, and read the rumor mill if your vendor has a thread in the forums.
