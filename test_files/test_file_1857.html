    I am having a lot of trouble trying determine how to choose a good return address/name combination. Should I use a real name that is associated with that address or is a fake name safe? Should I make it look like it's coming from a business? Do they look anything upo when it is from a business or vice versa?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can /should multiple orders dropped at the same time be sent using same return addy?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do they look up return addresses to see if it's a valid address/not a forwarded address, etc? Also, they have removed most of the USPS blue boxes from my area so I have to go to the post office, am I safe doing this? Is there anything I should do differently as far as the return address being that I have to go to post office to drop mail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, does return address have to be the exact postal code of the post office, or can it be different as long as it's somewhat close to the post office? I am jsut trying to figure out what looks suspicious.

    Why not just look up a random business on Google Maps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then, you have a completely legitimate return address.

    It's generally accepted that using a business return address is safer. Use a real one and drop it in the post code where the business is.  If there are no blue boxes in your area you should find a way to make a drop in another area.  Whether that means have someone you trust(implicitly) drop it for you or make the trip yourself and ship less often, but it's alot safer for all involved.  IF anything were to get seized they could tell exactly where you dropped it off and pull up the cameras footage of you driving up and walking up to the counter and such.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, you don't want a bunch of drug-containing packages all originating from the same point, that makes it easy to profile them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck!

    A business return address is preferable. Print it on a nice label and go to the effort of adding a small business logo if you can find it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I would suggest finding a postbox to drop your stuff into (not all in the same one!) just to avoid cameras. Make sure that where you're dropping the items is close to your return address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't put masking agents such as coffee or perfume in/on your package. It's a dead giveaway when your package stinks like coffee and won't fool the dogs at all. You're aiming for no smell rather than overpowering the drug smell with something else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't put layers and layers of masking tape across your package, it's also a dead giveaway. One or two is enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lack of any of these precautions, taken individually, does not constitute a red flag whatsoever. HOWEVER, -if- your package noticed for whatever reason, taking these steps makes it look more legitimate and therefore makes it less likely that an overzealous postal inspector will decide to punch a hole in it and/or run it through x-ray.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.

    I use a randomly selected return address and it is different for every mailing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also never drop off at the same location twice. Remember you can drop in blue boxes, at the post office just inside the door there is usually a drop point, at the UPS store, at staples or other office supply places, at any non-postoffice mail store, hell you can stop some place and put it in someones mail box and raise the flag, There is almost always an outgoing mail box in apartment complexes, and I have even stopped a postman at 7-11 and handed it to him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You do not have to drop off in the area the return address is, lots of people and businesses drop mail off in different areas. Some on there way home, some on there way to work, sometimes they are out on a sales call for lunch and drop it off in a completely different town.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Get creative, there are lots of ways to get it into the mail and keep the drop off point random.

    Us either the return address of a known heavy drug abuser, or use the police department address.  In either case, you will know exactly what comes of RTS packages!

    The biggest question that has always been on my mind is what happens when a package is actually returned to sender for some reason and the business opens it up to find drugs. Then a 3rd party now has the buyers information and may contact authorities.

    If the buyer used a false name someone else at the address who was not aware of the package marked could returned to sender. Or buyer gave the wrong address.

    If a package doesn't get delivered it will eventually get opened anyway if it cannot be returned for any reason, at least if it gets returned to some random business there's a chance they either don't find the drugs or they just keep them without reporting it :)

    Ahh I figured they'd need a warrant anytime they opened mail so would just dispose of it without opening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: Interesting read on what does happen to packages that cant be delivered or returned.
