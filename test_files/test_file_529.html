    Alright, I'm fairly set to make my first order from SR. I have my money ready and my BTC exchange dealio in place, and my purchases selected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a friend who will be using their address to receive my package. However there area few things I want to be 100% sure about before going through with the transaction;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Should I put down my friends name, or create a fake one? I understand SR says to avoid using fake names, but would using my friends name/and having them receive my illegal package put him or her in any danger?
    <br/>
    2. When my friend receives the package, how soon should they bring it to me/ or have me pick it up? (I also understand that you should not open any packages where they were received)
    <br/>
    3. If in the future I want to order to my apartment, how would I go about doing that? Is that not as safe since there are locked mailboxes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just wanted to make sure I'm not missing any key steps in safety, if there's any other tips or precautions I should know please let me know! Thank you!

     Frequently Asked Questions / F*cking Asinine Questions
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, I've just finished scanning through 2,260 threads in this subforum. Hooray for free time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     About 80% of the threads focus on the following questions. I'm going to provide the typical answers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. My package hasn't arrived, what should I do?
     <br/>
     There are a couple of possibilities:
     <br/>
     a) Your package is on its way, keep waiting
     <br/>
     b) Your package has disappeared. LE may have got it, postal service may have lost it. It got sent but it's not going to arrive.
     <br/>
     c) The seller didn't send it (and I'll bet you finalized early)
     <br/>
     d) LE has it, and what happens next depends on the size of the order and the workload of your LEOs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In all of the above situations, it's reasonable to:
     <br/>
     a) Contact your seller politely and see if they can shed any light on the problem
     <br/>
     b) Clean house. Make sure you have no paraphernalia or drugs in your shipping address.
     <br/>
     c) Go on with your life as usual; if you are in some way compromised any unusual activity will be incriminating. Remember, you know nothing about the drugs coming to you in the mail.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you've been through all of these steps, a reasonable amount of time (normal shipping + 5 business days) has passed, and still no package by all means start a forum topic asking for further advice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2. What do I do if LE come to my door?
     <br/>
     Deny any knowledge of the illegal contents of your package. Don't go into detail, don't make up stories, DON'T SAY ANYTHING apart from 'I don't know what you're talking about'. Politely decline any requests to enter your address or accompany LE anywhere. If you're arrested (and your country allows this right) USE YOUR RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. Politely decline to answer any questions and ask for legal representation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Providing that you maintain a clean house (no drugs in the house, no paraphernalia, no other illegal material) and a clean computer, you should have very little to worry about in most cases.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unless, you've moving large amounts and LEO have been building a case. Then you might be in trouble. But, the above response remains the best.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3. Should I use my own name and address?
     <br/>
     It depends. Yes with a but, no with an if.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Yes, if you are buying small amounts and can maintain a clean house (no drugs in the house, no paraphernalia, no other illegal material) then it is most likely OK to use your name and address. The key point to this is to maintain 'plausible deniability'. You should have no criminal history, a clean house, and be smart enough to follow the advice in #2 above should things go sour. The benefit of using your address and name is reliability, and plausible deniability. You are much more likely to be able to claim innocence signing for a package at your own door than you are showing up to a PO box in a fake name at 3am.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Variations on this theme are sending mail to your current address under a different name. In some countries this can work, others it will cause problems. The way to find out if it'll work for you is to send test letters to your intended address. If they make it, odds are the package will (excepting LEO interference). A potential spanner in these works is the delivery that unexpectedly requires a signature... Consider that carefully before choosing to go with this method. This option may also affect plausible deniability (easier to claim no knowledge of drugs in your own mail, than drugs in another person's mail that you have kept or opened).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you're moving large amounts, or if you for whatever can't maintain a clean house, you should probably have something RELIABLE set up that isn't your name and address. It's on you to figure out how, mister Escobar.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     4. Should I sign for deliveries?
     <br/>
     You should choose a seller who does not require signing for deliveries.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the event that you're unexpectedly asked to sign, weigh up the situation:
     <br/>
     How much did you order? Do you have a criminal history or history of seized packages? Did you use a reputable seller? Did you use your real name and shipping address
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If, for example you ordered 500g of cocaine, have a conviction for trafficking cocaine, have had several cocaine shipments not arrive, ordered from a vendor in Colombia with crappy feedback and had it shipped to a fake address; then you would be clearly making a mistake by signing for that package.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If on the other hand you ordered a 3 blotters of LSD, are squeaky-clean, have nothing illegal in your house, ordered from a reputable vendor and had it shipped to your house in your name then it would actually be more suspicious if you DIDN'T sign for the package.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Most cases will be somewhere in the middle. Weigh up the above factors and see where you sit; it's a good idea to have this decision made ahead of time for all orders you make, to avoid being caught out if the unexpected happens.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     5. I'm Australian, and...
     <br/>
     Good for you. Stop posting the same questions over and over, you're not doing yourself any favors. Anyone would think that Australians make up the majority of SR users from the amount of posts on here regarding Aus.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The general consensus from what I've read:
     <br/>
     95% of international shipments make it through Aus customs
     <br/>
     Aus customs DO NOT appear to routinely send love letters for illegal drugs, there is only one instance on this board of that happening. Generally they just go missing.
     <br/>
     You're much safer to buy domestic (e.g. EnterTheMatrix claims a near-perfect domestic shipping success rate and their feedback backs this up). If you don't like the prices, by all means buy internationally but know that you are taking a risk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     6. How long does shipping from X to Z take?
     <br/>
     Google it. Honestly...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you must know specifics, PM your intended vendor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     7. Some packages failed to arrive, is it safe to keep using this address?
     <br/>
     Short answer, no. It may just be unlucky that you didn't get your packages (see #1 above), but the key word is SAFE. No, it is not SAFE. You can continue to use it, but at increased risk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's not impossible to get a new receiving address. This would be a good prompt to explore your options.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     8. I got a letter from LE, what do I do?
     <br/>
     If you got a letter, three things are likely true:
     <br/>
     a) Your receiving address is no longer safe
     <br/>
     b) The package that was intercepted was not, on it's own, worth arresting you or raiding your house
     <br/>
     C) You can do yourself no good by saying ANYTHING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Shred the letter, clean your house, go on with your life. Take a month or two off, and get a new receiving address if you choose to come back. If LE show up at your house, follow the advice in #2
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ==========================
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, hopefully this post will be useful to some people and cut down on the same questions being asked over, and over again.

    So I should use my friends real name then?

    I'm only ordering a small amount (about 6 pills), but I'm still figuring out how all this works and I just want to be extra cautious.

    How should I approach someone to ask them to take my delivery then?

      Aus customs DO NOT appear to routinely send love letters for illegal drugs, there is only one instance on this board of that happening. Generally they just go missing.
      <br/>
      You're much safer to buy domestic (e.g. EnterTheMatrix claims a near-perfect domestic shipping success rate and their feedback backs this up). If you don't like the prices, by all means buy internationally but know that you are taking a risk.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      6. How long does shipping from X to Z take?
      <br/>
      Google it. Honestly...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If you must know specifics, PM your intended vendor.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      7. Some packages failed to arrive, is it safe to keep using this address?
      <br/>
      Short answer, no. It may just be unlucky that you didn't get your packages (see #1 above), but the key word is SAFE. No, it is not SAFE. You can continue to use it, but at increased risk.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It's not impossible to get a new receiving address. This would be a good prompt to explore your options.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      8. I got a letter from LE, what do I do?
      <br/>
      If you got a letter, three things are likely true:
      <br/>
      a) Your receiving address is no longer safe
      <br/>
      b) The package that was intercepted was not, on it's own, worth arresting you or raiding your house
      <br/>
      C) You can do yourself no good by saying ANYTHING
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Shred the letter, clean your house, go on with your life. Take a month or two off, and get a new receiving address if you choose to come back. If LE show up at your house, follow the advice in #2
      <br/>
      <br/>
      ==========================
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So, hopefully this post will be useful to some people and cut down on the same questions being asked over, and over again.

    Well some of that helped, but I was hoping for more specifics pertaining to my questions. I've already read through most of these posts already, and like I said, I'm only buying a small amount of pills. I just want to know the safest way to go about receiving the delivery. This was helpful about with LE parts though so thank you! :)

    You seem to be looking for easy answers, to questions that don't really have easy answers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You need to do lots of reading of these here forums and get a feel for the variety of opinions that exist on these matters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stop looking for an easy, parental style, answer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alternatively, consider the possibility that buying illegal drugs online isn't the best option for you.

    This has been mentioned many times before. It probably is unwise to ask someone to handle your delivery for you because if they get busted, they will give you up faster than Rick Astley's evil twin. It has been recommended many times that you use your real address and name (you can do a search for "real address" to check this out yourself). If you receive many packages already (i.e. from amazon, ebay), then it will look like nothing out of the ordinary. Of course, it is also heavily recommended to research the seller to make sure their packaging and conduct is professional.

    haha, No I don't live at home with my parents, and I'm not a kid, nor am I a he.

    Please stop assuming. I can order to my apartment but I don't know if that requires any different steps, and I'm just trying to find the safest way to go about this, like I said I'm relatively new to this. I will just read the forums more before asking anything else. Thank you.

    if u gettin pillz' figgure out the best vendor double check. ask questions

    <br/>
    when it boils down to it, US GOVERMENT needs to warrant any search or seizure'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so the only way you get caught , is that the people your working with don't know what there doing
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in most cases, you'll get USPS priority box' safely just have them pack it up nice so if it were to open it wont be seen
