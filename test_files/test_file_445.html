    I have the DCN to my package, the vender was kind enough to give it to me. It says it was delivered to my town and everything but its not in my p.o box. I am pretty much screwed? How did the post office lose a package it was delivering to its own p.o box? This is stupid, i asked the post office and everything and they say they will look tomorrow. Has this happened to anyone else with success or should i just count this as a lost package. There is an oz of shrooms that i payed good money for so i dont really want to lose them.

    It's a possibility they've entered the DCN as being delivered to your PO box but cbf putting it in there and just too lazy to look right away...
