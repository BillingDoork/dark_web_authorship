    I'm wondering what takes so long for an item to get from NL to USA. What's the process that the item undergoes?

    I wish this would be more clear as well. You'll notice a lot of people suggesting to stay away from NL shipments but others receive their packages from there regularly. If you read through vendor reviews, you'll see an almost 50/50 divide between those in the US receiving their stuff and those left empty handed. My theory is that NL shippers selectively choose NOT to ship out but set the status to In Transit anyway and rely on a partial refund. This would allow them to make money with no effort, while racking up positive reviews from the few they do actually ship. My reason for suspecting this is that I often see reviews where single pills fail to make it over. I really can't imagine how a vendor would fail to stealth a single pill unless they just threw it in an envelop and sent it off. I digress, would love to hear from someone who has more details about the actual shipping process.
