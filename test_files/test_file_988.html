    I have shipped a few things using these, because (as far as I know) they are the only way to do express mail without having to go in and pay for shipping on your specific package - I can just buy stamps, and then ship whenever I want, without going into the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My concern is that the shipping label that comes with them has multiple ink copy/layers and I (think) I have to fill it out by hand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can I just print out a customer's address and put it on a flat rate express mail envelope, along with the stamp, and drop it off in a drop-box.  My concern is that its not acceptable since the normal shipping label has multiple copies, or just unusual, causing suspicion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do people think is the best way to ship using USPS express mail?

    So, do people think it is safe to hand write the addresses?  I don't really see a problem myself, but I know a lot of people seem to think it is better to use printed addresses.

    Express flat rate envelopes are 99% used for document delivery by major companies...... Piggyback off them or you run a REAL risk of getting your packages seized if they look out of the ordinary at all with that type of mail.

    Thats not true. Considering that the step up from the envelope is a $35+ box,  those things get stuffed all the time.

    I don't even like handwriting addresses on my normal mail but handwriting seems to be necessary to ship by express in that manner.

    Yes, I have shipped a good number of packages in express flat rate envelopes.  If its small/flat I just put it in a normal envelope, wrapped in some paper.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For bigger orders, I just make sure to wrap it enough so that it just feels like a consistant, solid object.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hand write address and return address, and waige the signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have never had one not get delivered, but I feel like there should be a better way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I may just have to not offer express so I can do everything printed out, but that would be unfortunate for customers who really want to get something fast.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are the major reasons people are wary of handwritten addresses?  It doesnt seem so uncommon to raise suspicion to me?  Am I wrong there?  Do people just not like it because it is "personal" and would be more likely to be linkable to you in some way (handwriting, ink, more risk of finger prints)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there another way to ship express?  My understanding is that for non-flat-rate, you have to go in and get each package weighed and buy the stamp for the specific package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do people tend to just think the priority flat rate is a better idea since you can buy stamps in bulk, and can print shipping labels, making it the least unique shipping parcel?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm new to all this, so any advice is appreciated!  I read as much as I can but I get some conflicting viewpoints about what the best way to ship is (as far as first class vs priority vs express and how to do addresses) I think I have the internal packing figured out.

    They aren't going to "profile" express packages for having the information handwritten since that's required when using the form.

    You can throw an express package with normal stamps on it in the blue box?  Wouldn't that be the ONLY flat rate express box with stamps on it?  lol

    I was recently told by the postal workers that I should also hand write addresses on priority mail now after the ricin scare. I'm not sure if this is becoming standard now but I do it since its what i was told.

    International shipments using express services like DHL are problematic but my research hasn't led me to believe that domestic USPS express shipments are likely to get seized unless the sender does something stupid.  Typical domestic SR shipments are for small quantities that can easily be disguised as business documents, but even non-documents should go through if properly packaged, etc.  They do have a lot of express boxes available at the post office after all.  But shipping in an express flat-rate document envelope (and under 13oz) is best in my opinion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The biggest problem is USPS express is that it doesn't offer 1-day service everywhere and even when it does the packages often don't make it by the next day.  USPS will also just lie and claim they made a delivery attempt (before the deadline) when they didn't.
