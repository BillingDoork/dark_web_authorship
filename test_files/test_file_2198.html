    Hi
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the country I reside in, and perhaps yours, it is usual for domestic post that is sent on a Friday to not be delivered until Monday. It will sit in a delivery centre over the weekend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think this poses an additional risk by having an order sit within the postal system for a longer period of time than is needed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ordering earlier in the week may help mitigate that risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?
    <br/>

    This information pertains to USPS in the USA:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We still get delivered mail on Saturdays, but nothing happens on Sunday (except iirc transferring between the very large regional sort facilities).  I've considered this question in the past myself and done some research, and although I don't believe it poses an extra risk, if I had the option I'd prefer not to do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, it increases the amount of time that the package is "out there" for something to happen (like the sorting facility catching on fire, being robbed, being hit by a tornado), but it's just sitting in a large crate or bag chillin' (depending on whether it is a standard flat rate package type or not).  There is no mail being delivered or processed on Sunday because there are no postal workers working.  If there are no postal workers working, there's no increased risk of a postal worker "discovering" your package or considering it more suspicious than all the others in the bin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Conclusion?  In the USA at least, I believe that there is NO significant increase in risk unless the package had a scent which could accumulate while not moving around, resulting in the possibility of it being noticed on Monday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is probably somewhat similar in your country.  Again, logically speaking: If there aren't postal workers working, there aren't postal workers noticing anything.   :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helps!
