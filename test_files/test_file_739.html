    Just wondering why, when we have the legal right to wear a mask anywhere we want, that no one does? Yeah sure they might flag every package you send, but the more people do this the more they will have to accept our right to anonymity.

    And before anyone actually tries to do such a thing it is illegal to wear a mask in public in AL, CA, CT, DC, DE, FL, GA, MA, MI, MN, NC, NM, NY, OH, OK, SC, VA, and WV.
