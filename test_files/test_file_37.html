    Hello ,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We have never had a package been caught before , we have shipped all over the world very successfully using a proven method of shipping. Even getting past notoriously difficult countries customs system .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am naturally very cautious but ,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The buyer states that they got a call from customs saying package has been caught ? I thought this strange as how would customs know their telephone number ? Also the status of the package still says submitted to clearance , and on the originating postal site says it been handed over to Finland, for delivery .   I though it would state item sent to be destroyed or something similar .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The buyer will probably want a full refund , but what about  the cost of the postage , i am to pay that as well ?  We try very hard to keep our feedback score at 100 and if i do not treat this right and correctly they might ruin the feedback , but at the same time i do not want to be played , if you know what i mean .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if any one has any advice . it will be most appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kind regards

    Finland is a very small country. If someone uses their real address and gets caught, the customs office will look up the address for any information records, there include the phone number. Most of the cases there is one included, if there is not, they come knock your door.
    <br/>
    Finland is also notorious for it's extremely strict customs, as only 5mil people are living here, there is not that much postal traffic from outside and they have enough resources to fully investigate most foreign packages.

    if tracking says submitted to custom for clearance for more than 48 hours most likely its caught. If its prescription med they will ask for valid prescription to release it. My success rate to Finland is like 50%.

    i think it sounds a bit iffy with customs calling there home personally, when it is rare enough to get a letter of seizure?

    I have also gotten phone calls from the customs. If they don't find your phone number, only then will they send a letter of seizure or come to your home door. All you gotta do is deny deny and deny and not know about anything. They cannot prosecute the first time though, but usually if you get caught the second time they can press charges, usually for personal amounts and small amounts its a fine ranging from 200€ to 1000€.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In Finland it's usually just two choices for a destination address, either an anonymous PO box or to your residence. The PO Box option is strongly not advised because post to these addresses are opened by the customs always, so your residental address is much safer, but as we have learned from this, it isn't bullet proof either.

    The part on the opening of post is absolute 100% utter bullshit. While the post destined to a poste restante address goes through more security the people in the customs don't open the post without probable cause (K9 marking the letter/package, inconsistencies showing on xray etc.)
    <br/>
    If they'd open all the post they'd be breaking the law every time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Safest way of ordering is using a real household address and denying everything if you get caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And yes. The Finnish customs are one of the worst. While their budget is small, they work hard. Medicine is easily detectable as some of the mail goes through xray machines and pills can easily be picked up.
