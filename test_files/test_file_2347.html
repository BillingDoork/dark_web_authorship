    For obvious reasons I'm going to be vague here. I ordered something small from a well established vendor with whom I've done business with several times in the past. It was shipped domestic with USPS priority roughly a week ago. In the past these packages have always arrived within two days and yet it has now been over a week and nothing. Has anyone ever had a priority package arrive after over a week of waiting?

    Ask for a DCN, its possible it was incorrectly addressed, lost, stolen, or they might just haven't sent it out yet, and mistakenly marked it "in transit".Â  Ask the vendor whats up
