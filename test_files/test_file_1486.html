    Anyone know how to get around having your face seen on Camera and having to provide your identity when shipping parcels in the USA Domestically?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking about shipping cigarettes by the carton US Domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I feel like the best thing to do is find a way where you can repeat the shipping process without being caught on camera or having to give your Driver's License while mailing...does anybody know a good way to resolve this?

    Hey Uno,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Under no circumstance should you ever be providing identification while shipping domestically. That said, people ship cigarettes all the time with relative ease. You just show up with everything well-packaged, say in a priority mail flat rate box, labeled with the correct postage, and hand it over the counter. You can figure out what it would cost to mail whatever sized parcel via the USPS website. There's also still a few post offices out there without cameras, too. It's a matter of finding these places and appearing confident.

    Hm, I'm going to do some testing on this later, but I think if I followed your above mentioned advice to the tee as it stands now it wouldn't work comfortably.
