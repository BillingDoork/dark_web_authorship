    I'm in awe about the service Silk Road offers, although sketched out by the idea of tying my name onto the package I receive.  Does anyone wanna talk about simple or elaborate methods of receiving packages anonymously without using their real names?

    I don't know what your living situation is but send a controlled delivery to yourself under a fake name. If it shows up you're probably good to use a fake name for purchases on this site.

    Your options are to change your first name into an acronym (eg. Rob Roberts = R. Roberts) or to mis-spell a letter from your first or last name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I DO NOT RECOMMEND EITHER OPTION.  USE YOUR REAL NAME !!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your postal carrier knows who you are (on paper) and having things sent to you that are out of the ordinary (using a fake name) is what's going to draw attention.  Your mail carrier has to sort through a few thousand pieces of mail a day.  They've seen and scanned your address into their memory hundreds of times for mail coming to your address.  If you change the title on the address they're gonna pause when sorting at that letter to confirm the address.  Do you want that? (A: no lol, you want em to just scan through your mail like the rest).

    Consider looking into using a virtual office for receiving packages and having them addressed to a business name, preferably the same one you used to sign up for the virtual office. Virtual offices will receive mail on your behalf, and they often do not require real/any identification to sign up. This approach has been covered pretty well elsewhere in the forum, so I'll refer you to the search engine for details.

    As far as I know, most virtual offices I know of ask for either ID or a real credit card to pay with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would like to know some more methods as well, for example - If person-to-person mail is more often intercepted, what about if you write like a fictive domain-name like cheapwares.com and have a mailbox with a label that says "CHEAPWARES.com" will it be more likely to be intercepted, or sorted as business-to-individual mail ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, what if it's larger quantities, you probably wouldn't use your real name in any case ?

    How about folks who have moved/died from your address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After 10 years at this address I STILL get junk mail addressed to the deceased owner who lived here before me!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look for opportunities!

    This was a question I had as well. I'm extremely excited about purchasing, but a little sketched on teh recieving side of things. I plan to order a few things (digital goods and books) first and then moving on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOt that i know anything, but I'm hoping to see how those get through before order other things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would it be better to get stuff sent to my house or to send to a friends residents instead? That way the ordering is done from one house and the recieving at another.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice is greatly appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace.

    My feelings are that you should order to your own address OR a PO box that you pick up from under any name. While it's certainly true that your name and address will probably be flagged if LE intercepts, it's more likely that fake names will draw more attention. I dunno about using a friends address either, I mean how does your friend feel about that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would be good to hear from people who have received letters from their friendly government agencies about interceptions - like why do you think it was sniffed out? Did you use a fake name?
