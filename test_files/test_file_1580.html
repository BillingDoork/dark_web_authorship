    Hello
    <br/>
    I got my first 2 orders today.
    <br/>
    I accepted the orders and now I see :
    <br/>
    auto finalize 17 days.
    <br/>
    No money arrived.
    <br/>
    How does this works ? I must send my order to the buyer ? And when it arrives I will get my bitcoins?
    <br/>
    (pretty weird cuz then he can scam me to ?)

    thats what the escrow system is for :) and yes buyers can scam ! thats where a bit of blind faith comes into it. Some vendors want FE but if u havent stated that then I guess you will have to wait until the buyer has received your product and released the funds.

    Anyone else a little uneasy to have a vendor shipping product to customers with zero idea of how the system works???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No offense meant realdeals, but for the safety of your customers, you might consider a little more research into how all of this works before you start.

    read up on the escrow system :) after the 17 days if you haven't got your btc it will auto-finalize ! if theres a problem then the order can go into resolution. You should know this seeing as your a vendor ;)

    Respectfully, I'm not trying to put you down or make you look like a fool, but it should be a concern for both you and your potential customers that you are dealing drugs and don't understand how you get paid. Do you understand the best stealth shipping practices? Maybe you do, but what evidence is there that your customers should trust their lives with you?

    Yah not trying to put you down either, but you sound inexperienced with safety. Please make sure you are doing EVERYTHING possible to keep your shipments safe. I would suggest more research before you send out more product.

    REALDEALS don't be cocky. Nobody here was putting you down or talking shit. So don't talk trash he was just speaking truth. The fact that you asked this question proves you're not ready to be a vendor. suck my shit bitch.

    Something that has bothered me terribly if that people get vendor accounts and put up listings without having a CLUE about how SR works. Really? You spent $500 on a vendor account without knowing the basics? It baffles me at times how people chose to become vendors without ever being buyers first for some time.

    Yeah, this makes me feel uneasy, too. You'd have to either be a complete moron paying that type of money to become a vendor &amp; not know what to do, or your a fed trying to see how SR operates.... Not accusing anyone, just saying it seems a little weird

    I think johnny law would know how this works.  Unless this is the stupid awkward guy in the office fishing for a headline bust in a swimming pool.  Kinda just sounds like a kid who dropped money on an idea and just hopes he figures it out as he goes.  But, if you are johnny law then go eat a bowl of dicks.

    I don't mean this harshly but consider this-&gt; If you want to get more people to buy off of you from the beginning and for a very long time; Be courteous, keep a cool head, don't include emotions that are immature for professional business, and use good grammar.  I can't begin to tell you how much of a downer it is if I see a page written in Caps Lock at an elementary school grammar level.  My grammar isn't perfect (or even great), but I keep it understandable and organized.  I usually do not order off of vendors who sound like they are hard headed, easily ticked off, or constantly on an emotional defensive. People want someone professional (this includes knowing every detail about safety and selling on SR) and mature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I doubt that you will get many orders from older members until you become more professional. People just won't feel safe when they think that they are ordering off of an inexperienced child :/ It looks like you have come off to a bad start here, but, if you are an honest and sincere person your business should do just fine m8 :)  Don't take anything that is said harshly either, most of us just want to help!

    Most of these come'n'go vendors prob come in with this thought of "I get to sell drugs from the safety of my own own...Im going to be RICH  8)" not actually understanding what the vendors on here actually put themselves through or how to conduct their business whilst being a vendor.
