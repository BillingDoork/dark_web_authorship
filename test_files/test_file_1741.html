    Wow.  You posted the locations, the times, the shipping service and the contents of the package for all of the world to see.... :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package was intercepted.  Well now they can match your Silk Road identity to the identity of your drop.

    Yah there is a good chance they are trying to call you because they suspect something in the package. Were the pills rattling around in the package? that could have alerted them.

    Come to find out the shipping info i posted was for a wrong track # i was giving by the shipper.. But when i checked my CORRECT track it also says "CONTACT FOR PROOF OF DELIVERY"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv read before where they say "Package held" when they feel their is a issue.. Its only a small amount of stuff..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean they have the drop address clear as day on the Package.. Why would they want me to call when they can just do a CD? But i HIGHLY DOUBT im gonna find out by calling, fuck that..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wanted to see others ideas..  Again like i said there were about 10 packs sent and they all say "contact DHL"

    This happened one time when my friend was ordering a research chem from china. this doesn't mean it will happen to you but be carefull! when you call dhl if something is suspected they will probably forward you to dhs.  the DHS is essentially a bunch of retarted cops. you don't want to call them they will try to incriminate you just like every other scum cop. Anything you say can be used against you!

    Like above, why the fuck would you use DHL? They dont need a warrant to open your shit. Almost better off risking shipping it through customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you call, there goes your deniability. How would you even know they want you to call unless you tracked the package? That proves right there that you're expecting something.  Can't use the "I didnt order shit, who sent me this???" excuse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plus calling and you coming to them is what LE would prefer because they are lazy. Why spend the money on a CD when they can just mark it as CALL and the receiver may just be stupid enough to call.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Clean house. Consider it a loss and just see what happens. They show up wanting to make the delivery, use your gut judgment. Better to lose the money than your freedom.

    You fucked up by having so many packages sent OP.. You said 10 packages were sent via DHL? This in itself could be a red flag, and your buddy is not a highly rated SR vendor I'm guessing, so why would you have him send you drugs in the mail? Much less internationally...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use your better judgement man, your friend should have just kiestered the 40 pills, shit..
