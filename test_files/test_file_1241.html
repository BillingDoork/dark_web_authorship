    I have a legitimate home based business. I dont use the business much anymore, but I still get lots of spam mail (to my house) addressed to the business name.
    <br/>
    Would it be more suspicious or less suspicious if I ordered a couple of grams of powder from Europe to the USA and put my address in the following format:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    John Doe or Current business owner
    <br/>
    Name of Business LLC
    <br/>
    1111 Main St
    <br/>
    Anytown, State, Zip11
    <br/>
    USA
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously I would use my real name and everything, I'm just curious if customs looks at packages addressed to businesses more closely (to make sure businesses are paying proper taxes or customs) or am i worrying over nothing?
    <br/>
    Am i better off just addressing the package to my name and leaving out anything to do with the business?

    It doesn't matter either way. (although a vendor might prefer a persons name over a business).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After reading that story on The Smoking Gun yesterday, the gov't has it covered. They have all of us covered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll repost here in case you didn't catch it. - It was about the whole Ricin case, which I think was all staged to garner "Sympathy for the Devil"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but an amazing revelation came out that was more intriguing than another bullshit Ricin story;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Ricin Suspect Was Tracked Via Mail Scanners"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Feds: Postal Service photographs every piece of mail it processes"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    JUNE 7--A high-tech computer system that captures images of  “every mail piece that is processed” by the United State Postal Service was critical in helping federal agents track the Texas woman arrested today for allegedly sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In a U.S. District Court complaint filed today against Shannon Guess Richardson, an FBI agent details how investigators traced the ricin letters back to New Boston, Texas, where the 35-year-old Richardson (seen below) lives with her husband.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Bloomberg letter was opened at a municipal mail center in Manhattan on May 24, while the letter to Obama was intercepted May 30 at an off-site White House mail facility. A third ricin letter--sent to an anti-gun group funded by Bloomberg--was received at a Washington, D.C. office on May 26.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to FBI Agent James Spiropoulos, investigators accessed a Postal Service computer system that “incorporates a Mail Isolation Control and Tracking (MICT) program which photographs and captures an image of every mail piece that is processed.” Agents were able to obtain front and back images of about 20 mail pieces that had been processed “immediately before the mail piece addressed to Mayor Bloomberg.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A review of that mail revealed that each piece carried return addresses listing zip codes in the New Boston area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A similar analysis of 40 mail pieces that were processed “immediately before and after the mail piece addressed to President Obama” showed that several of those letters listed addresses in two Texas cities near New Boston.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to the felony complaint against Richardson, she confessed yesterday to “mailing the three letters--knowing that they contained ricin.” She repeated earlier claims that her husband Nathaniel, who has not been charged, was involved with the Obama and Bloomberg mailings. Richardson alleged that her spouse “typed the letters and made her print and mail them,” reported Agent Spiropoulos.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If convicted of the ricin mailings, Richardson, an aspiring actress, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and fine of up to $250,000.
