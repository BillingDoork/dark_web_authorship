    hey teddy bears and badasses,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i thought i would be quite useful to buy some used android phone and set it up as a GSM camera.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can hide it pretty much anywhere and be able to check whats going on 100 yards or 100 miles away (with some other phone / tablet / computer).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think it should be easy to set up and a great security measure to use at ur drop (if not ur own house).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i try to find info on how to do it but only find WLAN setups which are not the best of options for this

    Yeah it actually may be a good idea to hide the people doing the surveillance but I wouldn't watch it from too far away because if you see someone steal your stuff what good is it if you're 50 miles away?

    true.... but you can e.g. have a buddy watch from his home computer and give you info over the phone.
    <br/>
    but even if the situation happens you describe, youd still be much better off that without the phone  ;)

    Well it's better if you know who steals your stuff but it could be pretty difficult to find him again... Unless you run a really big operation.

    that part is easy... just need:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a phone that can do the speed
    <br/>
    a provider that can
    <br/>
    a service that will
    <br/>
    an area that has that service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    which obviously is depending on your country. got to do the research

    This ^^ OP great idea also though. I'v had survalince cams at my back and front door for 5 years and it has saved me from a few issues in that time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also you can find them very cheap! I think when i bought the set i have it was about 80 bucks , they have sound as well . I have each hooked to a small regular tv for each.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im thinking of posting one in my front yard on a tree aiming it down at my mail box as well.

    It;s a good idea to setup survellience on your drop i just don't see where you could hide the camera unless you climb the roof of an adjacent building.  In that case, you have many more options than using a built in camera on a phone. Even then eventually some maintenance worker or property manager will find it.

    dont cheap out on cams. period. if you want reliability go professional. listen, its about staying out of the squad car right? there are some very simple and extremely reliable products out there which wont break the bank.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the OP's idea is great for bright sunny days and few shadows. once you get into twilight and dark you're fucked. you need cams with infrared LED's which allow you to see in the dark. CCTV is all about lighting and when there is low or no light you might as well have nothing. the 5-0 are sneaky and dont just scope out a place in broad daylight. think about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    next what about airtime and data usage? there are simple IP solutions which will be WAY more reliable and last you alot longer. oh and also cost you nothing after the initial hardware set up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if anyone wants a professional list of devices you can purchase let me know. I'm pretty versed and am willing to help others.

    ip cam do have a lot of advantages.
    <br/>
    but they also have disadvantages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the mobile phone thing works almost everywhere. Its also untraceable unless you are a total moron. For use at your home other solutions are better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "so is there an app already? there must be."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mentioned an app on the other site. works fine. only takes pictures but has motion detection. This is easy on the traffic as well. Can take and upload a picture every second when there is motion if ur connection is fast enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where to hide it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    depends on the location (duh!)
    <br/>
    got to be creative (...)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there is much more locations that you think of at first try.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EG: put it in plastic and put it in the ground.
    <br/>
    go there, ge tie your shoes and grab a hand full of dirt of the ground. make a plastic bag and model (glue, whatever) that dirt on the part of the mobile that will stick out of the ground.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you can't think of something just take a walk and film the area with a HD cam. watch it at home. good ideas will come.

    Btw there are battery packs with 10.000+ mAh which will make the phone last for 3+ days, depending on the phone itself even much longer.
    <br/>
    Can you say anything about the battery usage with the motion detection function?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still think it's an ingenious idea. I will be remotely observing my drop soon ;-) Finding a place to hide it should be no issue... just be creative like flashlight said :D

    will need to test that. unfortunately the display needs to be ON for the app to work, but at least i can disable the light completely. me will run a full test soon
    <br/>
    also still got trouble with not being able to disable that f**king camera sound.  &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there is a forum for the app i suggested. just check the site in G play store. If there is more ppl liking the idea, we can discuss experiences here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    yea... if anything goes wrong, just disable the connection to whatever server you had the pictures uploaded to, cut your losses and move on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    who else likes the idea? then we can test and share results.
    <br/>

    me will run a full battery test.
