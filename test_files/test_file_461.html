    I assume the Australian government is something like the United States and would love nothing more than to brag about how many convictions they have gotten from this. Sounds to me like they are just trying to scare people to not use it.

    What is the customs guy on about. Sure I don't know for SURE if the X item I received is what the seller says it is, but I sure as hell prefer an option where faulty dealers are shamed and decried, than buying off the street where I have little to no choice as to what I'm actually getting.
    <br/>

    Also I have the hots for DPR at the moment, and I'm secretly wishing he's a she.
