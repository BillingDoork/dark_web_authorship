    I recently made a large bulk order from a reputable vendor who offered a 75-100% reship or refund policy at the timeÂ  of purchase. Unfortunately it now appears to have been siezed by customs, judging by the tracking number. Obviously I dont want any more attention from LE, especially as a legit address and name were used, so a reship is out of the question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem is that seller is only offering a 40% refund despite the fact he can see fron the tracking number it is in customs and to reship would be crazy for me. Im genuinely not sure if this fair or not. Any advice? cheers

    I would say at least 50% is what you're entitled to.

    That's what I thought. Guess I'll have to ask the SR to step in.

    This is why you use fake ID boxes. Usually reship on interception is left to the discretion of vendors, sometimes they offer interception / lost package insurance for an added cost, sometimes it is included in the cost and they let you know before hand, other times they have a policy of 50-50, other times they tell you to get fucked. At least that is how it has always been on private forums. I certainly don't think you are entitled to anything more than the vendor agreed to prior to making the deal though. Also care to give a general idea of the tracking notice? I don't want you to post the full tracking notice if you don't want to, but if it specifically says something about being intercepted or if you are just speculating due to it taking a long time to update would be nice to know, they used to straight up say when a package was intercepted but I figured they got smarter since I had heard of interceptions that didn't explicitly say it on tracking (but still gave it away) later on.

    ^ This. Its really up to the vendor as far as im aware. If his/her refund policy is posted on their profile, and he offers you less than stated SR might be able to help you, but its hard to say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry to hear your shit got taken. It pisses me off knowing that they are gonna throw that shit in an incinerator and burn it...What a waste!
    <br/>
    Not to mention the lost BTC out of your pocket.

    The tracking number had it stuck in customs for weeks and the vendor agreed it had most likely been seized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I bought the product his profile offered a 75-100% reship or refund policy. I assumed (perhaps naively) that meant I could claim a 75% refund but he says it is at his dircretion whether to offer a reship or refund, and is only offering a 75% reship or 40% refund. I didn't use my own address but had a reciever, but I still don't want to risk a reship- loosing money's bad but doesn't compare to getting caught by LE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers for the support anyway- knowing all those beautiful chemicals are going to waste is tragic!

    WOW! I just had my first " gone bad " shipment since I started here .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was sent to wrong zip although the addy on label was to correct zip and dcn was correct also.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I gave full refund.

    When in this biz the words "shit happens" are important to understand on both ends.

    Good to hear you came through Christy.
    <br/>
    We wonder were these lost shipments go?

    I'd rather not say where I'm at but my country isn't renowned for having tight customs. We shall see what happens...
