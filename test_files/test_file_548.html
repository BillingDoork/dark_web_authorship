    If somebody sent out priority mail thursday, would I get it saturday?

    We are both east coast and the seller seems to think it might make it. What do you think?

    You're both on the east cost? Yup, if they really sent it out today then it'll make it. I've sent packages across the country on Thursday and it always makes it on Saturday. That's the only thing I like about USPS is that they actually deliver stuff on Saturdays.

    On the other end of the spectrum, I've had stuff sent via priority half way across the country originating Saturday mid-morning, and received it on Monday!

    I would normally say yes but that is not always the case.Â  Some places way up in Maine and that area of the US may take an extra day depending on your shipping source location.

    Look it up on the USPS website. For me, because of where I'm located, it take 2 days coast-to-coast. But the extra day is, again, factored in depending on where its shipped from/where you are located. I just sent out an express envelope (non-SR related) and because of where the receiver is located it took an extra day - sucks, but upon checking their website it says to that location it would take an extra day. who knows? its a little bit of luck, but check out the site.
