    I had something sent last week from Eu to the us. I have used this vendor before and tracking. Now usually tracking it is accepted and sorted the same day. Then within 2 days its registered and then leaves customs there.
    <br/>
    Well it was accepted. Then a day later sorted. Now a week later tracking says it was registered and its been 3days since that. Still nothing saying it left customs as usually says nor says it arrived in us customs. I mean a week delay just to enter it into the system! Now nothing, Is anyone else having this trouble? i mean last 2 went like clockwork. As i said accepted and sorted same day and in 2 days registered and left customs there.  here we are almost 10 days later and its just been registered a couple days ago.  i mean come on this is crazy. I do not know to think if customs got it. OR if just slow because has been slow from the gate. I try to not track it much at all! i mean maybe once every other day. I did not even bother to try to track it over the weekend. So anyone have this similar issue? or advice? i mean 10 days just to sort and put in the system? i do not know what to think! The vendor thinks i should email them, but i am hesitant on that! do not want to make it look suspicious! but he says maybe they can tell me whats going on, I told him best to wait it out. so that is not really a question to me.
    <br/>
    My concern is there anyone else going threw the same issues or have previously? i mean i do not think eu has to have a warrant to  open so not like they were waiting for that customs can opean whatever. but it does not seem to be to customs yet, Its odd it always says registered and departs customs that same day, it never says arrived at customs there, just when comes to the us.
    <br/>
    So i am a bit worried, So, anyone everyone with any input, similar situations, advice,  i am open and hope to hear from my fellow community!
    <br/>
    we must stick together
    <br/>
    thank you all in advance!

    I have once had items, albeit not off the road, never receive an update in shipping from various points at customs until delivery or never even receive an update after entering customs.  This happens all the time.  I also once had a package sit in customs for over 3 weeks at which time it was updated and delivered according to their 3 week lack of update.

    Just make sure house is clean.
