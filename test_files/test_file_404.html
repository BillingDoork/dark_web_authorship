    I got a letter shipped from Quebec and it is coming too Ontario (1 province over). If it shipped monday night I assume it should be here wednesday? I got express.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My vendor has not sent me tracking number yet. My question is, when does mail usually come? I am done work at 3:00 if I check my P.O box at around 4:00 is it likely to be there?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could express 1 province over take longer than wednesday?

    It all depends on the carrier. If its usps, then usually overnight is guaranteed by 1pm sometimes 12n. Fedex and ups both have guaranteed time frames as well, (If you choose the early one, itsÂ  before 10 am if not, it can be there at 4 pm)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It depends. I would check out the website and that should give you a good estimate...

    I order a lot from QC to ON and it comes in 1 out 2 days from urban area to urban area. If you or the seller lives out of a major city center, expect up to 4 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for checking your mail, I have received Xpresspost packages later than my usual mail (same day), at 4-5pm. Since Xpress is priority, this could also happen to you, so I would suggest waiting til around 5:30-6:00 in case it comes a bit later.

    Thanks for the reply both.

    I live a 20 min drive out of Toronto.
    <br/>
    Not sure where my vendor is in QC. I am checking wednesday at 5:30-6:00.
