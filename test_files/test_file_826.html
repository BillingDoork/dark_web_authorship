    Has anyone ever shipped products to your work address? Would it be any different if I had sent it to my home/some other address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not home that often and it would be very convenient if this was safe.

    I've had a couple shipments sent to my office, and it worked just the same as shipping to my home address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some considerations:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.) How does mail come in? Would a letter/package be *guaranteed* to be sent to your desk, and not potentially be opened by a secretary/mail boy?
    <br/>
    2.) Would it threaten your job if you were caught with drugs there? In my office we specifically _do not_ have drug tests, and it's a more or less open secret I do a lot of drugs. If I were caught with a package of drugs here, I'd get a lecture about professionalism, but not fired. I doubt that's the case at a lot of other offices.
    <br/>
    3.) What about mail that comes in on a Saturday? Would you have access to it, or would you have to wait till Monday? Would someone with prying eyes or fingers have access to it over the weekend? (Security, maintenance, janitorial, etc...)
    <br/>
    4.) You're not only giving the vendor your real name, you're also giving them your place of work. I personally prefer to give them the bare minimum of personal information as I can
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aside from those considerations, I don't think there's much of a technical difference between getting mail at a business address vs. a residential address. I've noticed the mail comes to my office a lot earlier (about 10:00am) than it does at my house, but that's highly likely due to our mailman and not any sort of preference for a business.
