     New vendor DCN question

    Scenario:
    <br/>
    Got a package that is classified as a large letter (greater than 4" by 7" by 3/4").
    <br/>
    Has a DCN tag on with with the extra green label.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Do I have to leave the large green part on there?
    <br/>
    2. Can I just slap some more postage ($0.75 extra I believe)  and drop it in a blue box for usps?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, does checking DCN through a tor node flag anything?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First batch of customers and I'm excited to get this done, but I want it done right.

    1. you put the part of the green DCN that has the large bar code on it, the smaller half. this is the only part that has a peel off back sticker. put it on the front of the package. then you rip along the perforated line and keep the other half for your records.
    <br/>
    2. you need to add $0.85 cents worth of extra postage for the DCN.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NEVER check the DCN number through tor. Infact, dont even check it at all unless you need to. and dont check it from your IP address. either use a VPN based in the US or maybe a public wifi...

    Don't give out the DCNs so that you can control how/if they are checked. You only need the DCN in resolution so there is no benefit to sharing it with your customers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is an extra $0.75 of postage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would recommend checking the DCN via TOR + some kind of proxy... like a 3rd party package tracking website. I would only check them if the customer claims the shipment never arrived.

    Its 75 cents if it is a priority box or envelope . . .  85 cents for any other package.   They don't always know themselves, so many packages get delivered with inadequate postage.

    I think this would be one of the most risky aspects having USPS fish for your real IP and ID connecting the seller to a DCN number that a custermer will complain and make the Vendor check it......ect.....maybe it isn't really anonomous checking it................
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly if I were vending I would never check it............it you need it checked give it to SR Admin to check it for you.........if they wish

    Dude, there's already many sites that either flags or blocks Tor traffic.  You are the naive one thinking that USPS doesn't have the resource to do what many smaller sites have done.

    2 arguments here:
    <br/>
    FIRST: USPS doesn't have the resources to do shit. They're operating on a several BILLION+ dollar deficit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That aside.. the information here is both correct AND incorrect. YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY ONLY CHECK DCN INFORMATION THROUGH TOR. The catch? Well... you SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT check the DCN information via Tor using the USPS website.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are TONS of third party services that you can access via Tor and plug your information in to and get the same results.

    I agree that you shouldn't track a package through Tor BUT ONLY because it's better to be on the safe side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The truth is, there's not a single shred of evidence or a single piece of proof that a package on SR has ever been intercepted because of someone tracking it through Tor. There has never been one proven case of an SR buyer (or SR vendor for that matter) having their package flagged or being arrested because they checked their tracking/DCN# of their SR order through Tor on USPS's website. It's just a myth that was blown up and passed around the community.
