    Yes. Tracking with label 400 seems pretty useless. It's hit or miss. Some packs will get every little detail and then some will get none and some will get half of the updates.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had tracking on a package stop then the buyer finalized the next day so he received it but how come they stopped scanning it?

    It's bullshit. I hate USPS.

    Just a heads up...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its been said not to access USPS through TOR. There has been chatter that when TOR is used to access the USPS website, they may flag the shipment thats being tracked.

    My understanding is that this has not been confirmed or denied.. the bottom line though is that it would be VERY easy for them to track an IP address when you track a package and with the TOR exit nodes freely available, they COULD easily filter on IP's that are coming from the TOR browser and automatically flag those packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, just because they can doesn't mean they are..  there are a lot of other easy things LE could / should be doing but they are not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Additionally there are other sites that track USPS tracking but assuming that USPS IS tracking IP's, they could very well require the 3rd party site to capture and pass the IP address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The moral of the story here is why risk it? If you must check your tracking number then hop on wifi at starbucks, mcdonalds, or any other random unsecured network to track.

    In the private drug marketplaces we have unanimously agreed for six or seven years now that tracking packages through TOR gets them flagged.  We could be wrong though.

    Right on.  Thanks for clarifying that.  After re-reading my post it does seem a bit neutral to the subject and by all means the message was supposed to be "DON"T TRACK THROUGH TOR!"  I knew that it is HIGHLY likely and would be EXTREMELY easy for them to do this but hadn't seen anything definitive. Thanks!
