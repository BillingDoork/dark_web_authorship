    I placed an order 9 days ago, was marked in transit 4 days ago, seller sent message 2 days ago saying it was "sent last night" - so 2 days after he'd marked it sent. Wanted me to FE. Hasn't replied to any of my messages since. Has gone into stealth mode.
    <br/>
    Clearly he has gone rogue.
    <br/>
    I don't wanna have to wait another 7 days to resolve (making it 17 since playing order). I just want my funds back.
    <br/>
    How can I do this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ps it's domestic and i've never had an order take more than 2 days.

    So the vendor told you the package was sent and now you want your coins back as soon as possible? Sorry man, just wait it out. The package will probably arrive. It sounds like you are getting excited prematurely.

    Just wait it out a little longer.
    <br/>
    If the vendor says its been sent out, then thats all you can do is wait.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it doesnt show up within the normal amount of time it takes for the item you got to ship, then and only then should you resolve this issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't be to quick on hitting resolve, I've had my fair share of vendors taking ages to get a package out to me.
    <br/>
    So just relax, and be patient.
