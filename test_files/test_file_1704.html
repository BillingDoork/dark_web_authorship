    thinking about ordering 25gs of molly from PF. if shipped to america, what is the likelyhood of a controlled delivery if it was caught? doesnt seem like it would be enough but would like your input.

    cheers for the answer.

    delivery would be to a po box in my name while i am out of the country, which complicates things somewhat, hence why i am asking.

    What about a 24/7 PO box opened with complete fake credentials? If you order large amounts and wait 2-3 weeks and randomly  pick it up at say 5 am you really think LE will be outside waiting for you?

     it's very expensive to do manned surveillance that long but it's been done to vendors before so yes i actually agree with cacoethes there
     <br/>
     <br/>
     however even if they sit outside of the po box 24/7 waiting for you to come you can be protected, see http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30464.msg341229#msg341229

    I've only read one case of a vendor being under surveillance for that long and he was ordering kilos of mdma to the same box. I think these are rare cases and like you said it's VERY expensive to stake out a PO box for more than a week so you have to be a high valued target so if you were doing that much weight (kilos+) then I would go with another route.

    Depends on where you live, if you live in a small town that does not have many drugs and police find your ounce of high quality coke their probably goona wana catch you but if its in a big city with lots of drugs police will have bigger fish to fry and if they actually do catch you theirs not as much to brag about another factor is where you order to, if you order to a 24/7 PO box opened with a fake id their probably goona give up after a few days for anything worth less than $2000 for low class substances things like heroin could be different. If you order to you house than anything over $1000+ will most likely make the cops come after you since it will be an easy arrest.

    It probably depends on a number of different factors...  But they need not be hiding out and waiting for you in order to monitor and track where the package goes.  A simple tracking device could be employed...  Or cameras could be placed to gain useful intel such as make/model/license plate of your vehicle.  Surveillance need not be prohibitively expensive in order to be effective.

    Given sufficient quantity, I think the authorities would spare no expense in order to get their collar, but we're talking about the average Silk Road user, right?  Speaking only for myself, I really don't think I have the skills, much less the resources, to play cat and mouse games with federal authorities.  My solution is to make myself as small a target as possible, and hoping my small parcel of joy will blend in with the millions of others surrounding it.  Aside from those passive security measures, I keep a clean house and ensure that nothing else I do can link me to this particular online activity. Probably most SR users follow the same m.o.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A fraudulently obtained PO box does not help me with the above in any way; if I ever do get caught, it won't be because of where I had the goods shipped... but I think I'll be able to beat it in court, if it even goes to trial.  A hot PO box would only be a liability- additional evidence of wrongdoing, and additional charges, to boot.

     It probably depends on a number of different factors...  But they need not be hiding out and waiting for you in order to monitor and track where the package goes.  A simple tracking device could be employed...  Or cameras could be placed to gain useful intel such as make/model/license plate of your vehicle.  Surveillance need not be prohibitively expensive in order to be effective.

       it's very expensive to do manned surveillance that long but it's been done to vendors before so yes i actually agree with cacoethes there

       however even if they sit outside of the po box 24/7 waiting for you to come you can be protected, see http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30464.msg341229#msg341229

      I've only read one case of a vendor being under surveillance for that long and he was ordering kilos of mdma to the same box. I think these are rare cases and like you said it's VERY expensive to stake out a PO box for more than a week so you have to be a high valued target so if you were doing that much weight (kilos+) then I would go with another route.

     Given sufficient quantity, I think the authorities would spare no expense in order to get their collar, but we're talking about the average Silk Road user, right?  Speaking only for myself, I really don't think I have the skills, much less the resources, to play cat and mouse games with federal authorities.  My solution is to make myself as small a target as possible, and hoping my small parcel of joy will blend in with the millions of others surrounding it.  Aside from those passive security measures, I keep a clean house and ensure that nothing else I do can link me to this particular online activity. Probably most SR users follow the same m.o.

     A fraudulently obtained PO box does not help me with the above in any way; if I ever do get caught, it won't be because of where I had the goods shipped... but I think I'll be able to beat it in court, if it even goes to trial.  A hot PO box would only be a liability- additional evidence of wrongdoing, and additional charges, to boot.

    You make a good point about the PO box opened with fake credentials it would definitely be the last nail in your coffin when you have to explain it to a Judge in court on why you opened it with fake credentials and why contraband was sent to this box. I think for buyers a PO box should only be opened if they live with people that will open their packages but other than that there would be no point in opening a PO box at all. Dealers on the other hand (people buying in bulk) should really be careful and think outside of the box. I've heard about dealers doing all sorts of things from using private couriers to hiring people anonymously to reship packages or even hiring people to pick up the mail for them.
