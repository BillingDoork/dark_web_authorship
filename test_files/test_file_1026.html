    So, here in a few weeks. I'm gonna be headed off to alaska for several months of intense work at a fishery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    18 hours a day, no days off, lots and lots of overtime. ( Not even kidding, i'll be lucky to get 2 days off the entire time im up there )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, Im hoping to have some chronic mailed up to me, because i refuse to pay the local prices ( 500 - 600$ an ounce )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone know of a good vendor who has had success shipping product up to alaska?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know it can be done, im just hoping someone can point me to a good vendor, with relatively cheap prices and some decent smoke!

    Shipping to alaska is no different that the lower 48. Where did you hear prices are that high? You can get prime stuff for $300 and ounce in the matanuska valley.

    They aren't, but you also aren't flying straight to whatever place you are working. You will fly into anchorage and can pick up $300 ounces there. Even if you don't want to buy locally the shipping is no different here than in the states. No need for extra security. Enjoy the wonderful smells of fish.

    Meh, i dont know anyone in anchorage to pick up from. And on the island i was on, everyone i ran into was selling ounces for 300 - 500$ depending on quality. ( Some even asked for upwards of 800, but that was for ounce and a half of some super chronic )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But aside from that even if i wanted to pick up in anchorage, how am i suppose to bring it back to my island? i cant very well use the plane..
    <br/>
    I mean the superferry is an option, but after all is said and done i will have spent 400$ - 500$ on the trip alone, for ferry tickets + the weed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But i do like having that sense of " Fuck yea...my package is stealth as fuck right now, noone will find that shit..."

    Just PM'd it to you. Yeah I'm a little paranoid as of late lol so my bad. I worked in a processor and commerical fishing as well. Great money but yeah its a bitch. All my friends up there are commerical fisherman or work on a processor. And they are fiends for drugs up there, 1/8 of bud sells for $100 easy. PK prices are insane, and if you can get a hold of any "rare" drug such as psychedelics you can pretty much name your price.

    Also a lot easier to profile as the volume is lower.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember all those billions of dollars in high tech equipment that was distributed to local police and other government sectors right after 911? Remember all those crazy terrorist scenarios the media dreamed up?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lots of small and remote police departments got millions of dollars of equipment distributed to them. I wouldn't put it our of the realm of possibility for the USPS to have an x-ray scanner deployed in Alaska. Would get put to good use given the volume of mail. Could scan a good percentage of it.

    Any Alaskans here that could chime in on success rates? Particular international orders that go through customs in Anchorage?
