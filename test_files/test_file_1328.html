    I ordered from a vendor which I requested the package be sent via express shipping. It showed up the next day, however, when I went to my PO Box there was no slip in there saying the package is too big to fit. As I began to walk out the clerk from behind the counter said "PO Box ####?" I replied yes. He brought the package to the counter but said, "the signature was waived on this but I need you to sign for it". I refused, stating that to my understanding there is no reason for me to sign for it if the signature for the package has been waived. He then replied with a hard tone may I add, "you're expecting the package, correct?". I asked who it was from, when he told me who it was from I thought in my head, "that's a great return address (company, etc..)" - knowing the stealth of the package would be nothing short of excellent. I said I do believe that is the package but I'm not signing for it. The clerk then signed the pad himself and handed me the box...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was an incredibly awkward moment and for a few seconds I thought in my head - this is not worth going to jail for, walk away. The entire situation sketched me out beyond belief because I was literally in shock that I had to sign for it, but that could just be paranoia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you suggest I burn the PO Box? I have not sent anything else there and have since acquired multiple other drop locations.

    Not at all. It actually looked perfect which made me think it could have been opened and put in a new box (if inspected) - who would ever know?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't believe they would have enough time to do that though considering it showed up overnight.

    contact the vendor, ask him whats up..

    otherwise I'd be wary about ordering to that box, and consider burning it. better safe then sorry.

    Question -- in your best recollection, was the box indeed to large to fit in the PO box? If it was then maybe it's not something to be too worried about? If it would have fit in the box no problem, well then that is a little bit more strange.

    I do recall the package as too big to fit in the box, however, there was no slip stating so. The part that get's me the most is how he knew it was me and was walking to the counter with my package as I was shutting my PO Box (note, you can not see the box from the desk).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I approached the counter I asked, "did the mail just come or something?". He replied with, no this came around noon. It was now 4:15pm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing I could think of is that PO Box mail is delivered before 10am and this came in around noon so they were holding off until the next day to put it in the box.

    From my personal experience I can assure you this is perfectly normal. I have had the same thing happen to me, even on packages I didn't have to sign for - they would require a signature if it didn't fit in the box because you are picking it up from the counter personally. I have done this numerous times. Once a package wasn't in my box and it said it had been delivered on the tracking. I asked the man at the counter and he went and checked and found my package immediately, I walked out fine with all my drugs perfectly intact.

    alot of times PMB companies policy is to have u sign for any package that isnt regular first class letter mail. u obviously sketched the employees out so yeah i would drop it now due to your suspicious behavior.

    It's normal to have to write your box number number and sign the pad when getting priority and express mail across the counter.

    As Veenato said, that sort of thing is perfectly normal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've used PO boxes for years for my everyday mail and parcels, mostly because I travel frequently and it's easier to let a mailbox company hold my goods than to trust a neighbor or place a mail hold. Typically it only takes a few visits before the clerks recognize me and bring me my mail themselves - especially if the place is privately owned. The policies on signatures vary from location to location and manager to manager, but they're to be expected on orders that won't fit into your box: the package hasn't technically been delivered to you, and so your signature is needed so you can't later claim that they never gave it to you. (If you want to keep this from happening, spring for the larger box!)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still, if I were you I'd probably not go back to that drop. Even if the clerk wasn't initially suspicious, I'm sure your behavior tipped him off that something weird was going on. Why didn't you just tell him that you sprained your thumb, and could he sign for you? :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sure I'm not the first to have said this, but I'd really recommend anyone who opens a PO box for their orders spend a month or two ordering and picking up regular parcels at the place. You get a good sense of what's normal and what's not when it comes to package delivery at that particular location, plus visiting it will become a matter of routine rather than DON'T MIND ME I'M JUST PICKING UP CONTRABAND.  Even if you don't want to wait a few months to get a feel for the place, at least order a mountain of normal packages while you're waiting for the real payloads.  It definitely helps with the whole peace of mind thing.

    Actually I would advise that you DO go back and get it, and just chalk it up to having a rough day and forgetting your anxiety meds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What if your behavior tipped off the clerk, and right now they are only puzzled, yet in 10-15 days they still have the package and the clerk remembers back, and one thing leads to another and they open it...then what? Well if they find drugs then it is clearly linked to all the real information you provided to open the PO Box and now you are locally known by the post office and police to be receiving drugs/illicit packages in the mail...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or they could just send it back to the return address. This is what will likely happen.... but if it were me personally with my paranoid self, I would not risk them opening it up after a couple of days due to suspicious behavior you demonstrated. Though more or less, I doubt they will get a warrant to open your package just because you were acting weird. Just go pick it up dude.

    OP did receive it, yeah. He just needs to bail now because he WAS sketchy. (Although, to be honest, that does bring up a good point. Keep it for another month or so and then get rid of it... so it's not like you bail as soon as that happened).

    Just sign instead of acting so suspicious and refusing to sign. Huge red flag IMHO, the way you said you wouldn't sign. It makes it obvious that you know what's in the parcel, when signing doesn't involve any action on your part that you know what's in the package.

    A lot of these places will make you sign for any package that is not first class mail so they are not responsible for it being lost. Some places dont give a shit and will deliver to any box/any name and not care who you are as long as you give them the box number and say you are receiving a package. You overreacted. But for good reason I'm sure. I never pickup my own packages. This is why you pay a crackhead you know 20-40bux to setup the box/receive for you.

     I'm sure I'm not the first to have said this, but I'd really recommend anyone who opens a PO box for their orders spend a month or two ordering and picking up regular parcels at the place. You get a good sense of what's normal and what's not when it comes to package delivery at that particular location, plus visiting it will become a matter of routine rather than DON'T MIND ME I'M JUST PICKING UP CONTRABAND.  Even if you don't want to wait a few months to get a feel for the place, at least order a mountain of normal packages while you're waiting for the real payloads.  It definitely helps with the whole peace of mind thing.

    I totally agree with this .... I posted this in another thread and it def relates to this  topic as well and the OP should read this

    "I dont know why people are so stressed about having to go into the PO. I have a small box and my express never fit and so they always put a card in there so I just grab it and go to the counter and hand it to the lady and she hands me my letter.  I think people forget the best way to do something your not supposed to do is to act like your not doing anything wrong. Im very friendly and talkative with the ladys that work there and make a point to say more then just Hi and thanks.  I have nothing to hide, I get a lot of express packages but there are always other ones there to so its nothing odd. Ive already thought  of what I would say if I was ever asked(doubt it) or it seemed appropiate to say in a conversation.(also doubt it but maybee).  with the internet there are a lot of free lance small business type people that use the mail to and net to make money.  or theres also clubs you can join where you get cheap movies or music sent to you in the mail. or computer games, or stickers/decals etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dont think it makes any diff if you have to go in there since they know how many you get regardless whether they put it in your box or behind counter. to avoid them or act sketchy cause your soo fuckin nervous that they read it all over your face and body language.
    <br/>
    just act like a fuckin normal friendly outgoing person who is law abiding and a benifit to society. if people like you they wont think negatively of you"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will add that my PO never makes me sign for my packages that dont fit, I dont know if thats just how they do it or cause they know/like me

     Question -- in your best recollection, was the box indeed to large to fit in the PO box? If it was then maybe it's not something to be too worried about? If it would have fit in the box no problem, well then that is a little bit more strange.

    If the package is too large to fit inside the box sometimes they do ask you to sign for it if they need to keep it behind the counter. Usually they will ask for your ID as well.

    alot of stress coulda been saved if the op had asked about their policies when he opened the po box. like what if a box comes for me that dont fit in my box? then they woulda probably let u know that you would need to sign for it regardless upon picking it up and unless they know you like ur a regular they would need to verify that you are who you say u are and not just gettn someone elses mail. but understandably a stressful situation because it goes against what weve been taught about signing for packages so its kinda a double edged sword. just deal with professional people and that will cut the risk up fuck-ups along the way. and if your "spidey sences" are going off like u can really feel something is out of the ordinary or just not right, u coulda played it off better n just acted as if u had a phone call that u answer n walk outside n dip or wtf ever.
