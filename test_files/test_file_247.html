    If I had a domestic(USA) order that was intercepted with a VERY small amount of schedule IV's, would they send me a love letter, or just seize it without any notification given to me? They wouldn't try to convict me for a personal use quantity of a substance that isn't all that illegal would they? There is absolutely no way this or any of my previous orders could be considered to be an amount worthy of an intent charge...

    Looks like you pretty much answered your own question, but I'll reassure you a bit more.  Domestic packages are so much less likely to be intercepted than international ones, mainly because they don't go through customs.  Someone at the post office would have to consider the package suspicious enough to investigate, which is pretty unusual from what we've seen.  Considering that it's Schedule IV chemicals, I'd say the chances of you getting in trouble are extremely low.

    From the cases that I've heard about, only customs sends love letters. For very small amounts, domestic mail may seize the package and not say anything at all. For intermediate amounts, the cops might knock on your door and ask you about the package, but they won't wait around to do a controlled delivery (it's hard to do on regular mail because you don't have to sign for it and can let it sit in the mail box for days). As an example, I know someone who had 30 percocets mailed to him. I guess this is an "intermediate" amount of drugs. He used a fake name and when the cops came, he claimed it was a former roommate who got "weird packages" all the time, but the roommate had moved out days earlier and he didn't know how to contact the guy. Sure it was a bullshit story and the cops may have known it was a bullshit story, but they couldn't disprove him, and the amount of drugs wasn't worth further investigation. Now if it had been 500 percocets, yeah, they would have done a controlled delivery and waited for him to pick up the package, no matter how long that took.

    Ok, this is somewhat reassuring. I'm just concerned because I have a package that has been marked in transit for a while. Last time I got an order from the same vendor, it was here in 2 business days. its been like 4 or 5. So basically, if the vendor answers my message saying he shipped on Thursday, and its not here tomorrow, I should assume it was seized and find a new address....

    Dude give it time, after all it is the HOLIDAY time of year. Usually the postal system is generally a little slower in December due to it being around Christmas, and people are mailing a lot of things out/purchasing things from magazines, and etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe the vendor lied. (I'm not saying they did, but maybe they didn't ship out till a little later than they said, or the post office never shipped it out till the next day. I've had a package get sent to ship I was told it shipped. It was suppose to arrive the day I go to check if it's at my mailbox, I come to find out the post office never shipped it out yet, and shipped it out FROM the main location on the day it was suppose to arrive.)  USPS is slacking lately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are multiple reasons why it couldn't be there yet. Just relax!  You can't expect a package to arrive the same it always has that would be non sense. They make mistakes to sometimes.

    Relaxing isn't my forte. Being paranoid, however, is. I'm very VERY new to this too, so I guess I just have some minor delusions when small things go wrong.

    I'm sure most people were paranoid there first order or two.

    I was just trying to give you a peace of mind as to why the package couldn't be there yet. Like I said they do make mistakes from time to time.  It being the holiday season is definitely a big one.
