    Hey all, so recently I got a USPS Delivery Attempt Notice slip because I was not present during the delivery. I signed the slip and left it in the box, permitting the mail man to leave the package in front of my door, but here is where things get weird..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The mailman did not pick up that slip for 2 days now.
    <br/>
    The article number on the slip does not exist on the USPS database. The handwriting is also shitty too..
    <br/>
    I got a different parcel couple days after I got the delivery slip.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is also the option to call and reschedule since the mailman ain't doing his job. Has this happened to anyone before?

    Don't call them! Find a public wifi and fill out the redelivery form online. There's a notes section there. Write something like "Leave on the porch if no answer". Not sure if this will work without a proper tracking number. Don't forget to spoof your MAC address. If you call USPS, say goodbye to plausible deniability

    Registered? Are you sure this is your SR package and not something else?

    I am fairly certain it is from SR. I will definitely not call them anymore!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've heard of these slips getting red flagged in CO and people getting arrested as soon as they obtain their parcel from the post office. I've dealt with these slips before and the mailman ALWAYS picks them up when I put the completed slip in my box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At this point, I am 100% sure the package got flagged and LE is simply trying to lure me into their trap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the input. Goodbye precious goods.

    Hi dude,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If its a domestic package, and you didn't have to sign in the past or you were told you arent supposed to sign, then 100% do not attempt to retrieve the package. I think you realize this now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although signatures aren't always required for a controlled delivery, it sure helps prosecution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Contact your vendor... this is important and can cause him to lose a lot of orders and put a lot of people in harms way. He needs to change his return and packaging after something like this happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay safe!

    It is an international registered mail. The slip said it did not require signature. In the past this vendor never required signature, and he has not responded to my question for 3 days now.. I understand registered mail is important for preventing scams, but this is not worth it.

     Registered mail doesnt go thru the normal retarded postal workers and is transported in locked metal cages the entire time.

     Registered mail is how I get a lot of Intl mail that never gets effed with.
     <br/>
     If it where me I would proudly stroll into the PO and claim my shit especially if its registered, but thats just me.

    All domestic registered mail requires a signature. International registered mail, you have option of having no signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPDATE: Curiosity got me and I tried calling for re-delivery. Once again, I was told that the article number does not exist and my only option is to go in person and pick up the parcel from the post office. Has ANYONE experienced something like this before? If this is a setup, there is absolutely no way in hell I can walk away without repercussions....

    International does not always require signature, as explicitly stated by USPS.. something is not right with this situation and I'd rather be a fucking pussy than take the risk. I'm simply sharing my odd story; simmer down moon unit.
