    <br/>
    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    here's a recent experience we all can learn from or at least those that have been through their can hand-hold some of the new buyers through the same predicament that I am experiencing in the past 24 hours.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll copy and paste the message and you guys see if ya can help ease my buyers mind or better instruct him as to his rights, attitude and etc.:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUYER    Is there anyway you can do an hp of the blue dream?!"
    <br/>
    ========
    <br/>
    lucymcgee(100)    Hi just,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    because of the limited supply, I cannot list anything beyond a QP. If you order 2, then I will package them together.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lucy
    <br/>
    ==========
    <br/>
    lucymcgee(100)    Hi again Just,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I received both your orders and have them packed for tomorrow's delivery. :D
    <br/>
    ==============
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUYER   Thanks so much! Just wanted to make sure that they are going to the addresses that I put in the box when i ordered? They should be two differnt ones.
    <br/>
    ===================
    <br/>
    lucymcgee(100)    Hey just,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I sent them to the separate addresses as instructed. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sincerely,
    <br/>
    Lucy
    <br/>
    =======================
    <br/>
    BUYER    Is there anyway you could tell me when this order Transaction #61ed38e184 will be to me? I felt like it should have been here today?
    <br/>
    ========================
    <br/>
    lucymcgee(100)    Hi justfun,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll check it right now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lucy
    <br/>
    =========================
    <br/>
    BUYER    any reason why it would says devliary status not verified?
    <br/>
    =======================
    <br/>
    BUYER    if you could cancel any other shipments you sent and refund the bitcoins that would be amazing. Im a little scared right now that you package might have gotten intercepted. how did you ship it?    (THE PRODUCT HAD BEEN SHIPPED the day of, and IT WAS TOO LATE TO CANCEL)
    <br/>
    =====================
    <br/>
    BUYER   please respond? im worried
    <br/>
    ======================
    <br/>
    lucymcgee(100)    Hi Just,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your tracking # is:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    0312 0090 **** **** ****
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LucyMcgee
    <br/>
    ===========================
    <br/>
    lucymcgee(100)    Hi Justfun,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I went through your account and noticed your shipment of the product to a University? or some sort of residence hall and pobox? That seems quite risky my friend, but I recommend waiting out and ignoring the POBOX at the mean time. Remember, it is always "your right to remain silent." And you are only guilty if they can get you to admit guilt. Pretend to yourself that it must have been a prank, then you can get away with it. Be smart. You are innocent until proven guilty and there is no proof. It can be anything really. So, stick with this story. Tell this to the lawyer, and you don't have to speak to any authority. They can lie to you to get you to fess up. Threaten you with suspension and exile but that will never hold up in court. Just play it off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sincerely,
    <br/>
    Lucy
    <br/>
    ===========================
    <br/>
    BUYER     please ill let you keep as much btc as you need i just cant get another package delivered.
    <br/>
    ===========================
    <br/>
    BUYER    dammit! Is there any way that you could some how get my other order sent back to you? it was this transaction! Transaction #9200b90dd2
    <br/>
    =================
    <br/>
    lucymcgee(100)    Hi just,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are asking the wrong person for support with respect to these kind of matters. If recommend asking the people in the forum with a new topic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lucy
    <br/>
    ====================
    <br/>
    BUYER    so there is no way that you can call usps and have the package sent back to you?! Please!
    <br/>
    ====================
    <br/>
    lucymcgee(100)    I don't know if that is possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where exactly did you send it? To your school?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First thing first, you must know your rights!!! GOOGLE it, while I help you start a thread on the FORUM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sincerely,
    <br/>
    LucyMcgee
    <br/>
    ===================
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    WHAT WOULD YOU GUYS DO?

    I would say 100% there fault, they should know their risks and you have held up your part of the deal.

    Asking you to send it back to yourself would compromise your safety as a vendor, and quite a good tactic if he was police.

    As already said, you lived up to your end of the deal. Don't even attempt to have it sent back too you; that would really compromise your safety.
    <br/>

    That guy sounds like a complete idiot. Everyone ordering on here should be fully aware of the risks they are taking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for what i'd do; if the tracking shows delivered, i'd make sure and ask him to finalize the order. You'll be out of pocket if it doesn't get finalized.

    Agreed. You shipped to the address requested, your end of the deal has been taken care of. While sure I can feel a bit bad about a buyer if I allow myself, it sounds to me like they jumped the gun. They should have tested the address with a smaller amount instead of attempting to impress their dormates with a big bag of weed showing up at the door.

    I hope this kid gets around to reading your comments. A part of me wonders if he's a narc myself now that one of you mentioned it.  We all have made these kinds of errors, and I sure was an idiot myself in my hay-days.

    Am I wrong for getting some laughs out of the buyer's messages? I hope me makes out ok, I really do; But it's quite obvious he's not the type of guy who needs to be ordering HP's, regardless of where they are delivered. That's one of the problems here, IMO, too many people on SR who frankly shouldn't be. As a vendor, you did all you could.

    cultmadeline, while it was good of you to reassure your buyer and advise them on what to do if things go wrong rather than simply giving them the cold shoulder, did you seriously post their tracking number? Let's hope you edited it out before the post was crawled by Google. I'd be more worried about that than getting into hot water with my RA.

    Seems to me that the buyer did not give a reason for being paranoid. He only stated that the DCN didn't work, which as we all know, is very common.
    <br/>

    Tell him to take a chill pill and get his package when it arrives.  Man, people can freak out.

    NEWSFLASH UPDATE 10/21/2012:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) The Buyer Finalized his purchases. (PHEWWW)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) He did not respond to my invitation to join this discussion thread, nor did he respond to my second follow-up message to help him resolve his issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3) My assumption is that he left me 1/5 rating, on two purchases, and wrote "busted" and there were "cops involved."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's all speculations going forward, but I will update everyone as soon as he gets back to my third message... otherwise, I'll have to write it off as a messy transaction gone bad either by the feds or a rookie BUYER.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope we all gained something positive from this experience.
    <br/>

    Him asking to for you to somehow get it sent back to yourself raised the biggest red flag for me out of that entire conversation. I'd say that this was more likely a stupid cop than a stupid buyer. I'm sure we're all either near or at consensus that LE would be going primarily after the vendors and not the buyers, so anything that can even subtly compromise a vendor's identity/location (calling usps and asking them to return a large quantity of drugs to the sender is a step above subtle) and should be considered suspicious.

    When his "plan" to get you to take the package back failed, his final middle finger to you was to try to hurt your business by leaving a low rating and the warning. Ignore the pig trolls and keep on doing, safely, doing business!

    Cops spend cash all of the time to do drug transactions especially when they can get someone in person, a hand-to-hand drug transaction can be one of the easiest open and shut court cases and usually leaves the dealer with no chance but to plead guilty and hope for the best. I doubt this was LE though, you can't under estimate the stupidity of a lot of buyers on here.

    I dunno, the more I hear about stupid buyers, the more I think sr should be invite only. You gain invites by your purschase stats. Also here is an idea to help you out in the future, and I am really gald yall got your money, but I would recommend putting a transcation limit on that kind of wieght. like you must have certain amount of transcation before you can order this much, or you must have a vendor vouch. If some one took a risk on him all ready, from a trusted vendor of course. But in all seriousness, That was just flat out dumb to get that kinda of wieght sent to a college. But really its not yall guyes problem, because your right, you did your service, after its in the wind, what the fuck are yall suppose to do.

    damn what an ordeal, I was checking on my order and I noticed Lucy had some negative feedback regarding buyers being busted, my heart sank a little as I'm waiting on an order to arrive.. I just want to thank you Lucy for putting the link to the thread in your profile page, it cleared up the fear I had of packages being intercepted and just goes to show you not everyone is cut out for the road. It's a shame they left the feedback 1/5, but at least you have an explanation in your profile, it will definitely help clear that up. Keep chugging along, we'll get your stats back up there!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    gtrmonkey, I definitely agree with you, should be invite only, but at the same time, I'm a fairly new buyer and know nobody else who uses the road, so I wouldn't have been able to get access.. I'm definitely going to be a long time member over time, steadily racking those transactions up, and just loving the community here. I don't know, invite only has its pros and cons.. I'm part of some private torrent sites that are invite only and they work really well for weeding out the undesirables, at the same time though it's a bit harder for the community to grow. Lucy is a good example on how to deal with these bumps in the road.. The best canna vendor on the road in my humble opinion!

    Sir, only few words from me, your buyer is an idiot.

    How the fuck do you place an order and use an address which you clearly know you can't use for fuck knows what reason. I'm wondering if he's gonna get charged for stupidity when he gets busted.

    IMO the vendor did nothing wrong. There is nothing wrong with ordering to a university po box but NOT a half pound of weed! If you are going to order more than personal amounts of drugs you need to be set up with an anonymous delivery location or have some sort of plan.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think the vendor is under any obligation to refund money or intervene further, MAYBE refund just the upcharge so the vendor doesn't lose money (doesn't make money either) and they buyer gets something back, but again this would just be a VERY nice gesture on the vendors part. I would not expect a refund if it were me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its ridiculous for the vendor to try and get the package delivered back to himself, that is a HUGE risk and 1) if the package was intercepted they will not send it back to the vendor and 2) if it was not intercepted, asking for it back would raise suspicious, lead to more handling of the package and probably end up with the discovery of what is inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The buyer should not have ordered such a large quantity to a school address. Personal amounts are fine LE doesn't want to expend resources on some speed freak ordering a few grams of meth, but a drug dealer selling to college kids is probably worth the effort.

    Seems to me that this is most likely some wild eyed kid who found SR and thought he was a kid in a candy store. He bought, bought, bought with no regard for the reality of the situation...like a dumbass.  Reality has a way of hitting you in the face like a brick wall and then kicking you in the nuts while you're down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not to be an old man shouting "get off my lawn," but I see posts like this more and more from (probably young kids) on SR who learned just enough to make a purchase and then couldn't handle the reality of receiving contraband in the mail. I want it and I want it now, just send it to my parent's house...it'll all be OK.

    I vote LE. But one thing bothers me a bit. If it is LE can they buy drugs and not make a bust. They just bought 1/2lb. from lucy and 1/4lb.  HF with tax payer money and no way to to trace except the DCN. Which is pretty vague. I would think that would be illegal but i guess the USA govt. sold military rifles to the cartel in Mexico which were used to kill USA govt. troops so to speak. So i guess anything is possible

    So this "kid" did the exact same thing to another seller?  I smell a narc trolling for some easy felony busts -  that kind of weight is a 2-felony offense for both parties in all but eight states.

    I read this on Saturday and actually felt bad for the "kid" ... kid my ass ...

    Of course I'm speculating - isn't that what forums and message boards are for?  And don't you find it odd that the same buyer used the same spiel on two different sellers?  I found it odd &amp; that's what led to all the speculation on my part ~
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also,  I'm not trying to scare anyone, so if I did, I'm very sorry - really, I was just making a comment - I like to know what I'm getting myself into before I jump in with both feet.  Besides that, just so you know where I'm coming from,  one day I'm going to be a cannabis lawyer - the law interests me.  If we're not allowed to discuss the law here, I hope someone will be kind enough to point out my breach of etiquette.  Again - if I freaked anyone out I really am sorry.  [peace sign]

    one thing to consider is that he did it to both of us at the same time. what that may mean is that he was ordering from both of us at the same time and he really did get busted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think what happened is he got caught with weed and the cops wondered how the hell he got that dank into the state, searched his place and/or figured out it was from mail. he still had like 3 packs in transit from us at the time so in a panic tried to tell both of us to stop delivery. and then gave us bad feed back because of his mistake of getting caught...

    Thanks for the update &amp; for clearing this up.  Glad it's not a narc but I really did worry that if it really was a kid, and the kid really did get busted, that he had probably just totally screwed up his life.  Damn - a pound and a half.  Have to wonder where kids get that kind of money. (man that's a lotta dough)

    One other thing to note is that the kid finalized in reasonable timing.  I figured he'd hold the money hostage considering how quick and irrational he was with the negative feedbacks.
