    There are a bunch of threads on this topic but the majority of them seem to concern postal practices within the EU or items that have been shipped internationally.  In my situation, I've ordered from an extremely reputable vendor that I've ordered successfully from several times before.  We are both located in the USA.  This wasn't a particularly big order, and was the exact same size as my last one.  The shipping methods on the other packages were extremely similar and both of those packages were delivered, so I'm assuming there would be no problem with getting this one delivered.  In the meantime, I've had another order arrive at my place successfully, albeit from another vendor (but I have a suspicion that package was actually sent earlier).  So my question is this: Assuming the package was actually shipped and then either lost or intercepted, is it safe to use the same address within the USA again?  From reading posts on the forums, it doesn't seem like packages intercepted via USPS will earn you a love letter, but I'm not sure if that's actually true.  Does anyone know whether the USPS or any other LE agency "flag" addresses like this and then pay more attention to incoming packages?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm still working with the vendor to determine exactly what happened and I'm not entirely certain that the package won't arrive.  However, I'm a bit reluctant to agree to a re-shipment if the vendor (again, who is extremely reputable) actually sent the package and it didn't make it here.  Any thoughts/advice on whether or not I should stop receiving shipments at this address or how I should handle this situation?

    I had 2 international orders go missing and i waited at least a month after them to make any order at all. Got a few domestic orders successfully so decided to test international again. Ordered 2 lots of 5 tabs, 1 made it through, 1 didnt. I then made another international order a few weeks later that came through (very poor packaging). So it's really got me wondering whether shit got lost or confiscated, because if it got nabbed it doesn't seem like they have a very watchful eye on what comes my way.
    <br/>
    All orders were placed with very reputable vendors besides the last order which was a new vendors opening deal.

    I guess you just take the risk until you get a letter or a knock on the door.
