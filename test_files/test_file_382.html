    So I ordered something from Hydrofarm on Thursday morning, and the estimate I received for the package's arrival was two days. I received a package today, but something was off about it. The name on the envelope did not match the name I supplied, and the price of shipping listed on the package did not match the dollar amount I had paid for shipping in BTC. Still, it is the only mail I've received in days, so I assumed it must have been my order. I was going to follow the advice given to users to write "Return to Sender" on the package and wait a while before opening it, but I let my excitement get the best of me. I opened the package. What was inside was a DVD case without plastic covering of any kind; I assumed the product I'd actually ordered, which was most certainly NOT a DVD about skydiving, was within the case. It was not. It was not in the envelope anywhere either. I'm not sure why a DVD would arrive at the address I'd given as first class mail. The unfortunate thing is that, upon receiving the package, I jumped the gun on finalizing my order, so I'm at a loss as to what I should do.

    Does anyone have any experience with anything like this? Does anyone have any ideas at all?

    This may or may not help, but I suggest you go over your package with a fine tooth comb...I have received some very stealthy shit in packages I thought were total bunk.

    Nope. I quite literally tore the package and DVD case apart.

    Sounds to me like your package was being opened at customs, the illegal substance got found and eliminated and they thought that depriving you with a skydiving dvd is mean so they sent that at least.

    Interesting. Was the name a typo? Or a completely different name?

    <br/>
    Vendors do charge more than the actual shipping cost because they need to buy the supplies to hide your shit as well as shipping materials.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You did not specify if the amount was more or less than what you paid. If it was less that would also be strange.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did it look like your package was open?

    Slow down for a second and THINK before you act. Give us the important information, not vague generalizations.
