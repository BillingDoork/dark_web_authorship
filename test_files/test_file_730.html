    I doubt they would do anything that could give you a head start and not sending out your normal mail is arousing suspicions which is potentially giving you extra time to flush your stash, your good :)

    jfots8620, IMHO you do not need to worry - I get plenty of junk mail (you know, addressed to "resident" or "occupant", neither of which are my name). There have been times where even the crap that goes straight to the trash doesn't arrive - several (3-5 days in a row, in fact). LE would certainly let the suspicious packages come through - I believe isthereany need is correct in this, so you may relax &amp; rejoyce in the fact that earth's resources are not being wasted by sending out the latest Wal-mart or Costco fliers (think of the trees, thing of the CHILDREN! etc.etc)
