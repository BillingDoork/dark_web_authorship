    just got some bubble hash from canada sent to uk, side of the envelope was slit open and the hash inside the vac pack was clearly visible, really surprised no one took it, it was even market 1gram of bubble hash! think I'm very lucky there, must not have been a stoner who opened it! well I doubt it w a controlled delivery for a gram so time to relax and smoke the stuff 8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyone else still got an order even though it had been opened?

    I know of several people including myself who have received letters with the envelopes torn/cut open at one end with the contents almost visible from various EU countries to AU figured it must be the sorting office machines but still not good!!!

    Keeping you envelope and contents under xx grams, and pressing out all the air makes a huge difference.

    You should not try to put a 3d object in lettermail. For one thing lettermail is document only so any bump makes them open it to catch people trying to skip duty charged. Another is that that letter handling machines mangle anything that has a bump in it, they are meant for flat letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, if your stealth is good the letter could be opened and no drugs should be visible.
