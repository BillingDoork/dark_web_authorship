    Hey guys had two questions I wanted to ask
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) I heard some chatter that if you ordering internationally via usps or what ever if you have a "Business name" as opposed to a persons name being sent to a residential house it would get through customs faster. IE someone runs a business in there home like "Granny Panties Inc" and knits and sells  underwear from there home or some shit and gets mail addressed like that on the regular basis that usually in customs it will be less scrutinized etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Question 2) I heard that generally if you live in a major city or right outside of one and your ordering the customs and dea people wont waste there time doing a controlled delivery for any thing less than a kilo for Sched 3 1/2 kilo for sched 2 and 1/4 kilo for sched 1 given you never had a packaged seized and or given a letter before. This seems.....like idk far fetched any thoughts?

    I'm not sure about the first one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second might be true in some cities where the LE is too busy and under-budgeted.  For example, my friend got caught speeding in a big metropolitan area but the cop just told him to slow down and let him go.  If it was a suburban area, he would have walked away with a ticket.
