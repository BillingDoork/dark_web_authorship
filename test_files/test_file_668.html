    So, we all know whats up with USPS. Now, I would obviously still like to vend but am not going to the counter. So I will be offering my products without tracking and warning buyers that if it doesn't show, they are out of luck. I am just short of 20 transactions so I cannot FE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, say I send some shit... it doesn't show for any number of reasons... I will still get paid correct? The warning is on my page with full disclosure.

    It's not that cut and dry.  I'll just use myself as an example: 0% refunds, 0% autofinalize, and -- well... not a small amount spent, put it that way.  I've been buying for 6 months and I've had an issue or two, but came to a perfectly reasonable agreement every time and didn't need to bother anybody at SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So let's say I order from you, and it doesn't show up.  Sure, okay, it happens once out of every few hundred times.  Say the next guy orders, he gets it.  Great.  Guy after orders.  He doesn't get it.  Well now it's looking more like you, not the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Say it happens again.  Now they start siding with the buyer because looking at all the stats, it begins to seem like you scammed me (the first no show, I don't mean to be get personal here or anything), and are selectively scamming as you go along as part of your business plan.  They take all these things into account when the evidence is there.  You can't just say "if it doesn't show up, fuck you, I get paid."  That's what escrow's for, mate -- to make that decision for both you AND me, as it were.

    I'm with you about not travelling all the way to the counter. And I won't do tracking any longer. But I will trust my old-time repeat customers, and probably those with stellar buyer stats. Thise others with no so stellar reps, or for very large amounts, I will think long and hard, but, even though I hate teh idea, I guess it will be FE. With the proviso that I may have to do reships ocassionally, but I can live with that. My reputation is pretty stellar and I hope prospective buyers will trust me and understand if circumstances dictate FE.

    Numerous ways to get tracking? Using usps? How can this possibly be when there are only two tracking systems available, and one is now gone anyway (at least presticking it and dropping it off at a box; I know you can still buy DCN at the counter, but I will not do that)? Please, if you are in the know, couldn't you please reveal it, or at least give us a hint or two? I just don't see it.

    The new white USPS tracking stickers can be obtained from your local PO. They can be added to a package and then the package can be dropped in a blue-box.

    Tried to get the white slips at two different POs.  No luck. They wouldn't give them out.  Either they didn't have such an item to give out, or they were told not to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The main post office will print out the tracking label when paying for a priority mail at the counter.   If you go to a smaller branch PO (one at a grocery store, etc) they have a huge roll of the white slips, and they can't give them out either.  However, if you feel brave, you can bring your priority boxes pre-stamped in there, and they will just stick those on for you.   They didn't even look like the green ones, there was no piece you keep to have the number.  At the main PO you get the tracking on your receipt, and maybe the smaller ones will do the same, but they have to scan the tracking to get it there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Farmer.....   do the white slips you are talking about have a tab that you keep that has the information on it?   similar to the green ones?

    Sounds like you better figure something else out. If I were you I would not ship something without proof you at least shipped something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is to stop you from claiming you shipped when you didn't? Or what is to stop a buyer from pulling a scam on you? Especially a buyer with a long history of good feedback since you are a new vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are just asking for headaches.

    I had luck at 3/3 POs.
    <br/>
    They weren't in the lobby. They are on a roll (of 400 I believe) backed with wax paper. Each sticker has a small portion of sticker below it with a copy of the tracking number (for your records).
    <br/>
    I assume they are in the rolls so that the USPS counter workers can load them into their special dispensers.
    <br/>
    Maybe they will come out with another version for the lobby eventually?

      So, we all know whats up with USPS. Now, I would obviously still like to vend but am not going to the counter. So I will be offering my products without tracking and warning buyers that if it doesn't show, they are out of luck. I am just short of 20 transactions so I cannot FE.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So, say I send some shit... it doesn't show for any number of reasons... I will still get paid correct? The warning is on my page with full disclosure.
      <br/>

      Thanks for letting me know how this works

     Sounds like you better figure something else out. If I were you I would not ship something without proof you at least shipped something.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What is to stop you from claiming you shipped when you didn't? Or what is to stop a buyer from pulling a scam on you? Especially a buyer with a long history of good feedback since you are a new vendor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You are just asking for headaches.
