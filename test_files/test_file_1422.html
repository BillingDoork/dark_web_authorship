    I could really use some advice on shipping pills to the EU.
    <br/>
    Stuff like benzodiazepines was no problem. Perhaps it's too early to get anxious since some EU vendors say it can arrive after shipping as soon as 2-5 days, or as long as 3-5 weeks.
    <br/>
    The benzodiazepines always arrived within the 2-5 day timeframe. And now our xtc has not arrived to several countries about one week after shipping.
    <br/>
    I have increased the packages by looking less suspicious but had better luck with more suspicious looking ones in the past.
    <br/>
    Did customs improve since 2013 or something?
    <br/>
    Is it normal that they do not send letters anymore? Would I be scammed by shipping to people with fairly new accounts? But then also by buyers with some perfect stats. That would seem odd.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since these are pills it's a risk to put them in normal letters since they might be crushed in those flattening machines they get.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some advice/stories on how EU vendors ship their more illegal than valium pills would be great. As well as their experience with shipping-arrival distance in time and if there is a differences for different countries I would appreciate hearing about that as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some vendors do not ship to the UK anymore. Why?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By PM ofcourse so this will not become a topic where LE gets the chance to gather intel.
