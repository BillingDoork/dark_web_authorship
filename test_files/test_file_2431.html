    please calculate the correct postage for your package and letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing screams, FAKE BUSINESS LETTER more to LE than a letter having shit loads of stamps on it, more than is absolutely required.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Especially when your fake business return address is an association or small company.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I run a small company, I send shit loads of post. I don't pay more than I have too, these are tight times, businesses control costs. The letter I received today had, excellent packaging, great return address but 5 fucking first class stamps! That is three quid of postage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The letter was standard size and weighted in at 70 grams., postage to my country should have been only 2 pounds. It might not sound a lot to you, but I guarantee that no business in its right mind will pay 1/3 more than they have to.
    <br/>

    You know just saying....Â  ::)

    110% agree with you on this. What idiot doesn't take the time to understand how much shipping costs to how much your stamps are worth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's so simple, yet people are so lazy.. what a shame.

    I agree too. I mean i know vendors are in a hurry some times and want to get out product and make sure it makes it. we do want our pack asap. but on the other hand. rather have it a day later and come proper packed and proper postage!
    <br/>
    big thumbs up on that!!
