    I received a package of a small amount of powder recently, but when I got it, it looked like the envelope has been opened and then partially resealed, and a quarter gram or so of the powder was missing. The package didn't have tracking on it, and I suspect that a postal worker opened it and stole some. All tracked packages are getting through fine without an issue, but I've had one or two untracked packages go missing in the past month.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again?

    Sounds like a postal worker that needs to learn to mind their biz, open up a PO box and check the vendor reviews to see if this is a common issue with the vendor.

    Verify with your vendor(s) before ordering that they're willing / able to ship only *with* tracking?  Given the circumstances you describe, that seems like a reasonably straightforward solution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Failing that, you could arrange to have a non-tracked, fake package sent to yourself containing a note to the postal worker advising that you know what they're up to.  If opened, that might "scare them straight", so to speak, but at the possible risk of getting your name put on a list of cranks (or worse).

    Seems a bit odd really, why wouldn't he just take the lot?
    <br/>
    A postie robbing powders would be a bit weird too seeing as he'd have no idea what it was. Lot more likely with weed

    Not trying to sling mid, but is it possible that the vendor's packaging was that poor to begin with? The missing product could have been lost due to the packaging, or not there from the start? If I was a postal worker going to steal something I would take the whole thing, I mean why seal it back up and send it on? What does that achieve?
