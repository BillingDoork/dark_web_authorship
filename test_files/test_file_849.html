    Information about Australian Customs and Border Protection. (Links Below)
    <br/>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All this information is freely available online, I'm just compiling some of it here for those that may not know about it, it's a good idea to stay updated with their new methods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most vendors who ship to Australia should benefit from reading most of this information, there's a lot of interesting facts :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From their Freedom of Information page... "You also have a right to ask for information that Customs and Border Protection holds about you to be amended if it is incomplete, out of date, incorrect or misleading."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AusPost Addressing Guidelines: (see link below for more detail, applies for international mail also)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Typically, the address should be written in three lines:
    <br/>
    - The top line should contain the recipient's name
    <br/>
    - The second to last line should contain the number and name of the street, PO Box or locked bag number (if applicable)
    <br/>
    - The last line should contain the place name (suburb, town etc.) or post office of delivery, state or territory abbreviation and postcode.
    <br/>
    (This line should be printed in capitals without punctuation or underlining, with the postcode put last)
    <br/>
    - For international mail, the country name should be in capitals on the bottom (fourth) line
    <br/>
    - Use the correct postcode (you can use ourÂ  tool to do this)
    <br/>
    - Print clearly using dark ink; preferably black on white. Avoid using red, yellow or orange ink
    <br/>
    - Don't indent or stagger address lines
    <br/>
    - Don't underline any words
    <br/>
    - Include a return address so we can we can return the letter if it can't be delivered. Put your address in the top left corner,
    <br/>
    or on the back flap of the envelope
    <br/>
    - For machine-addressed envelopes, we recommend using clear readable type such as Courier 12 point or 10 pitch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AusPost Packaging hints &amp; tips:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make sure your item arrives safely, it is your responsibility to ensure your item is securely wrapped, with enough cushioning to prevent damage to the item, postal equipment or other mail, or injury to people handling the item. If your item is fragile, perishable, crushable, oddly shaped, or sharp, you should take extra precautions. Liquid, liquefiable or powder articles should also be packed securely.
    <br/>
    All packed articles should withstand a drop of approximately 1 metre to prevent potential damage or breakage. You can buy padded bags and other secure packaging online or at any Australia Post retail outlet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fragile items (e.g. glass)
    <br/>
    - Wrap each item in tissue paper or newspaper
    <br/>
    - Put them into an inner container and put the inner container into a corrugated cardboard outer container
    <br/>
    - Surround the inner container with cushioning material such as bubble wrap on the top, bottom and all sides to limit movement and protect the item
    <br/>
    - Close the outer container with reinforced tape
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perishable items (e.g. fruit)
    <br/>
    - Place items in paper mache trays
    <br/>
    - Put the trays in a heavy cardboard outer container lined with absorbent slabs
    <br/>
    - Enclose the address and return address, and then seal the container with reinforced tape
    <br/>
    - Put the address, return address and the word 'PERISHABLE' on the top and on one side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Crushable items (eg. drawings and photos)
    <br/>
    - Protect the front and back of the frame with strong, rigid material larger than the frame to minimise chances of breakage
    <br/>
    - Place soft, protective material such as bubble wrap between the frame and the rigid material to reduce pressure on the glass
    <br/>
    - Put the item in a box in a heavy cardboard outer container
    <br/>
    - Enclose the address and return address, and then seal the container with reinforced tape
    <br/>
    - Mark the item as 'FRAGILE' on the outer packaging with the address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sharp items (e.g. garden shears)
    <br/>
    - Tightly roll newspaper around the blades and secure with reinforced tape. The newspaper should extend about 100 millimetres beyond the tip
    <br/>
    - Put the address and return address on a slip of paper, and then tape it to the item
    <br/>
    - Place the item in a corrugated cardboard outer container and surround the item with cushioning material such as bubble wrap to limit movement
    <br/>
    and protect the item
    <br/>
    - Tape all seams and wrap the item tightly with reinforced tape.

    Great info for Vendors interested in servicing customers in Australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well done +1 for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would recommend all vendors to read the first sticky ' Stealth that works...' and implement Moisture Barrier Bags as a matter of priority. Vac seal for overseas orders are not secure. .....no matter how many times....and potentially put your customers in legal jeopardy.

    I know it isn't top secret info or anything, but i thought that posting the links would be better than not posting them...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If customs and le are going to spy on us, then we should spy on them.

    Great work finding this!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most of this info relates to their Cargo Examination Facilities which handle shipping containers so can be handy for those sending larger packages through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Knowledge is definitely power so the more we can find/share the better a position we'll be in.

    Great info fallkniven +1
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am very pleased to see the surge in members researching the FACTS and posting informative accurate information recently, it is helping to dispel the FUD myths that get banded about on the forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Knowledge is power and we are collectively working to counter the efforts of customs now in a big way, I bet it is really starting to piss them off which puts a big smile on my face.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can research this same type of information for standard mail that would be a great addition to the stealth sticky.
