    I'm not sure about the rest of you, but I get the feeling that the changes surrounding the new Tracking Numbers reeks of them trying to seek out vendors.  The only people who are going to have stamps and their own tracking info without buying their discounted postage...??  They are making it SUPER difficult to get them (all of the post offices are claiming they haven't got any or are being super stingy about them.  Then, it's like they want to force you to order some online - which I did, which I now regret.  What if they can track all of the same tracking numbers all the way back to who ordered them online?  I don't want to be on camera,  I don't want to use a credit card, but I definitely don't want my package to be traced straight to my address.  I wish I could trade them out somehow.  Anyone else seeing a problem with any of this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT 04/16:  If you need tracking numbers, either go to PO's and ask for them until they give you some or order some from USPS.com to an alternate address (it takes 2 weeks, no credit card necessary).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!  We are discussing the ability to order postage from Stamps.com - can we use prepaid credit cards?  Can we use alternate addresses?  Can we use public wi-fi or VPN?  Anyone have any experience in this area - we need your help!!!

    Man, I was at a post office today, buying a few stamps with cash. I decided to ask the lady helping me if she knew anything about the Label 400 tracking stickers, explaining how I ordered some online but they never sent them to me (that was with a fake account to a friends house, so I was bummed they were a no show). So this lady goes to check on some priority stamps, and while she's gone I see some Label 400's on a back shelf. She came back and told me they don't have them here, that you have to order them online. I was real close to calling her out and pointing on that shelf behind her, but I didn't want to make a scene. They already hassle you just for buying stamps. She's like "Why don't you do all this online?" Basically I feel like I'm being profiled when I go in there.

    If you're spending $100s a day on stamps and/or express mail, you're one of their best customers... Demand an answer and a response from a manager of the PO... assuming you don't need to go back :)

    The last 15 threads ive read about this suggested either ordering them online and having them sent to your door or sweet talking the clerk out of a roll. The only other solution ive seen on here are vendors selling rolls of em  that they ordered online, except that the only people buying them are vendors themselves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You got any better ideas? You cant order them online without it coming back to you, and clerks have no incentive to break the rules and give them out. On top of that you have to pay additional postage for tracking on stamped mail, so its still unclear even if you did get your hands on them if additional stamps would work.

    I have MULTIPLE ways to get them. I will never go into detail on how you do this, though I might sell the ways one day. And yes the additional payment can be made with stamps. You are wrong though, some don't require extra depending on how you run your shipping.

    Yeah, you go up to the counter and pay for flat rate postage, tracking is included. This might work for vendors out in the boonies where they dont have security cameras, alot of vendors dont got this method. Only other way of getting these rolls is to have a friend get em and they play stupid (sorry boss someone swiped em off my desk). Either way this whole process is now a pain, more than it ever was.

    I was told that tracking cost $0.90 extra for Priority flat-rate boxes if you use stamps and drop in a blue box. It is free otherwise. This info does not seem correct to me and I have not seen proof of it yet. Anyone know for sure?

    Can you direct me to a place these rules/prices are shown. USPS.com does not seem to have the details where I have been able to see/find them. I want to be armed with the facts next time I run into the USPS gal that seems to know it all.

    Basically what BV said... think about and get creative.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But vendors ordering rolls of labels from other vendors is questionable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your freedom and freedom of others is on line so spend more time researching. New tracking is partially setup to finer compartmentalize tracking. The risk comes when you get a seizure or an investigation. They can pull up every package sent with your 'batch' of labels. So if you order 100 online, all 100 of those WILL be linked together, and linked to your order. Certain shippers have unique shipper #s that will be in all tracking #s ever issued to/from them. Kind of like a UPS tracking #.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People here too paranoid about some things however and distract from clear thinking. This small area of world is such a SMALL % of total mail in the system. If SR is 0.01% of total mail that would be very surprising. Thinking everybody is looking at your pack and KNOWS its a SR pack is clouding judgements here sometimes. Poster last week was going crazy because receive tuna can also in his pack. Hahaha... watch out for super scan x-ray that see tuna can and auto match to SR pack.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Healthy paranoia and intelligent design is good. New tracking is one place to be more paranoid. They introduce system wide abilities to track better, add finer tracking control (even to 1st class mail), and more important to search catalog link and keep data. They not do this for SR, they do to increase efficiency #1, make more profit, run better operation. Also LE influence some changes, yes, but for terrorism, for scams, many other crimes, and yes maybe SR little bit too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think. Relax. Research. Be smart.

      I'm not sure about the rest of you, but I get the feeling that the changes surrounding the new Tracking Numbers reeks of them trying to seek out vendors.  The only people who are going to have stamps and their own tracking info without buying their discounted postage...??  They are making it SUPER difficult to get them (all of the post offices are claiming they haven't got any or are being super stingy about them.  Then, it's like they want to force you to order some online - which I did, which I now regret.  What if they can track all of the same tracking numbers all the way back to who ordered them online?  I don't want to be on camera,  I don't want to use a credit card, but I definitely don't want my package to be traced straight to my address.  I wish I could trade them out somehow.  Anyone else seeing a problem with any of this?

    Considering the fact that I have not spoken to anyone about methods used makes me chuckle that you could just simply "guess" the way BV is doing it as if I am some sort of seer. I only commented to mess with vendors that are too lazy to think of ways to get these labels. They are EASY to get. Like it's almost easier now then before the changes honestly.

     If it's so easy then why wouldn't I be able to guess?  You posted enough about it here in this thread that I can tell how you are doing it.  There are only so many ways to get a tracking number so it's not hard to guess the way you were talking about in this thread.  And no it's not easier after they stopped leaving them on the counter.  That made it harder to get them anonymously because before, I could go to a post office after hours and get a whole stack.

    I am nervous about all the USPS staff with false info about needing to take packages to the counter for tracking. Even if they are wrong, they may have the power to "return to sender" my packages (for not including the extra $0.90 postage I was told was required for tracking if dropped in a blue box with stamps). I guess if the rules were clear and easy to find the staff could know them. I have not seen the rules they follow yet. Maybe I should just add another $0.90 in stamps to be sure but over stamping is a flag, lol.

    You don't have to pay an extra $0.90 for tracking.  You might have to pay an extra $0.90 for not paying online with your credit card.

    Most of it is they don't know better. Like to make their own rules up to feel important. Or the way they want it so that how they say it. The real 'rules' are very easy to find and as all things gov it is about 200 pages and spells out very clear if you want to read it.

    <br/>
    @BV - ones that know your method or similar are not here on forum asking. partial correct then ;)

    Not secret handshake business here - ez problem, get track label and no get trace back to you. now think of ways to do this o)

    Well - I don't know if you can access stamps.com via Tor - but that sounds like a pretty good idea if you can.  Otherwise, I ordered USPS Tracking stickers from USPS.com to a friend's address, at the same time I ordered some Priority flat rate envelopes.  She got the envelops about a week and a half ago, but no stickers. I thought they screwed up and forgot the them, but I got a call from my friend that they were delivered yesterday in the mail.  I think there must've been a shortage of stickers to begin with, but the post office I buy my stamps from gave me a couple books of tracking stickers finally the other day.  When I originally ordered the stickers (4/4) I told my post office (located inside another business)  that I would split my stickers with them (that was before they gave me my stickers) so - I think I'm going to give half of my ordered stickers to the post office, just in case the USPS decided that they can 'trace' my tracking stickers back to the order I placed online - I just don't want to put my friend through having agents at her door.  Giving the PO half of them should throw them off a little bit - lol...   How paranoid we vendors are - but at this point, I can avoid going in at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OnlyIn2K12 -- let us know if you try to open the stamps.com account via Tor - if that works, I'd be super down to go buy stamps via the internet - would save me a TON of hassle, but my paranoid alarms just keep going off thinking about it.

    What about like a prepaid pre-valued non-reloadable card from Wal-Mart or whatever??  USPS sells AmEx prepaid cards.  Plus, stamps.com is going to want an address because they send a 'postage scale' when you sign up.  I think if it were easy to get working, then a lot of vendors would have already recommended it - highly.

    I checked into those cards and the problem is not buying them without ID but finding a place where you can use them anonymously. Most online businesses will not take them as payment unless they are tied to an address with SSN.

    Maybe someone else has figured it all out but I haven't found one I feel comfortable using yet. Maybe some offshore card?

    I guess I could just make a trip to the local post office to see what the scoop is but does anyone know if you can just walk into the post office buy a bunch of pre-paid envelopes, pay cash and not divulge any personal information?  I mean, what criteria would they require?  Fuck, I'll wear my fake mustach, Fedora hat and some make up, totally walk in incognito.  :)  These envelopes would only be for domestic shipping in the US.

    Rather than order tracking slips form Tor, I'm thinking laptop at a public Wifi hotspot.

    I have not tried it and don't know if that transmits personal info about your laptop or whatever? How to pay and where to ship still a challenge.

    PacMan, if you ask enough postal employees nicely you can usually get some of the new white labels. They come on pads and rolls. I recently had a new gal (new to me, she seemed to be very knowledgeable though, of course) start out saying "they did not have tracking labels anymore". I try to be nice, but could not resist telling her I knew that was untrue. She eventually admitted they had them in a box in back and that they were not sure what they were supposed to do with them. I told her they could be ordered online but that I did not want to go to the bother of that. She claimed she read an email that seemed to suggest that they not give them out and that I should order them online. I could not really question her more thoroughly.

    Tracking slips are free through USPS.com - so you don't need Tor - it doesn't ask for a credit card - all you need is an alternate address to send it to.  Takes about 2 weeks to receive.  They come in packs of 25 (2 per slip) and you can order up to 4 packs (200 total tracking numbers).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, like NW Nugz said - you can try to get them from the PO directly - but that's why I started this thread - because (especially a few weeks back) it was like pulling teeth to even get them to admit that they had any, let alone get them to give me some.  I thought at first it was some kind of new policy that was being used to help track down people who were actively trying to avoid the post office (SR Vendors), but in hindsight - I personally think there was just some kind of shortage and the PO didn't want to be giving out huge amounts of them leaving them fucked in the event they needed them (the PO I go to isn't actually a primary location, it is located within another business - so they don't have the PO computers that can print up tracking number labels - they HAVE to use the stickers and actually at one point ran out).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for stamps.com - I think that is a no-go - if it were possible to use without being traced, it would be the primary source for shipping on SR due to the fact that you could avoid the PO altogether and its cheaper online than IRL - I just think there are too many ways to get tracked (IP addresses, credit card #'s, etc...) - but due to that fear, maybe nobody has actually vetted the process thoroughly.  Has anyone searched the forums to see if anyone else has tried stamps.com?  That's probably the next step in our search - see if anyone else tried to vet it.

    I don't know if the usps got a new supply of labels, or if I found the one postal dude who cares, but I scored a handful of tracking labels the other day. Was buying 10 Priority stamps, and the guy reaches for a roll and says "Do you know about these?" In my mind, I'm thinking 'Yeah, I've been eyeing them since I stepped up to the counter, wondering if I should bother asking for them.' But I say instead "Wow, I had no idea. I'd given up on tracking."  ;)
    <br/>
    Well, he gave me 10 labels for the 10 stamps, and even explained how to use the labels. Super nice guy, kinda blew me away.
    <br/>
    Anyway, just wanted to share my newest experience. It gave me hope, although it only gave me 1o labels... Peace!

    That's nice of him - I think the consensus is that the USPS is loosening up restrictions on the pads of tracking numbers.  I guess I should change the title of the thread - our new obstacle we're discussing is the ability to order postage online (via stamps.com for example) - in our voyage to avoid being on camera...  and doing all of this without committing fraud (tsk tsk mephfreak...).
    <br/>

    Let's get this conversation started officially!!

    Problem, we say before also, is any label order online WHOLE batch is tied to your order. If one package taken, they can see ALL packages sent with that batch and know what unused track labels still there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, they make sure that they need to send you something when order stamps.com account or other service. every account your setup needs a drop address to get this every time. and all packages ever sent with that account all tied together again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if vendor send out many packages will have to make many new drop, new CC, new account will make tired. :D
