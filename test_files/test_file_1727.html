    Lol he's kind enough to tell you its at your own risk.
    <br/>
    Maybe you don't realize that say for international parcels if I want to send something from Canada to Aus the cheapest method with tracking is $80 and takes 3-4 weeks.
    <br/>
    OR you can ship via small packet air which is only $10 and takes 10-18days...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I always include a tracking option in my listing incase someone wants to pay for it but unless you are going to reimburse the seller for shipping don't expect it.

    ^^^^^^^^^^  THIS
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I told someone just the other day "This isn't fucking amazon.com" :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have any question in your mind about the legitimacy of a vendor, don't buy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything you buy on here is at your own risk.   What's with guarantees?  There is an escrow system and feedback.  Use it, and don't be stupid.   We almost never ship with tracking.  Why?  It can be tracked!  Do you seriously want your drugs to be tracked?  You want a digital copy of a record that a package was sent to you for all to see until the end of time?

    Not for nothing, but aside from this not being Amazon, more often than not sending something international with tracking will require a signature upon delivery, which is something you want to avoid at all cost
