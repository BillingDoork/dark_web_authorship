    This could have the makings of a good Futurama episode.  The professor invents a device to download physical drugs from the internet and each member of the crew gets hung up on a different drug and various antics ensue.  He has that teleporter ray gun already so it probably wouldn't take much for him to modify it to work over the internet.

    The idea is loverly, teleportation of solid matter. Only a coupla issues as I sees 'em right now. Firstly, the original is destroyed when getting "scanned" prior to reassembly.So no infinite potatoes.  Secondly, your meth got in my heroin, blammo...super powers granted immediately. Not that that would be an issue, but it is worth considering.

    So you're telling me not only that I should consider getting super powers, but also that meth and heroin combined gives you super powers? I'll get right on that.

    Old news.  You need a very expensive printer (more than $10,000 USD) unless you don't mind losing fingers.  It is a small .38 good for one shot.

    Virtual reality will probably become a reality before printing drugs does. How would you get real lsd from a 3D printer anyway? But I can totally invision merging computers and mind, then you won't have to download the drug, just click the button labled LSD and you're done.

    You should read about it.  It's very interesting.  The ink is like precursors and printing is like performing the synthesis.  It's really not that far in the future.

      You need a very expensive printer (more than $10,000 USD) unless you don't mind losing fingers.  It is a small .38 good for one shot.

    2 pages and no mention of Binaural Audio? Wow lol. - I think it is effective froma therapeutic standpoint but not to get high.

    Also a drug printed would simply be an automated lab that uses precursors, solvents and intermediaries to produce your desired product. Expect the machine to be like the big as fuck xerox machine in your office, and make sure you have many B class fire extinguishers around.
