    I am sure that you have sent the vendor a note or is this order been placed awhile ago.   I almost lost an order the same way recently but the vendor read my second note before shipping. Hope its not a huge order has it been marked in transit?

    Yeah, it shipped out a few days ago. Its too late for a correction. My only hope now is that maybe a vendor noticed and corrected it, or that it somehow makes it...

    I guess you'll just have to wait and see, but I do think the postal service realizes there is no country and can from their records of zip-codes and cities figure out the country of residence.

    I have to say that I disagree with you there that the vendor is at fault for not noticing the address without the country on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors have enough to be doing, with packaging, answering PMs, sourcing new stock, sourcing stationary, staying safe, dropping off packages etc, without having to go looking up addresses to make sure the customer has their one correct. You should always double check, treble check and if needs be, quadruple check the address your giving before you place the order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I always final check it just as I am about to click the 'OK' button when I am encrypting it.

    I check my address many times too, in fact I think most of the fault belongs to the buyer in this case.
    <br/>
    But on the other side, even if a vendor is usually very busy, it would've required a very little attention to notice the country was missing.

    I'm not from the US but I know every name of every US state (and no, I haven't studied them) and to me it'd be so evident the lack of that part.

    We are asked to provide a shipping address, it is covered in a sticky somewhere to ensure the best shipping practices it also states to use the proper format that the post office wants so as not to have any flags raised. For domestic they do not want the country included so it should not stand out if it was missing. I would guess a vendor cuts and pastes the address for printing so he shipped it were the buyer told him to.  Hope  your package gets to you The vendor might of noticed that it was getting shipped to the States but I wouldn't hold my breath if they are a busy vendor. hope it wasn't a large order!

    The post will do everything to have the package delivered which means they will have to basicly figure it out and they should be abel to, It is their job.   I hope the return addy is not yours.
    <br/>
    How do you know you forgot to put down the country?  where there any numbers (zip code)   I hope they get it and for both partys I hope it was a small order.  Keep us updated.
    <br/>
    Its always good practice to check it 20 :P times befor heading out,   Good luck with that though,    No your not realy fucked so calm down. whats the worst thing thats gonnna happen? youll get a 1, woopty doo, that dosent mean your fucked, you just learn from your mistakes. With that being said, remind me not to buy anything from you, you might forget my zip code :P Just kidden

    Had this happen to me.   Got two packs from a NL vendor that shipped them to the US using his UK remailer.   The remailer put UK instead of USA on both packs (mailed a week apart).  It was totally their  fault.   First pack arrived about 3 weeks later (about 1.5 weeks late).  It was rerouted a few times.  The second pack showed up 5 weeks or so later.   I was suprised I even got it.

    I forgot to put the country when I ordered from boymaster in spain but he fixed it on his own without contacting him about it. I imagine most vendors want their packages to arrive so they are probably alert to where they are sending and will most likely notice a mistake like that before they ship. But there's no guaranteeing that they will.

    I usually never put the country when making an order and I always get my stuff fine, I think it has to do with the zip code since they're usually different depending on the country.
