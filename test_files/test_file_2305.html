    I am wondering if anyone knows what the protocol is if your package is intercepted and deemed to contain contraband?  Do you get a letter, a warning, do they put your address on a "watch list",  do they arrest you?

    Depends on what is in it.  Make your hypothetical a little more detailed.  Pound of weed for instances?  Pretty sure they would send an employee of the postal inspector to do a controlled delivery and they have the cops serve a warrant a few minutes after you accept delivery.  That is why people say not to open your package right away.  I actually set mine right by the door as if I am going to take it to the post office like I didn't have any package coming from where it came from.  Also, don't sign for a package, it shows you accepted it and makes it a lot harder to claim you don't know anything about a box of drugs getting mailed to you.

    Do you guys think a 1/2 oz is considered a personal use size or distribution sized?

    Half ounce in the mail?  User most likely.  If you get caught with a half ounce and a scale and baggies that is another situation.

    I was just going to start up a thread of inquiry into this matter...hope you don't mind I tag along w/ it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's a hypothetical.  SWIK was to receive a usps priority package containing 7g of hash to their po box.  The package never came.  As controlled delivery is impossible at a po box, supposedly there's little to worry about in that regard.  What about the PO Box addy and associated name though?  Have they been red flagged or put on a list of some sort?  It would naturally seem that the po box is now compromised and should not be used as a drop anymore.  What about the residential address of the name on the po?  Is that now compromised as well?  Any usps employees down for the cause have any insight into this...or anyone for that matter?

    From what I know, most states consider anything less than an oz for personal use.  If they are bagged out or your caught with anything that makes you look like a dealer will get you charged for intent to sell like mentioned above.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if you are caught getting those drugs through mail I think that is much worse than simply getting just getting caught with it.  I think that is a felony for drug trafficking because it is going through different state borders.
