    Lost 8 packages in a row, from 4 different countries and 4 different sellers. Sent to 5 different addresses. Never once a customs notice. So i'm guessing we don't get them in UK, but i'm still confused as to how ive lost so much. Its cost me in excess of 2000 pounds. So probably gonna stop using this site now just thought i would put this out there to see if anyone knows about customs notices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I should also add that the most recent product was from a UK vendor so would this imply that even for internal mail we have customs searches?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or do i just have the shittiest luck ever?

    Some where months ago, i stopped ordering for a couple months after they went missing.  Then one was a few weeks ago. The most recent 3 were end of last week. One should have arrived Tuesday the other two should have arrived on Thursday. So i understand they could be delayed but just seems weird all three at once. The addresses are all within a 7 mile zone

    Well your definitely doing some things wrong then.  ::)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Choose a reputable vendor with good reviews and positive feedback.
    <br/>
    2. Purchase goods using a real name and address, preferably within the Escrow system on an established buyer account.
    <br/>
    3. Wait and receive the gold. You probably have a 95% chance of your order arriving.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I honestly don't believe that you could order 8 packages to different addresses and loose them all. Sounds like your either really stupid or more likely trying to spread rumors and scare people away?

    Done, done and done. Only one vendor was a new vendor, which was one of my most recent things and we are currently working things out. Always used real addresses (how else would i get it lol) always the home owners name. Although its irrelevant because at one point i was using random names to a friends house (10+ orders) n never had anything go missing when doing that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Btw I'm hoping someone can explain to me how UK customs work. Do you receive a seizure letter? Or are you just left guessing. I get the feeling since the Olympics that UK customs have really stepped up there game. Never had a problem before then.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How can it be something stupid that I've done if what im doing has worked for first 30+ orders. Hoping someone knows about customs. I am not trying to scare anyone away this site is fantastic and has served me well except for my last 8 orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have one theory but it sounds far fetched even to me, customs caught 3 packs during Olympics with heightened security, put my name (which i had on one parcel to a friends house) and town on list so when i switched to my home address they instantly started checking that mail 2. Then they started to monitor my fb/phone and picked up 2 of the other addresses? Sound feasible to anyone? All i did was ask a mate for his address thru a text (nothing incriminating in the messages).

    As you've mentioned, you've encountered this problem before. 'UK Mail being intercepted/missing since Olympics' http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46094.msg489247#msg489247
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I find it odd you've persisted to make purchases on SilkRoad in this way (by using multiple names and addresses), when you already lost four packages last month through this method, if that was me, I would have ceased using those addresses, and worked out alternative solutions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My suggestion would be change all of your addresses, especially the address I have quoted (is there a chance your packages are being intercepted/stolen by someone at these addresses?), acquire one legit name and address, ensure your writing down your name and address correctly, and make your purchases from reputable vendors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even stranger you state you've lost £2000+. Don't you use the escrow, FE system? 99% of SilkRoad users do, never send your Bitcoins until you receive your purchase. However, you may have placed quantity orders where they have required you to FE, if you have done this, that's the risk you take. Personally, if the vendor won't offer me the option of keeping my Bitcoins in escrow, I simply won't place the order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am not 100% sure but I'm veering on the conclusion you haven't got a customs problem (I don't know how large your purchases were, but if they were large enough and customs intercepted it, logic would suggest you would have had a knock on the door by now), especially if you've had 30+ successful previous purchases, I think you possibly have a people problem, get new legit address, make a few small purchases, and see how you get on from there.

    In answer to your original question about customs letters, they do certainly exist but you are most likely to receive one if you order taxable goods like tobacco. Love letters are much less likely if your order is for illegal goods.
    <br/>
    Your UK to UK order was not caught by customs, there is nowhere that they would meet, if found by postal staff the police would be called, not customs.
    <br/>
    PrincessHigh has probably hit the nail on the head and your orders are being stolen by a friend who knows what you're up to.
    <br/>
    If you want to try a fake package message me on SR :)

    Hmm,  well the first 4 were outwith  SR with a reputable seller on this site so i guess i cant complain about those, they were worth just under 2k and all happened within a week. I was going to get a few replacement packs but my dud/test packs came through with a customs approved stamp (which is what got me wondering where was my letter for previous packs) so ive left that on hold for now. Maybe one day when i finally get mail through consistently il take him up on the offer. That's why i waited a couple months to make some more orders and these were small test runs to see how things went using new addresses. Sadly not so well it seems. The friends addresses are not the type to steal the stuff so i can rule that out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway its good to know that i cant expect a customs letter so its safe to assume if it goes missing its taken by customs. I got a postal note saying i have to pay for a parcel at post office today so at least i know what happened to one, it didn't have a stamp i'm guessing. I guess the others were just a run of bad luck.
    <br/>

    Thanks for the info, wish you all better luck in your purchases lol.
