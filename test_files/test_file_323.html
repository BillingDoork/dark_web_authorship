    I ordered a package priority shipping domestically, the order is fairly large and its an illegal rc in the US.  The DCN says

    and now its processing through sort facility.
    <br/>
    I feel the vendor might have made an error since I made three purchases all together and the other two made it without a problem.  I'm not sure what to do I have the DCN but I don't think I should call.  And I don't think the vendor will give me a refund even though it seems it might have been his fault.  Anyone have advice?

    Could have had some issues during shipment, maybe the issue was fixed by the USPS. The tracking can be pretty slow sometimes, and there's still a chance it's on the way according to the last DCN update in your post.
