    Using my DCN number I have tracked a package. It arrive in the country yesterday and current status is 'held for clearance'. It's a package containing a tiny amount of pharmaceuticals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've done a search on here and there isn't much info. Thoughts welcome.

    Cool appreciate your feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd been doing some reading on clearnet and some people are saying customs holds it until they decide if any duty needs to be paid on it.

    Received a letter from customs saying the package has been held and that I require a letter from a doctor in order to have it released.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Off to see the doc today as I am in fact prescribed the medication. Just happens its much cheaper on here than in my country.

    my doctor has said she will only write a prescription for this package but won't do it in future because the contents can't be trusted i.e. they could be harmful or counterfeit.

    Totally wanted to smash her in the face. Hypocritical woman.

    no offense but i never heard of anything like this? i mean anytime you get something found by customs i have never heard of them saying we need a script required. I mean that would mean that the order contained a pharmacy filled prescription! Which no one i know of offers here? This just does not sound right? I might be wrong but does any one else think this? I mean if you can get a script from your doctor and if it was a scheduled 1 or 2 no way customs is going to say hey just give us a script and your cool. i mean it may be a way of you to admit you ordered shit without a script? and whatever it is. IF you can get a script, they have like canadian pharmacies that fill for like 1/3rd of the cost if your in the us! Idk something just does not sound right? and you got a letter from customs 2 or 3 days after they got the package. Something just not adding up to me. Do you mind me asking what pharmacuticals it was? and again in the us a prescription can only be filled by a licensed pharmacy!? so once again any vets thinking something does not sound right?
    <br/>
    I mean i hope for the best for you but idk does not sound right to me

    Thanks for your concern mate but I'm not sure what you're saying "it does not sound right."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you wondering if I've given you the full story if I'm lying or what?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where I come from this medication is very expensive and they changed something about it in the lab so the efficacy dropped off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've found it difficult to find a reputable online pharmacy to buy these from, that's why I thought I'd try them from here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The way I read the letter is that customs discovered the medication and that it didn't come from a pharmacy therefore they've requested either a letter or prescription from my doctor to release them.

    I wondered about that but they require the original copy and I imagine they could double check the details of the prescription online if they so chose.

    Ktown99 must live in a country where customs sees itself as a public service working for the people and not a bunch of wannabe movie star police.
