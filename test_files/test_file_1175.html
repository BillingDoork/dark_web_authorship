    I placed an order from a very reputable vendor who has been good to me in the past. His communication is a little lacking though due to the volume of sales that he is moving. The package should have been on the 25th, and today, the DCN that he gave me agrees with this. Delivered on the 25th. Friday, Saturday, and yesterday I was sitting at the window for like 6 hours during the hours that the mail man usually comes. That package never reached my mailbox. Resolution will side with the vendor - as he sent the product. It was sent using my real name and I have received orders in the past using that name at this address. What do I do? I want to call USPS but that is kind of sketchy.

    It was almost certainly delivered..just not to you.  There seller could have made an error in the shipping address or you could have made an error giving them the address...or it could have been mistakenly delivered to the wrong address by the mail carrier. (It could have been pinched by the carrier but chances are probably slim)Your best chance to find it will be to ask the mail carrier about it.  There's a good chance they may be able to sort it out but don't wait a day longer.  Strike while things are fresh in the mail carrier's mind.  There's really no way for the PO to know where it was delivered other than the zip code.  Also..ask neighbors if they might have had a piece of your mail delivered to them in error.  If you and the seller trust each other and decide neither of you were in error..it's customary (at least in my circles)for each party to split the loss 50/50.

    The vendor is a total bro and I really hope he helps me out, it was a lot of money for me man. Can I just call the post office in a few hours like "yo where is my package I ordered $100 headphones from ebay express" or is that admitting I'm expecting it and basically turning my self in for a felony?

    The PO will have no more information on your mail than you already have.  They have no way of tracking down where a Priority mail was delivered..only the time and day it was delivered(unless it was sent with added services such as signature confirmation, registered, etc).   Ask your mailman while it may still be fresh in their mind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you receive packages regularly..eventually you are going to lose one.  It happens to everyone.  Do what you can just keep in mind options are limited.

    Does the DCN show address and time of delivery?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also a week of no responses? - Lemme guess. Since I know you from another thread. DT?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seems like Deja Vu all over again! - Actually with both DT's - if you know what I mean.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Give it till today's mail, if you're not close to auto-finalize-which I doubt you are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got stuff today, that should've made it here Saturday, so I figured definitely Tuesday. Nope - Wendesday (yesterday-been up all night! ;D)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did you get the actual Tracking #? (DCN# same thing).

    USPS DCN does not show the address. However it does have a very inaccurate time of delivery, yes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your assumption on the vendor is correct - his communication is lack luster but he has been good to be in the past and I don't think he is trying to pull one over on me. Not on an order this small. Who knows though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm staying up all night to call the local PO as soon as they open - maybe the carrier will still be there so I can ask if they have any idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your comment gives me some hope that it might magically appear tomorrow but shit man - it says delivered - I'm stressing. Thank god I'm not sick anymore though like I was on Saturday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, I have the actual DCN.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: Fuck calling USPS - Not trying to go to prison for a long time.

    Thought I would bump this for some more input - it also did not arrive today. I've had some people tell me fuck it - call - since they do all the time but I tracked the package from tor so I don't know what to do.
