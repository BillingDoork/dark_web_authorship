    Simple question: If an address is flagged, is the name also flagged?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is, if you changed the receiving address, would that new address still be flagged due to being addressed to a common name? What if the new address was in a different state as the old one? And is there any time limit on how long they will keep an address/name flagged (e.g. delete from system after 1 year).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I assume an alternative would be to ask a friend very nicely. Or have it addressed to a former tenant (note that I live in an area where this regularly occurs and I get a lot of old junk mail from several different previous tenants).

    No one will know the answer.

    Just assume both are flagged

    Best to assume both are toasted because (almost) all addresses on mail are scanned/imaged in some way.

    If you get an order intercepted you can guarantee those details will end up on a register. I do not think the mail system is capable of screening mail for certain addresses but your address can be flagged and then LE will intercept all your mail. You would need to be under a full blown investigation for that to happen though so your missing gram of coke will probably not result in that happeningÂ  ;)

    I once got a package intercepted. Well actually let me rephrase that.. He "claimed" the post office called him up after dropping the package off and told him there was something wrong with the package and that he needs to come pick it up. It was a friend of mine, and this was before I used SR, and this was only some benzo pills (xanax). I'm assuming that if they had not been calling him because they found drugs (ie if it was wrong postage or invalid addresss or missing something), that eventually they wud send the package to a lost mail sorting facility, which would then eventually be opened. Either way i figured they found the drugs or wud soon find them.
    <br/>
    So I bugged out for a bit and then after I realized the feds arent coming to do a controlled delivery on me for 100 pills I looked around and found SR. I started off with small (5 pill) orders and have been working my way up and all the packages seem to thru fine. Recently i even made a 100 pill order which came thru fine and i also got an overseas hash order which made it thru ok.
    <br/>
    Maybe theyve been keeping tabs on me maybe not but so far I have 14 orders and over $1000 USD spent, its all personal amounts so as long as I'm not ordering huge kingpin amounts I'm not worried.

    Yeah as long as they don't get multiple shipments at once and there is nothing for them to find at your house than fuck it. Only time I would worry is if I lived with others that don't need cops showing up. But me? whatever.
