    -It's very hot out where I live, and wearing gloves when picking up shipping material would be rather suspicious.
    <br/>
    -The girlfriend may be willing to pick them up for me, but I would rather not involve such a wonderful person in an operation of this sort.
    <br/>
    -Could order them online, but then I leave a purchasing (paper-trail)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Preferably I'd want some advice on temporary finger print modification/disguise that couldn't be readily seen.  I'm not talking about mutilating my finger-tips either.  I want to be at the place that I buy the shipping gear from myself, because only I would know exactly what I need based on the orders, because sending a random friend in instead of me would lead to mix-ups, and time-wasted.  Not to mention the inevitable questioning of why I have him buy shipping materials every week, because honestly the less people that know what I'm up to, the better. And I'm sure all of you would agree.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hell, if anyone knows a method for destroying the oils that finger prints leave without compromising the shipping-gear's appearance, then I'd be happy to try that instead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you for your time reading this, and any input you all may have.

    Burner phones in my opinion are a burn in themselves.  Thank you for the suggestion, but are there any others?
    <br/>
    But in my experience, burner phones not only add unnecessary expenses, but more importantly they take up too much room in my pockets (which is important to me, lol).  And only to use a pre-paid phone to use for a select few #'s is some Bin Laden shit if you ask me.  And I ain't trying to get run up on by a drug task force, let alone a team of navy seals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Literally if someone just knows a place that saran-wraps their shipping-materials, then I wouldn't even have this problem.  I just haven't come across any such inventory.

    Superglue on your fingers?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or you could just wear very simple black winter gloves (the thin cloth). People will just think you're weird. If anyone asks why you have gloves on just tell them your hands were terribly burned as a child and you don't like the stares people give you. Nobody is going to ask you to take off your gloves after that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe you'll start a new wave fashion.

    I just had the idea (&amp; please let me know how you all honestly feel about it, because I take this whole thing very seriously, and I'd rather sound like an idiot than feel like an idiot sitting next to Bubba in a jail-cell):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was thinking about perhaps obtaining some disposable contact lenses, and some super-glue.   Just past a few of those onto each finger, &amp; then I could easily peel them off with some acetone?  That's the best I can think of at the moment.  Totally invisible unless seriously inspected.   They might make a funny sound when holding the boxes/letters or money when buying it all.  Decisions, decisions...

    I don't have the luxury of bare-handing anything.  The prints are on file in the database.  Like I said, I'd rather be (ridiculously) over-cautious than risk slipping up over something as stupid as a finger-print.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry for bugging, I'll just figure out what works best with some more research... oh joy, hah.

    That sounds pretty good, I like this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even just ripping off the skin-colored adhesive part of a band-aide could be stuck to every finger, and should virtually go unnoticed.  Thanks a lot man.

    A few thoughts:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - liquid bandaid. there is a spray on "Liquid bandaid" that covers your skin and seals it . this might help hide your fingerprint. not entirely sure
    <br/>
    - not sure if this is true in other countries but in Canada they sell the prepaid express post envelopes in value packs. if youre selling more then  one or two envelopes it pays to go this way too. the value packs are usually 4 or 5 prepaid envelopes sealed up. the express post ones have a plastic wrap around them so its safe to touch that as u just take it home and rip of the shrink wrap and dont touch the actual envelopes inside
    <br/>
    - if buying one prepaid envelope or ur post office doesnt have value packs that are shrink wrapped ask them to put it in a bag for you. this has worked 9/10 times for a vendor i was talking to. at canada post they have their own counter and u cant take the envelope until u pay anyways so ask them when you're paying to put it in a bag.
    <br/>
    - worse case wear a long sleeved shirt and pick up the envelope with the shirt sleeve covering your prints. dont do this at the same post office more then once in a row. this could get a bit suspicious but would definitely work a few times no problem. u could just be a germaphob. even say that to them if they look at u funny. lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hope my insight helps a bit.

    Bubble envelopes sometimes are sold in boxes, just don't ship anything in the box the envelopes came in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd use leather gloves when handling bundles of cardboard boxes anyway.  Just take em off my belt, pick up the bundles and throw them in the back of the truck.

    I totally understand trying to be safe and all but are they really going to get your prints off a box containing a dime bag that just traveled across the country in three days? Are they even going to bother looking for prints or DNA? It seems like some of you are just just a little too paranoid or something. There is a difference between being safe and being paranoid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not trying to be a dick, I just think this thread is a little overboard and shocked it is still going.

    agreed. but keeping prints off the inside of a pack or off the underside of labels/tape is very simple to do and would tie you to the pack pretty solidly if found.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    common sense.
