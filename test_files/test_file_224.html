    Various illegal things from everywhere: 80+

    Luckily I'm friendly with my postman, but he finds it hilarious that various packages come to my delivery address daily in random names.

    that is unreal and awesome to know!  funniest thing is, i have started doing that
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for instance, i knew one day my package was coming from NL a big one and i took out an item (that shall remain vague and general) so as to start small talk outside..needless to say it worked and he was real chipper and i probably made his day
    <br/>
    <br/>
    little did he know he made my dad as he dropped over 300 pills at my door

    Yeah, being friendly with your postman is a life saver.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been tipped off about all sorts of stuff, such as when the police were watching my house (when I used to do fraud stuff). He now even leaves packages for me in a certain place that even if the police raided me they wouldn't find anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I always tip him at Christmas (£200 / $300), which helps I suppose  :) Nothing wrong with greasing the pole a little bit.

    Well I had one vendor send 5. 2 oz packages of weed, and a international package with 17grams of mephedrone..   They all arrived on the same day.  The Mail person looked like a pizza person.   The mail person handed me my packages and went about their day.

    Do you "bigger" guys remember your first order?  Did you get paranoid waiting around for it?  I've been nervous all day for a lowly oz of weed and it's from Canada to Canada.  Seems now it will sit over the weekend in a shipping center somewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It helps put the mind at ease to read these types of threads, and knowing that this happens all the time.  I like the one about pizza delivery man...
