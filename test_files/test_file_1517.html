    Ok so im wondering whats the best Option for posting anonymously. And by anonymously i mean to blend in amongst other daily business mail.
    <br/>
    A window envelope. The normal white envelopes with the See through window on them And the Name Printed On a piece of paper inside the envelope .
    <br/>
    OR
    <br/>
    A normal envelope with no window and a label on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers all

    any envelope :P? you gotta remember people in post offices see this shit all day long.. after long enough it all becomes standard.. the whole idea is keeping it simple an not suspicious looking. use a real return address as well, but not to you.

    Using correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization does a lot towards looking professional.  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd think the window envelopes would be sketch because if for some reason anything comes loose it could move into view maybe?  I think the flat rate mailing envelopes not only look professional but badass and serious business.  But for standard post, I'd probably just use normal letter envelopes.

    Yes i would basically have my buyers make sure they type everything correctly as most of it will be copy and pasted onto labels, However if of course a buyer makes a mistake and i see it i would do my best to correct it.
