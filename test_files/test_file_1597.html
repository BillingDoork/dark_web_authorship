    If one plans on ordering large bulk internationally it seems tough to get the package safely. These options are all assuming that police intercept it. I believe people should plan for the worst when it comes to their safety.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can get the item sent to your house and claim you never ordered it if you get a CD, but that is pretty risky and is just not a good option. The police could be building a case against you, intercepting all of your packages without your knowledge and then one day going in for the kill before you are able to clean house. Extremley rare? yes, but it can happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can have the item sent to a fake PO box but if police are nerby when you go to pick up your package you will be doing time, no questions asked. Getting a 24 hour box would help and even if you wait 8 days the LE would have put a tracking device in it to go off as soon as you open it, and a GPS device if you do not open it. Then if a officer is 1 or 2 minutes away or even closer and the package starts to move/ is opened and you cant dart in time, it is over. Or if the fake ID you are using is compromised (you purchased it off LE like celtic but it has not come out yet that they are LE) or they can use facial recognition to your own ID and figure out who you are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This seems like the best option, but is not an option for some of us: Get a package sent to a neighbor where you have acsess to their mailbox, either an apartment complex without cameras or a street where all the mailboxes are bunched up together and you can run out as soon as the package is dropped off, make sure no one is watching or no cameras have been placed and grab it. If LE decide to CD it will not go to your house and if they put a tracking device in it you can open it in a designated area with gloves on and see if their is tracking. If their is a tracking device in it you can grab the drugs and run. Make sure their are no police around first and wear a desguise just in case their are hidden cameras somewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another option is paying someone who does not know who you are to accept packages for you and make a foolproof method for picking the package up so if they had been taken by LE you would know before hand and not pick up the package. But I do not know how someone would go about finding someone like this.
    <br/>

    I try to stick to domestic 100% of the time but sometimes what I want has to be ordered internationally in montly quantities that could be confused for more than personal use. Obviously this is very paranoid but it safety is number 1 to me, if you are not paranoid about your freedom then you have some values to swap around.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are the best options for ordering international?

    You sound way to paranoid. I order international 90% of the time and only use domestic when I want it fast or the prices are as competitive as international. And I'm usually ordering bulk. I know my mailman, though, and I use good vendors with good stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But on days when I plan on receiving a package I go for a cig around my area, just in case I see some cops posting up or something, I dont know.

    Just be careful and make the suppliers packaging is on point. Just recently DEA and customs are starting to sweep up packages from India and China. I'm not sure if it's related to what's going on with Bitcoin but too me it seems that this is a joint plan that the Government is cracking down on Bitcoin, checking out international packages. I think this is a plan that they formulated at the beginning of the year and now implementing it behind the scenes. All the current events lead me to believe this. Make sure your drop doesn't lead back to you, that's all I can say.

    For bulk orders, you might want to look into light sensors or other devices that could tip you off if the package is opened. Then get a PO box in a fake name and if you believe the package is compromised and a CD is coming, throw away the key and never visit that post office again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There might be something better than light sensors though. Quite often the packages are x-rayed first, so they could determine a device like that is inside and simply open it in a darkroom.

     mom n pops are the way to go.

     24 hour UPS / fed ex are the next.

     <br/>
     Have someone else sign. Do not have them bring the package straight to you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As long as you never open it, you're fine, legally, based on my research..... though I have read some troubling intel on that topic.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When I was just starting to learn this shit, a very experienced member told me that they will allow packs to get through to build a case and show that you knew what was in the packs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's a fucking gamble, even this way. Make your $ and get the fuck out. Don't be stupid like, cough, me, and get stuck doing it longer term.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I never had any issues until I had done quite a few and I know other people that never lost packs until they had ordered more than 30.

    yea, i've read while lurking that mom and pops are best but UPS has pretty much taken over.
    <br/>
    i didnt know fedex did mailbox tho...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    btw that case building thing is the definition of terror and suspense.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also thanks for the advice dude.
    <br/>
    might just blitz order and stock a few more bulk and then quit ordering altogether.
