    Hope all is well with anyone reading this. ___ is a little worried however being that __ received a peach slip from usps telling ___ to come to the post office to pick up __'s package which is very strange being that __ didn't order it with Signature Confirmation? now what __ was thinking is that the vendor accidentally shipped it with Sig. Conf. ,___  accidently ordered with SIG. CONF. ,or they've (LE} discovered the contents of said parcel. What made it even more eerie is that they didn't even knock on the door to deliver the package otherwise __ would have heard them they just left a slip telling me to come down! and the Senders return address was written in complete unintelligible chicken scratch. Please anyone with some insight please help. I don't understand how tabs would be intercepted.

    Let it go. Not worth it man. Bite the bullet on this one. You've got nothing (but a little cash) to lose by letting it go. You've got a lot to lose by going there to pick it up and/or signing for it and getting arrested for possession.

    Double check with your vendor about it and clean your house, depending on your country they may not actually need you to sign for the package to raid your house afterwards (I don't know US law though).

    I think its a bit of an overreaction, whats more likely, LE doing a drug bust and screwing up something they would have had to do on previous ones or a lazy postal worker.

    I have to agree. Just let it go. It may be EXTREMELY tempting considering that everything very well could be fine but its not really worth it. Of course the OP was very vague as to the amount of product in the package but im assuming if you think there could be a possibility of a CD attempt that its more than a personal amount.

    I only asked weight because I assumed it was powder of some sort. I'd ask Tyler and wait for a response from him before doing anything. That said a few thousand of anything he sells doesn't look like it'd really be worth more than $1500 so if the legality of the tabs in your state is questionable I'd likely just abandon it. If they have caught it then they will likely be assuming it is LSD and would prosecute as such forcing you to get it chemically tested and proved to not be but then you've got the whole shit heap of the analogue laws etc and the fact they can probably argue it's intended for human consumption because it's laid on blotters. As I said though I don't know US law, consult a lawyer if you need that.

    Hey guys back to update.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The person who lives at my drop address went down to the post office shortly before they closed(unbeknown to me)  and retrieved the parcel with no problems, however they still made him sign for it. I finally spoke with the vendor and I believe he or one of his associates marked the wrong shipping option which is completely fine accidents happen, I just wish i got in touch before I threw all of my glass out lol. I understand I may have over reacted a bit but I've been busted before and I'm not trying to go that route ever again! just remember guys never take this stuff lightly this is an extremely illegal game we play lol. thanks for all the kind words and info.

    It's more suspicious if you don't  go..Any person who gets a slip would be curious to see what package they're talking about...But like others mentioned clean up shop before you go...go in and see what they have for you...If it don't feel mark it return to sender and leave, mention you don't know who the shipper is or maybe you thought a family member sent you something but it's not...Either way, not showing up, suspicious. Also if you don't go, they'll just come to you and it'll be worse... Good luck! Did they leave a reason why on the card...Usually it says what the reason is or you can wait a day and call them to find out.. Just act curious and clueless when needed...You'll be fine.
