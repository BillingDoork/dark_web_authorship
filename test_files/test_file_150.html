    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to ask if anyone has shipped to Egypt successfully
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have boxes &amp; packages shipped to me all the time through UPS/FedEx/DHL/Aramex from the US (non-illicit, mostly electronics &amp; watches and such)... ALL OF THEM have been opened without an exception. the thing is not about security (security is actually a joke) or anti-drug shit... it's all about paying customs &amp; taxes!! the shipping company actually declares EVERYTHING and every single box is opened
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know about letters or documents. and the local postal system is not very good, I shipped through it once, and the box was also opened. I don't know about letters &amp; documents, and I'm not sure they even reach their destination. That's why delivery companies are very popular in Egypt despite having high prices &amp; having the worst customer service on earth!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm interested in LSD &amp; ganja mainly (I know that it's like the national drug!! but I don't wanna go around asking + I'm not sure about the quality)
    <br/>
    any ideas or experiences?

    <br/>
    c'mon people!! they smuggle weapons across all borders, they are addicted to crack &amp; cannabis... and no one knows a simple answer to a sheet of LSD?
