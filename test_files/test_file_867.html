    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I recently ordered a package internationally. The tracking info has got me a little paranoid. It was expected to arrive today, but didn't turn up. Two things in the tracking have been concerned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. The tracking itself:
    <br/>
    item has been received at the delivery office in the destination country (latest post - 35 hours ago)
    <br/>
    Item arrived at postal facility. Item on hold. (46 hours ago)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact it went on hold and is taking so long is worrying me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. There is no indication of it going through customs/arriving at customs despite being an international shipment. Is this common? I have never seen my order not show the customs in the tracking when it is international.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So basically my question is, has my packaged been seized? What does the tracking info say when a package has been intercepted? Thanks

    There's no standard answer to your question.  Each area's Postal Inspectors don't necessarily stick wit4h t4he2 same procedures.  Sometimes tracking will say pkg has been seized but in most cases you'll  know only if LE shows up at your door or i3f you get notices to pick up a pkg that should have been delivered.  Sometimes they will call you if they have the number.

    I agree with th3creeper, however don't read too much into it. As a seller I have seen packages go through exactly what you are describing, on several cases. In every single case, the package was successfully delivered (despite an initial scare that this one was going to be my first seized package).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To specifically address your concerns:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. The item on hold --&gt; the postal office/outlet is dealing with a high volume of packages. Why does yours go on hold? Cause you need to wait your turn in line. But they update the tracking just so they know the last location it was. It is not at the delivery office, so should be going out soon
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Customs not showing on tracking --&gt; while I can't guarantee my explanation is correct, I have seen it happen before and get delivered. My explanation, either the package seems fair enough/stealth enough that it just passes through customs so it is not scanned. Or they just forget to scan it all together at customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So do not worry mate, I have been in your shoes, only to see it get Successfully Delivered after 2-4 days. Contact the seller, see what they say, and just wait it out for a week or so. If after a week nothing shows, then maybe it is time to panic!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I would keep your house clean just in case, although in Canada to get a  house warrant off a single drug package with no other evidence would be next to impossible. Unless you have a record of trafficking or something similar, I just don't see your house getting raided off a single package. Most likely love letter, but lets hope its just delayed. Keep us updated!
