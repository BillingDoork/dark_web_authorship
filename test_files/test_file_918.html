    I was browsing and came across a 100g listing of Methylone from China. My guess is that there's a 99% chance that it has no chance at making it through customs.
    <br/>
    Hoping a veteran can share some insight... Or if some other Aussie vendor can hook me up. They were asking for a little under $550, I'm happy to pay more obviously for Aussie stuff, can someone help a brother out?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers.

    There'd be a reasonable chance it would make it through - they can't check all packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It definitely wouldn't be a great chance but im sure if you ordered a few you'd get one through, if its packaged reasonably well.

    Doesn't really seem worth sending a bunch of packages only to receive either 1 or possibly none...

    Just depends on the price. Unless it were under 20-25% of the domestic price or better, I agree it wouldn't be worth it.

    During the past five years a friend of mine had great success with M1 from China.
    <br/>
    8/10 packages got through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As it's a 'fairly' rare analogy. .....Perhaps lack of training of canine detection....had something to do with it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My mate doesn't import it anymore but the prices you quote are reasonable.

    It looks like you're pretty new to SR.
    <br/>
    Personally I would advise you to take some more time to read and research before making such a huge order.

    P.S. It's probably quite possible but just because it's possible doesn't make it a sure thing.

    It would have to be on the off chance, the person was scratching their bum or on a piss break for it to get through.
    <br/>
    Someone made a large order from frankmatthews split into heaps of small packages, NONE arrived.

    1 Proper packaging + concealment &gt; Sending multiple packages, that arent packaged/stealthed properly

    My largest order to arrive was 100g all in one pack, having said that ive never ordered anything from china though, but i imagine it wouldn't be too hard, there is lots of mail coming through from china.
