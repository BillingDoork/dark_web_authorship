     By the Numbers
     <br/>
     <br/>
     167.9 billion — number of mail pieces processed in 2011
     <br/>
     554 million — average number of mail pieces processed each day
     <br/>
     23 million — average number of mail pieces processed each hour
     <br/>
     384,000 — average number of mail pieces processed each minute
     <br/>
     6,400 — average number of mail pieces processed each second
     <br/>
     40 — percent of the world’s mail volume handled by the Postal Service
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Postal Inspectors arrested more than 5,500 suspects for crimes involving the mail or against the Postal Service in 2011. About half of the arrests involved mail theft and more than 750 involved mail-related fraud.
     <br/>
     Postal Inspectors deploy state-of-theart screening equipment designed to identify hazardous substances and suspicious items in the mail and to ensure safety at postal facilities while keeping the mail moving.
     <br/>
     In 2011, Postal Inspectors responded to more than 3,550 incidents involving suspicious items, substances, powders or liquids in the mail or at postal facilities. Of those incidents, 212 involved improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
     <br/>
     Postal Inspectors seized $13.1 million in proceeds related to illegal drugs from the mail in 2011.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Postal Inspection Service’s National Forensic Laboratory, composed of more than 60 highly trained forensic scientists, plays a key role in identifying, apprehending and convicting suspects responsible for criminal offenses against the Postal Service.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Forensic Laboratory Services provides forensic services and technical support in the following areas:
     <br/>
     - Fingerprint and Automated Fingerprint
     <br/>
     - Identification System (AFIS)
     <br/>
     - Questioned Documents and Imaging
     <br/>
     - Physical Sciences
     <br/>
     - Digital Evidence
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In 2011, Forensic Laboratory Services analysts examined more than 80,000 documents, fingerprints, controlled substances, audio, video, digital media and other items of physical evidence. The examinations resulted in the identification of 443 subjects, of which 94 were identified through (AFIS).

    If you mean physically searched by a human/dog the number is probably something ridiculously low, under 5-10%. I'm assuming your asking about shipping coke from Columbia since you have the other thread. They probably are a lot stricter on packages and more normal on small letters but I'm just speculating and have no experience with Columbia or shipping coke.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Going by the numbers I posted
    <br/>
    554million — average number of mail pieces processed each day
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assume 10% of the 554 million are international packages so you have 55.4 million coming in. To inspect 1% of those would be 554,000 packages, or 5,540,000 for 10% inspected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With Columbia being a flagged country though, combined with it being relatively small and not an industrial center like China I think they would be scrutinized much more and have less packages being sent.

    namuld has some great info.  I would guess that the actual amount of items searched is low- (maybe even just 1 or 2%), if your package looks suspicious and especially if it is coming from a 'drug source' country; you can count on the searches being closer to 10-20%.  If I were you, I would send a few packages to see if they get through and go from there.  DEFINITELY read the 'sticksies' at the top of this forum and the thread I will paste below on what the postal service looks for to determine suspicious packages.  There is a lot of good info on this topic.

    I'd say way way less than 25%. They just don't have the manpower. I will tell you the bigger the package the more likely to be opened. Over about 1 kg and its very likely. If i had to make a guess, i'd say no more than 10% get more than glanced at and less than 2% are opened. It depends on the country, china raises a lot of red flags, colombia may, pakistan, a few others.

    The 1 kg thing? This is just from what i've heard from legit importers who got stuff seized that wasn't even illegal. Stuff like betel nut for example. No law against it but usa customs will intercept it. I got a shipment of cactus from africa and if they had opened it it would have been grabbed for sure but it was only about 1 lb. All the ones that got every shipment grabbed were at least a kg or more. The packages that almost never get opened or very seldom are ones that look like ordinary letters. Anything under an oz or two will get through except maybe for australia.
