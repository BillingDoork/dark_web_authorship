    So I recently placed an order for 5 Mortal Kombats, from a reputable and well-known vendor (don't know if there'd be an issue mentioning which) I had tried these rolls over the July 4th holiday and was pleasantly impressed so I wanted to order more, though last time I had gotten them from a different vendor. Now they were shipped 8 days ago (priority mail) and there has been no delivery. The vendor has been kind and helpful throughout all the PM's we have been sending back and forth and hes updated me at every turn and answered every question. Even gave me the tracking number after a few days. Now the issue as it stands, is the package has been cris-crossing my state through two specific sorting facilities. Processed and departing each almost every day going back and forth between each but neither are actually anywhere near where the package is meant to be delivered. I've been assured that the stealth is layered so even if the package was opened there would be no indication as to the contents. So the vendor recommended me to call the post office with the tracking number to see if they could give me any information as to whats going on. But I'm concerned with doing that due to the bizarre nature of the shipping. The vendor again assured me he has had people with false names, or wrong addresses go to the post office and pick up their packages but this situation fits for neither. The address was right on both my end and the vendor's end and I had used a real name that always receives mail at the delivery address. So I'm just looking for advice here as to any prior experiences with a shipping situation like this and if there may be any reason for me to worry here. I've by no means yet given up hope on this package so I'm not at refund/re-ship talk and there's still 9 days left for me to finalize so I just wanted to reach out to the forums for any advice. Thanks for reading and for any help/advice.  8)

    Never heard of anything like this before. Maybe the USPS put the wrong label on it and it is in an infinite loop. I'd let it loop a few more days and then, if it is still doing it, I'd have someone (maybe claiming to be the sender?) call (using an anonymous temporary phone number I think you can now get on the internet?) to provide the tracking # and say something like :
    <br/>
    "tracking shows this package is bouncing back and forth instead of getting delivered. Can you check to see if it is stuck in the system?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe this is one of the ways packages get delayed for no know reason?

    Yeah me neither. In the history of me having packages sent, SR or otherwise (including all shipments, legal purchases) have I ever seen a shipping behavior like this. That does sound like a route I could take but I'm curious as to if they asked for even just a name for identity if the individual was asking for status on a package, even with a tracking number. But I'm not sure. Obviously if they asked for name, assuming I or someone else would be acting as a sender, I'd have no way of knowing what that is. Again with only 5 rolls even if the package was compromised I'm hoping there would be no need for the trouble of a CD and a love letter would be sent.

    I guess I am assuming the vendor would be assisting you by giving you the return address info or making the call.

    Someone posted something similar recently, and said the PO told them one sorter kept scanning the return address instead of the delivery address, so it would send it to the wrong sort facility, then that facility would scan the delivery address and send it back, over and over.

    This.  I read that thread although I can't find it now.  I also read in another thread where a buyer took it upon himself to reach out to the post office by calling and asking for their help by explaining the situation.  Might have been the same thread.  After a phone call or two and letting them know what was going on the USPS was able to sort it out in a matter of a few days.  Even though your package contains contraband it's better to be proactive and try to get it back on track than to have it end up at the dead letter office and have them open it.

    I normally would have no issue calling but I've just never seen a shipping pattern like this and having checked the tracking early this morning its been sitting at one of the sorting facilities for over 48 hours now with no movement which for me draws a little suspicion. I agree it would be better to be proactive as I don't want any difficulties with my stats on the Road and I hope its just a bizarre set of circumstances with the package eventually showing up. But I have to assume the latter for my safety, I wouldnt want to get caught up over just a few rolls.  :-\

    So I still haven't received this package and its movement has stopped at one of the sorting facilities with no movement in over 4 days. Would it be safe to assume its been compromised at this point? Should I take the order into the resolve center now? I haven't received a message back from the vendor when asking him what he thinks we should do about the situation.

    I've had a package do that to me before. Out of over 50 SR purchases this only happened to me once (well twice actually..) It bounced back and forth between customs and the sorting facility in my state (one state over) before finally staying at my local post office. Then for the next 3 days it bounced back and forth between my post office and the sorting facility. Then suddenly the tracking went dead while it was sitting in sort facility. After 5 weeks the seller sent a reship and the reship did the same thing, but not as much as the first one. Bounced back and forth twice and then landed on my doorstep a couple days later. I received the package 3 weeks ago but the tracking still says that its sitting in sort facility. Hmm lucky for the seller I'm not an asshole whos gona try to score free drugs bec of what the tracking says..
    <br/>
    Oh by the way, this package originated in europe if that helps..

    Thanks for your input, Ive had over 20 orders here now and this is the firs time I've had any experience like this. This was a domestic shipment though, only real difference between your situation, which makes it even more puzzling. Did you resolve the order through the site or did the vendor just offer a re-ship himself?

    vendor offered a reship on his own and told me to extend the due date by hitting resolve. We didnt agree to anything except to extend the due date.

    There is nothing too unusual about the tracking history of the package as you've described.  Obviously, there some issue preventing it from being delivered to you but there's no real way to know at this point other than what tracking tells you.  It's doubtful the pkg has been seized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's what you CAN do to resolve things providing you are willing to make inquiries.  There are any number of legitimate reasons why it's not been delivered yet.  Find the local phone number of the USPS faculty that last scanned the pkg...this is most likely a sort facility.  Do this by goggling the zip code listed on that last known scan.  Call that facility and ask for the Supervisor on duty and make your inquiry with that person using the tracking number.  If that's where it was last scanned that's where it most likely sits.  You may be able to find out why it's not been delivered and make any corrections necessary..or you may be able to go physically pick t up providing you have ID that matches the addressee.

    I would hope the Vendor would discuss it with you, at least. There is a chance they realized it was bouncing and it is in a bin that "needs further handling" to get it going in the correct direction? I would not assume it is compromised yet.
