    I hear PO boxes are bad idea in general.  Some people here recommend using virtual mail box services.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPS could work if you can find fake ID and documents to open one up.  But, there are cameras in every location, so if they really wanted to catch you, they could conjure up the evidence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For small consumer use, I would personally say just order to your house.  Don't make too many purchases at one time.  Space out your orders and don't buy in bulk.  I'd also try to avoid ordering things that have smell too.

    can anyone comment on the relative security of a mom/pop mailbox?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also, a quick question for anyone who has used PO box or mom/pop mailbox: what are good excuses/reasons for getting one? if they ask.
    <br/>

    ups store mailbox with fake id is the way to go, my friend.  a small initial start up cost, but it will save you some headaches in the future.  you should try to use a picture on the id that looks a lot like you, but isn't you.  ups store will give you a po box that uses suite numbers rather than a po box number too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    an earlier poster mentioned something about cameras, but remember that without a name, your picture is like your finger print, useless.  just use you phony id and when you go wear a ball cap low (it's what all the kids are doing these days anyway!) and unless you're importing keys of coke, the 5-0 aren't going to put your picture on the news.

    This is very true, and your home has some constitutional protection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree with the guy who said fake ID low ball cap different photo. Good call.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's a little warm up. Go in an chat them up first. Smile and buy stamps and mail something. Do it when the place is dead and they are bored. That way when you com in to get a box they are friendly and treat you like a regular, not a creep. Also, virtual boxes are not the same - they are mail forwarding only boxes. pretty cool and cheaper. but they have to go somewhere else.

    One thing to take into consideration with some of those virtual mail box type places is that that the receptionist  cannot sign for registered post articles. I found this out the hard way recently when I had something sent to me which I then had to go to the big mail centre to sign for it.
