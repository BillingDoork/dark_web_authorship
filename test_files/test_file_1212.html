    I haven't found enough discussion on this topic. As a new vendor, I've been studying how to ship stealthily and discreetly and can't settle upon a shipping method.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is the USPS website the main route. And if so, how to ship small packages first class with USPS? Will it require my PayPal and is this security threat avoidable?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any questions or hopefully advice would be greatly appreciated and useful to the community of vendors.

    It does not sound like you have searched the Forum very well. Make sure you are at the top level of the forum (or you are only searching the subforum you are in) and try words like tracking label. In my opinion, online postage is very complicated to be able to use safely and links your packages to one another. I'd say try stamps and tracking labels and blue boxes if you can stay well under 13 Ozs. Paypal and creditcards linked to your real identity seem totally unacceptable.

    I've already done some online postage quite anonymously, but I'm not sure if it's worked yet or not.

    Now I wish I would have posted this first. Thank you NW Nugz for your knowledge!

    There are ways to use USPS click and ship anonymously. It really is the best method of posting anonymously in the USA. You just have to either pay for the rights to the info or get lucky enough for someone to give it to you. I had to pay for my info, so, I will not be giving it out. But, if you look hard enough you will be able to obtain the info.

    Prepaid credit Card? I could get a prepaid card and sign up for usps.com this way, but I like the stamps and tracking labels better for now.
