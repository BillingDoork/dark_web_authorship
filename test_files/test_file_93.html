    Okay, so my Mom (18, live with 'rents until College) informed me that she is required to meet with the post-master due to the legality of an item. This item is most likely speed from Netherlands or Germany as both were ordered at the same time.

    You're not fucked. Don't listen to that asshole.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't tell your mom anything. If she asks, you don't know. The less she knows, less likely it is she will accidentally leak info. to the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only idea you have about this, is maybe some of your friends from Europe thought it would be a funny/nice present to send you some speed in the mail one night they got really drunk and coked up. But you don't really know anything. Deny everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Clean all drugs from your house. Format you hard drive, not the quick format, the full format. Get rid of any incriminating evidence from your house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the mail was under a fake name, that is very good. If it was under your name, that is worse, but still ok.

    I agree with the previous posters - deny all knowledge, refuse to answer questions. If they had enough on you to prove possession they would simply have arrested you by now.

    It still doesn't make sense that your mom was required to go, if the parcel is in your name then legally at the least you would go and she would have to accompany you, but to ask her to go on her own? That doesn't make sense at all, unless the post officer likes you and just wants to keep things under the carpet. Maybe he thinks she doesn't know about your drug usage and wants to do the responsible parent talk thing. Either way you're fine as they haven't put anything in writing which legally if they were going to do things further they would have to have done by now. Let us know what happens afterwards  :)

    Maybe tell your mum what you ordered instead of letting her take the wrap for it.  Some times you just need to man up and take responsibility for your actions and at least she knows what she is in for. Next time don't be so fucking stupid and order drugs to you parents address, get a PO box.

    Tell your mum to skip that meeting, and if the postman mentions it again to ignore him.  Dont pull a DaveH0we and let Drug Enforcement Agents into your house and hand over your whole stash.

    I still aint been arrested or indited but that could change any time.

    basically same thing happened to me a few years back, i wasnt living with my mom but i did use her address, shes a high ranking officer in the military and is stated on her address so i guess the postal inspector was feeling patriotic or somethin..haha and he gave her a basic heads up and told her my options(give consent to search and deny ownership, or claim ownership and have them search it in front of me with the local police.) wonder which one i chose? The fact that he contacted your mother means your in the clear. if they wanted to arrest you, you never would have been able to post this.

    UPDATE:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My mom had the meeting yesterday. She was told by the postmaster that something sent to our mailbox was under investigation and that our mail from now on will be watched. She mentioned they were really short about details and wouldn't say much about what was in the package or where it came from.  Supposedly if it happens again we'll receive a letter from customs. Although this is the best possible thing to happen, I'll still be awaiting letter. I have 2 speed orders and a package of research chems from the States.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just want to thank the forum for being caring and making the whole situation a lot less sketchy. You guys are amazing and the best vibes to you all.

    Irony of this situation. I also had ordered 5g's of M but the guy's supplier didn't come through and it was delayed. I was really close to having a very sketchy encounter with that, as well as losing out on the product. Thankfully, I had time during this to cancel and not get fucked by customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another thing is my best friend had a dream the night before this happened that the mail lady was accusing his mom of being a meth dealer. Speed, meth, Post-master, mail lady. My friend now assumes his dreams predict the future.
