    I'm curious how I would go about sending a package of gold into Brazil undetected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts?

    I've had a similar problem, only I needed to get the gold to Europe. I absolutely couldn't afford to loose any of it so I decided to go on a vacation and bring the gold in the form of 1/10th, 1/4, 1/2 and 1/1 ounce coins with me in my wallet.
    <br/>
    Don't know what form your gold is in or what amount you're thinking of but this has worked for me like a charm for going on a decade and roughly 8 trips.
    <br/>
    I've never even gotten a second look from the x-ray machine operators, just a wallet full of random coins to them and the price of airfare is well worth the risk that has been eliminated.
    <br/>
    As far as i know it is legal to carry up to 10k $ worth without declaring. If you can prove you are the rightful owner and where it comes from you can declare and bring more.
    <br/>
    Don't know if this was any help to you at all since you were asking for shipping but I wish you good luck in any case.

    Very solid answer, thanks!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I'm looking at shipping 1.5 pounds (0.7 kg)
    <br/>
    That would be an awful lot of vacations     :D

    presumably you want to avoid any kind of documentation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "it just might work" : buy a bunch of used scuba equipment including weight belt, and use just a bit of your fortune to reshape your gold into one of the weights, lead plated, then go for a scuba diving holiday in brazil. I'm assuming here on an x-ray the lead will look the same as the gold, you'd want to verify that first.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the sensible idea: divvy it up into multiple shipments, send from and to multiple places, use multiple companies if available, mix it in with fishing lures or whatever. Insure each. Anything that gets nicked you claim on the insurance.
