    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I discovered Silkroad a few months ago and immediately loved it. In the beginning everything arrived super fast, even day after ordering for most European country's.
    <br/>
    Lately I've began to notice that orders are taking longer to arrive then normal. IM FROM BELGIUM BTW. Has anybody from Belgium noticed this before?
    <br/>
    I haven't (yet) ordered large amounts and the orders are posted with my real name and address, so nothing to draw attention. I mostly order Cocaine and Benzo's, occasionally some psychedelics or amphetamines.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone ever had an address 'becoming hot'? If so, please explain it a bit as I'm really getting worried. No, I am not paranoid due to excessive drug use or whatever. I have lot's of experience with ordering stuff online and have a good sense of when something will arrive. Until now... Maybe international deliveries from Canada and such?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is for personal use FOR FUCK'S SAKE, go get the big guys in Colombia who start wars and cut it with levamisole. They are the real criminals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks for your help, hope this gets some attention.
    <br/>

    Bullshit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Belgium isn't America or anything crazy like that.
    <br/>
    You would get your customs letter and then you can expect to pay a fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it takes a while longer and no customs letter i would not be worried.
    <br/>
    It also depends on where it's coming from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What does the tracking system say when you look it up.

    I've never received any orders that came with tracking. All my orders are user amounts, nothing large (yet). I do believe the authorities here have little interest (and knowledge) about sending illicit items via mail. Although, I live in a 'small' village and everybody knows the mailman. Maybe he was suspicious that all of the sudden I was receiving multiple packages a week from NL, UK, CA...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, I'll stop craving and being paranoid. It'll get here soon probably. I will laugh my ass off if I find it in the mail tomorrow.

    fuck man your in deep shit now!!!!!!!!!!!!
    <br/>
    just playing seriously.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its good to switch up addresses! especially if you get a bad feeling. and if you live in small town fucking right your post man could say he is getting alot of international orders....
    <br/>
    anyway i am sure it will come but get a back up address and rotate between the 2. or even us the other for a bit and then rotate,
    <br/>
    this way not all packages will go to the same address drawing attention!
    <br/>
    good luck

    If your items are still arriving, just late, then you have nothing to worry about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its probably just the vendors taking a little bit of time to post the items.

    Or it is very likely it is sitting at the post office for a while.
    <br/>
    They don't get suspicious from packages sent from everywhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Belgian orders through the internet is increasing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If there REALLY is something wrong,you'll get your customs letter:).
    <br/>
    But it's not like your adress will be getting "hot" like in the states:).
