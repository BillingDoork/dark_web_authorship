    How much is DCN postage on a 4x7 parcel?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Without DCN, I have always used 4 forever stamps ($1.80)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I put more stamps on, Will they process my DCN tag? How many more would I need?

    i think it is 80 cents if you pay with stamps for 1st class, but it is cheaper if you use priority or obtain dcn via web (not with stamps)
    <br/>
    hope this helps

    A little more info on using stamps to mail items would be appreciated. Can you mail priority or express with stamps?

    Yes you can use stamps to pay for a DCN and drop it off in a mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, make sure you can DCN what you are sending. Go to usps.com and "Calculate Postage" They will not do a DCN on most letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It has to be bigger than 4"x7"x.25" I think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you go though the system it will tell you exactly how much to postage to put on it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you get to the add on services at the end, if DCN is not available, you can not use it on the packaging you have selected.

    You can buy higher value stamps, like 80cent international type or even up to a $5.05, or 5.15, i can't remember.  These would work pretty good for priority packages.  you can buy those with cash and then use them later, don't buy and ship in same transaction though...
    <br/>
    Then just affix the green DCN to the package and you are good to go, but like jameslink said, dcn are not valid for smaller envelopes via first class, only packages.
