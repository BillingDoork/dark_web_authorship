    Does anyone have experience shipping cocaine direct from Colombia to the United States or any other country?  Any information on whether packages from Colombia to the United States are searched more often, and if so how much more often?  Direct from the source would obviously be a lot cheaper and therefore benefit us all!

    To have any long term success your going to need to change the composition of the cocaine before you try doing it. You cant just ship it as cocaine powder. Koltbiz is running into issues now after a successful batch of shipping. Read up on his thread.

    You would just dry it out I assume. But I am not sure that a dog cant just smell a liquid full of cocaine .. no ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The way I got it once was it was molded into this rubbery insert into a backpack. I had to cut the insert up into hundreds ( thousands ) of tiny pieces then let it soak in 99% alcohol for 36 hours. After that I removed the alcohol using a pot and the stove on a low heat and was left with a very thick paste which was entirely cocaine.

    I watched some document some time ago about coke smugglers who molded their product into china dishes  :D They were even able to apply some sort of glass like surface onto them.

    Without physically concealing cocaine, but instead just sealing it so that no smell escapes and making sure the packaging does not have any unusual characteristics.  What are the chances of the packages being searched by US customs?  Does anyone have any information on what percentage of packages from Colombia are searched?

    I did receive a sample from Koltbiz and it made it to the US in 26 days.  It does appear that he is having problems getting orders to some places now, but I think he successfully sent out orders for a while, until recently.  I would recommend shipping as a business letter, vs a package.  For the simple fact that it will attract less attention.  Any package coming from Columbia to the US or elsewhere is going to most likely be scrutenized more than many other countries unless they are also drug source countries.
    <br/>
    Kolt was talking about shipping from Argentina for a while, but think he dropped that idea.  I would recommend something along those lines as I have heard and tend to believe 'red flag' countries have a harder time getting stuff through than if they weren't on that list.  But, I would still conceal the coke in case the letter/ pkg is opened because if you don't it will be a definite seizure.  Try the business letters first and stick with that starting off.

    Damn coke from Colombia seems like you would have to be an illusionist to have long term success but i'm sure there are some pretty clever people out there. just seems tough

    That is a good question.  Maybe some Bulk shippers can chime in.  If it's all about the smell then the solution may already exist.

    Does anyone know typically how often random packages are pulled out for inspection?  Is there truly anything random or are there always something suspicious?

    From what I have heard which is apparently common knowledge around here is that big movers of cocaine bring it in on ships that are used a commercial ship and they just conceal it with the shipments in the most random compartments, does anyone in here have a ship lol? if someone had a huge ship used to import goods from other countries legally we could all make a killing but sadly I don't think anyone on here has the connections to bring it in that way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for mail I honestly would not want to risk it coming directly from the country source, if there was a reshipper maybe but that would raise the cost of cocaine since he has to pay the reshipper and then the question comes into play 'Will you pay more for extra security?'

    Wish I had a colombia, or peru direct connect :(
