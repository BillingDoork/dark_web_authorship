    So my situation is that I want to order an amount of a certain something that would look like its not for personal use. Its coming from OS and I won't have anything but small amounts and from domestic vendors sent to my real address. I've read over all the stuff about using PO boxes in fake names, setting up a fake mail box ect... all that shit seems really reckless imho. What I want to do is pick a house in a street that has little activity the time the post man comes, sit on the house in the days that the parcel is meant to arrive, when I see a parcel has been put into the box I nab that bitch. There are varies other details for safety, stealth and security measures but those don't need to be said. Getting the package if and once it is there is the easy part. My questions are, how can I assure the package won't need a signature (only a certain type of parcel and shipping method need signatures right?)? Is this a common method of receiving questionable amounts (there seems to be very little written on it)? And Is there a less finicky way that still has a lot of anonymity such as this way?

    Do you mean shipped to there community mailbox with the rest of there mail or shipped right to there front door? I'm assuming you meant there front door, so if that's the case, how would you know they wouldn't be home and just answer there door and they'd accept your delivery? Also your correct in the fact that only some packages require signature but in the cases it's not required the mail man won't always just leave the delivery there if no one answers, not unless you left a note requesting that but if you did the homes occupants may see the note as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if you wait at the house for the delivery in your car or something then run up to the mail man saying you live there and try to accept delivery he may ask for id or proof of residence. Not to mention doing that could get you caught up in a controlled delivery. Though if that happened you could try to say it actually wasn't your package you just saw the mail man and attempted to steal someone's delivery and wasn't aware of its contents, not sure if you'd get far with that though because they'd ask what you were doing on that street and having no answer will burn you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just seems like a lot of chances for something to go wrong and at the very least loose the package, and it sounds like it's going to be an expensive package which would hurt if lost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm just thinking out loud here.

    Most mailboxes that are just regular house boxes don't have any sort of lock on them. I think the idea would work well given the right setting.  Quiet town road for example with houses spaced well apart.  Lucky guy if that applies to you cause I'd be all over it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: To answer the OP's question, just talk to the seller.  Most packages that are sent on the Road never require a signature.

    It would look really sketchy for you to grab something out of someones mail box. Especially if you try to have your face hidden. Anyone around sees you and they might chase you or some-such drama. If you found a box that was so "rural" the houses in the area could not see their own mailboxes - long driveways on both sides of the street, lots of trees etc., I can imagine it could be pretty secure. To get it to go to the mailbox and not to the house? - small box delivered to a big mailbox by the USPS if usa. UPS, for instance is not allowed to deliver to people's USPS boxes, If I'm not mistaken. Such a rural area would be difficult to go unnoticed while hanging out waiting nearby. Maybe a telescope from a distant location, lol :-)  NWN

    Id say that I agree with NW Nugz. Although the person who owns the house may not be home, I assume there are neighbors etc who are pretty nosey. You may be able to use it once though.

    think this through again, read your original post. this is not a good idea unless you can afford to loose the btc, and you don't mind the possibility of federal charges for stealing mail. Nosy neighbors call the law regularly. and btw, what difference does it make if its 1 g or 28g, you don't know ANYTHING about it, and lets say that day there is a substitute delivery person and they don't want to leave a package so they instead leave a slip that says come to the post office to pick it up, then you have lost your order. You know that your address is good, you have received items there already. Just make sure your vendor uses stealth shipping and go with what works. Good luck

    if theres large amount and package doesn't fit through mailbox you can only pick it up at post office. also they might put some tracker device in package so you're not much safer than ordering to your home.

    Speaking from personal experience many years ago, it worked till it didn't....Don't risk it. After the homeowner caught on she took my mail inside and opened it, took some out- then I snuck in and snagged it. Never going to involve another residence/party again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only reason I didn't get popped was I think she liked the product : ) Nice surprise for her to be rolling face!

    It can be done but yeah like most others have stated, its very risky.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If there's hardly anyone at home during the day, etc, then do a dummy mail drop first.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean what if those residents have all their mail redirected to their own PO box?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If someone tried to use my mailbox for a drop, then i would receive their packages in my box and their left scratching their heads.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if you must, dummy drop first. Make sure letter box is large enough so it will accept the size of your package.
    <br/>
    If it is taken to the PO because of letter box size, then you've lost it, most likely the postal workers will know who those residents are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My people at my PO know me very well, hell i was walking past my post office to another shop when at closing time the guy who worked there said "Hey johnny, are you going to pick up your package? Sure enough it was an O/S SR order. :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if you have to, try the dummy drop first.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally i'd rather go to the trouble of getting a fake PO drop. If its burned, you walk away and do it again.

    I don't want to mention details and still won't. All but one of the issues that have been brought up I have already covered and can do something about the aforementioned issue. There is a lot of naysaying but do the naysayers know a better way? I bet a lot or even all of them only order for personal use and have never even thought about what may be required to get selling amounts. Obviously some situations to do with getting /drugs off the internet/! are going to be a bit iffy. Crime... is iffy. Even SR. Can someone PM me with some good info? I will also ask vendors though I doubt I'm going to get much of a response as they would get paranoid thinking I'm LE.

    I could see how this would work at a house that a older person lives at, or no one lives there and is up for rent .. I could get away with it a couple times where i am..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thing is though, What about when they go to drop the mail off and the name is not to ANYONE WHO LIVES AT that address? I guess if its close to your house you could put your name, sit on it and when mail man is way gone run up and get it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thing is, with tracking fucked up ATM how are u gonna know when it arrives? I had mail sent Friday got here Saturday but in the usps system it said it was not delivered til today and same with a international express pack i had sent, the track told me, they tried to deliver but no one was home to sign,because it was not drugs but hundreds of dollars owed to me, i called the  P O where i live cause track said it was there, they said 'NO WE DONT HAVE IT YET' and sure enuff the track was wrong the package came in a day later, but said it was at my  PO and tried to be giving to me..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if u get caught in someone elses mailbox =FEDERAL ISSUE..But if u send it in your name to their mail box, u could always say if asked, your looking for a Important package and it was not in your box so your just opening not going through ppls mail just seeing if your pack u know what it looks like is in there, and that u have gone through other ppls also..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dunno this is a tricky situation...But i would def put your middle name and last name on it... Or middle name and first name.. switch it up..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When i order Internation i use my middle name so i know itsa International pack..for US TO US i use my first..And iv been getting mail this way for years so its not weird ...What do u think about my idea?? To the Op?

    I don't know about the US but in Australia I can easily find out the first letter of the first name and whole last name of the person who lives in whatever house chosen. So thats not an issue. I will be sitting on the house (have it and the mail box in view) in the days it should arrive. If somethings has happened to it and it doesn't show then eh, I'd rather have security ordering large amounts and take the risk of it being late or missing.

    <br/>
    Your pplan is decent, But it depends on how big of a neighborhood u live in and how oftenthe house owners are home..and when they check their mail..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you wanna go all bad ass with it, i suggest u do some true investigation sit out down from there house and watch and see after the mail comes how fast they go get the mail,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do this a few days in a row after u know mail has come for that house, and see if they hae a pattern of checking their mail.. U r not taking much precations here bro, and what your wanting to do could easyly backfire...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    U dont have a grandma? or someone and say u wanna order a gif for your mom or dad or something, but need to get it sent to her house? Or a best friend, tell him u need to  get some video games sent or some bullshit,, but using some body mail box u dont know and sitting on it, not a full proof..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    U HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IT WILL BE THERE, TRACKING IS FUCKED RIGHT NOW, AND IF U R SEEN CHECKING IT AND SITTING down from the house for a weekand going to the mail box to see if it comes, someone will notice...

    Seems silly to me. Even for bulks amounts, you can plausibly deny (see what I did there?) that you ordered if you follow the basic safety procedures, which you obviously fucking should ordering international bulk. No drugs in your house, make sure there's no trace of SR on your computer, leave the package for a few days if you think anything happened. There's no way to prove you ordered anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT if you put your name and send it to another address and it gets intercepted or a CD gets set up and they go to deliver it to that address and find you strolling over to pick up a package that you (at that point) obviously knew was coming, WITH YOUR NAME ON IT, you're gonna be in some shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We can't tell you if you can do it successfully or not because none of us know what your street/neighborhood/neighbors are like. if you think your street are quiet enough and your neighbors mind their own business then go for it. but keep in mind the risk you're taking - especially with tracking, where the vendor will see that you addressed it wrong and most likely refuse to refund or reship (for good reason) and you'll be out a pretty chunk of btc. Just read up on security measures, ask the vendor/read reviews about his packaging, and receiving bulk packages and you'll be fine, I don't see any reason to try and jump through hoops like that. And, of course, don't fucking talk to the cops on miniscule chance that they do come a knockin.

    I didn't want to sent it to my address/name from O/S because I'm 80% I've been flagged. I had something pulled a few years back that was in a grey area and some research chemicals that were legal pulled too. So yeah. Hmm, yeah the 3 risks with doing it this way are the house being camped by LE, some crazy bastard chasing me down because he saw me take it (I have stealth to prevent that though, I would be looking like I'm doing a mail route, putting pamphlets in mail boxes whilst I'm on the way to the house then take the parcel out when putting the pamphlet in) which is still a random thing that could happen somehow and the last being someone describing what I look like and telling LE and by chance getting ID'ed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After reading peoples opinion I have decided even though if done correctly it could work alright that it is still too finicky, stressful and time consuming with a touch of wild card thrown in. I'm going to have to keep looking. Thanks guys &lt;3

    Well if you get caught you burned any deniability and your security measure could be used against you if it went to trial. It would actually help prove intent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I the only person who takes issue with the fact that you seem to have no problem putting someone else at risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hurt no one else and by all means do as you please.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if the the package is intercepted at the post office and the police decide to raid the house. An innocent family may have to live with the neighbors, family, and friends knowing they were raided. Even though they did nothing they will have to live with the stigma of it. It could even result in an arrest forcing someone to defend themselves against criminal charges.
    <br/>
    Police, prosecutors and judges overreach every day. With the amount you are talking about they just might stretch the law for a suspected dealer where they would not for personal use.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Overseas packages are very hard to predict. You can't possibly anticipate every thing that could go wrong and set up a counter measure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have the means to buy that much than why not just get a drop ship location?

    Honestly the more i think about this idea and now just read the above post about your risking a innocent family for your drugs because you have been flagged is fucked up and stupid!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DONT EVEN PURSUE THIS IDEA ANYMORE.. ITS STUPID AND IT COULD CAUSE A BAD CHAN REACTION OF EVENTS.  IF U HAVE $ LIKE THAT FFS PAY SOMEONE TO LET U SEND TO THEIR HOUSE..

    What happens if you're caught? If somebody notices you taking shit from their mailbox they wont be happy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A silly idea really. Why dont you just order to your own home, make sure there are no drugs/or your sr computer in your home and if the LE turn up deny you know anything about it. They cant do you without solid evidence.
