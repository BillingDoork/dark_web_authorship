    Well there we go. I have made 3 orders recently: 2 weeks ago from Netherlands, Over a week ago from Germany and about week ago from Czech Republic. Im from Scandinavia. Im bit worried that the first one has been caught by customs(even though no one has contacted me yet). I have made before this order to Germany and that was really fast. Is it possible that if customs have caught my NL order they are going to investigate all international mail i receive?

    I'm sorry, I just need to be completely honest, but when I first read the subject line I thought it said "Multiple orgasms".   :'(

    <br/>
    Yes. It's possible.  No, it's not likely that they saw one package and sent a message out to the entire country's worth of postal workers demanding a search for any international packages coming to you and do it quick because they probably ordered 3 at a time.  I'm sure it's possible, in any country, but more likely in some than others.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why are you worried one has been caught by customs if no one has contacted you?  Beyond the fact that SR gives us all a little anxiety, regardless of what we order.

    Sorry for misleading. Im sure disappointment was huge  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason i was worried because it's known in my country that orders from Netherlands are more in supervision than others. And vendor promised
    <br/>
    fast delivery or that is something he/she is known. Although there have been others who haven't received their order as well(from this vendor). Maybe im just "annoyed" because of long shipping times. I did choose these vendors because i thought they're fast. I just have hunch that there is problem, but i might be tripping balls out of nothing. Dunno...

    Get grounded.  Think about this from my perspective (not emotionally involved).  Here's what you know:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - You have packages that likely should have arrived by now.
    <br/>
    - They have not.
    <br/>
    - Your country is a generally risky/scrutinizing one.
    <br/>
    - On the other hand, you chose your vendors carefully so it's unlikely you got scammed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Three things can happen.  1. The packages all you show up tomorrow and you feel silly for worrying. 2. They got seized/lost and nothing LEO-related will happen.  This is a win-lose situation.  Your address may very well be flagged but it is far more important that you avoided any charges. 3. You've got a CD on your way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If either 1 or 2 happen you'll be grumpy and somewhat broke or happy, but it's all over.  The only thing you can do about any of it is make the 3rd option less painful.  So clean your room.  Hide or have friends hold paraphernalia for you, or drugs themselves, if you have any. Keep a clean shop.  If they search your house, make sure there's nothing to find.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't get me wrong - I do think you don't have anything to worry about.  But all I'm saying is the only actionable thing you can do regardless of which outcome is coming other than to just wait is to minimize the potential damage of option 3.  Then sit back, relax, drink a beer, (I'm jealous already, I'm in AA ...) and enjoy your day. There's nothing else you can do.

    Hi SR´s!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I´m not from scandiavia, but I´m from central eu and for sure 1 or more of my orders got seized. Til now I got no letter, no visit (and happy with this - of course!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had to take the loss, but I have got no other problems (hopefully not coming up)!
    <br/>
    That happend about 2 months ago...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ps: Do "they" send no letters anymore, or it was the small amount (1-2gr C)?

    I've been getting international letters (orders) quite a bit recently...  I have 2 more coming late next week or the week after.. I'm a bit worried that the customs might notice my address receiving a spree letters from many different parts of the world.. around a month..
