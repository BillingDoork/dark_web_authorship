    A few weeks ago I got a Foodsaver unit on sale (both for SR and legit food storing purposes), model 2244 I believe, one of the flat manual ones. I have not used it yet, and was considering returning it and paying the difference to get one of the more expensive 'upright' units (a model 3460 or better).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think? I initially got the cheaper one because it was one of the better 'manual' models and only has two modes (seal and vac+seal), I usually go for simple and these type of units have proven reliability with less parts to fail obviously. Although I have not tried it yet, the manual one seems like a lot less fuss. The built-in sealer material roll in the upper models will probably not be that useful as I would be making custom-sized pouches for various items or quantities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The 300X+ models have superfluous features like auto bag sensing (automatically seals/vacs when you insult bag), different vacuum speeds (for more delicate items), and moisture sensor (stronger seal for items with more moisture...why not just use the best possible seal regardless?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any opinions or comparisons would be great.

    depends on the volume you need. I own all three. seal-a-meal will do about 20 seals before overheating. and they are all sealed differently due to the bar temp, foodsaver is a little better, will do about 30. problem here is once it gets real hot, it won't vacuum down your bags anymore because the excess heat has sealed the bag just enough that the vac-channel won't let the air escape.....yeah, it pisses you off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now, if you want the very best for close to the same price. one called Orved (from italy) this thing will seal every bag in the house. every one sealed perfectly. and the vacuum pump will crush a beer can flat enough to mail as a letter....if you wanted it to.
    <br/>

    I found mine online at Tundra.com for like 250........retail is 499

    ChronicCrew have you seen the MVS 45 nitrogen flush sealer?Â  Way out of my league but it's the most expensive packaging system I've seen used to send herb.

    The 33xxx series Foodsaver are very crap for these uses. Don't get them. if you have low volume get the 2xxx series. everything else what Chronic said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    when you move up to good volume or want better then you need like a weston pro 2300 and go up from there. (the vacupack elite is better, the 2300 is a china knock off of the italian model). quality of your outer bag is more important then strength of your vacuum however for our purposes...
