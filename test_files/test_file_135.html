    This is mainly directed to my fellow Aussies -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm after some hash and as it is rare to see domestic listings I'm considering ordering international. Only after a small amount, probaby a 1/4 oz. max.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can't decide if it would be alright or a really bad idea to order something with such an odor from an international vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What does everyone think? What have peoples experiences with international hash been like (without too much detail please)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers guys.

    MATE.... Did ou really need to start a thread with "that word" in it? Aus, Aussie, Australia Oz...
    <br/>
    Why didnt you just jump in the current aus shipping thread and ask there?
    <br/>
    Plz keep threads with "that word" to a minimum...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You will understand why when you are no longer a noob.............

    Bob - I started a new thread as to not hijack someone elses. I feel this topic is a little different to the other Aus shipping one. The other is for vendor recommendations, and the origional "Aus shipping" ones no longer exist.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been lurking these forums for over a year, spending many hours every week reading everyones dribble on here so am far from a noob. Don't let the post count fool you. I just prefer to not announce my presence too often on a drug forum.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The info requested in very generic and I feel of no risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers Zulu. Anyone else?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: Bob - I do understand your annoyance with all the "Aussie", "Oz", etc. threads. I remember a time when there were half a dozen on the first page of Shipping alone. It was too much I agree, but after some thought I proceeded anyway as this is a little more of an interesting topic than "It's been 3 weeks. Where's my drugs?" or "How do I use PGP?".

    Hi guys,
    <br/>
    Just letting you know I will be listing hash today, shipping Aus to Aus. Sourced from overseas it is great quality with an amazing smell and taste. $100/7gs, $50/3.5gs. Don't get scammed by international vendors, I got your poison here. Cheers, Boyd.

    I recommend international vendors for everything except weed and hash.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had to packages in a row to different addresses not come through from a top seller - 5gms each.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only significant failure I have had in 15 months. Either I was scammed by a reputable vendor or AQIS found it.
