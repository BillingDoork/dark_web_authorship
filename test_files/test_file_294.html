    I'm curious, how do you have the cojones to do that, do you know your postman and look out the window? do you feel you could smell if something wasn't right? Or are you just throwing caution to the wind to get that big order.

    Order from reputable vendors who know what they are doing and it really isnt an issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also ... just because you dont sign for something, doenst mean you cant be charged/prosecuted. It gives you an out, but once they charge you for the package, they can then gather other evidence before trial that will trip ya up ( BTC load receipts, evidence found in your residence at the time etc )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alot of myths going around on here.

    yeah but signed and addressed to your good self I imagine is sufficient evidence all by itself. Someone correct me if I am wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I like the plausible deniability of having no other evidence which is certainly possible to attain with some work. But signed. Don't you look at the guy waiting for that signature, and wonder if this is it?

    Also.. just don't answer the door. In our experience the majority of mailmen will just leave the package/envelope anyway. It's not like they want to carry your shit any farther than they have to. Though, if they leave a note saying you need to pick it up or setup a redelivery... just go pick it up. It's not like they are going to post a policeman at the post office every open hour on the chance you'll stop by. This is real life... they have better shit to do; like eating donuts and hitting on pretty girls.

    aus mail system outsources freaking everything nowadays so, no, the mailman is often different - especially for stuff that needs a knock at the door vs just junk mail :(

    Signing for a package in no way proves that you know of it's contents, more and more retailers are using track and trace with their mailings so it's going to get more common in the future, I sign for lots of deliveries every day but it doesn't mean i know what's in them :)

    I ordered some stuff and it was trackable... It showed me that the package went into customs and never fucking left. And in about a week I got a controlled delivery. Good thing I just didn't open the door, and now the fucking cops are watching me.

    Were you getting a lot of stuff or just a small personal useage order? I cant imagine having the dreaded knock one day! but then again I only buy for personal use so its never reall over a quarter gram/gram of stuff usually coming in.

    Guys check out my thread "!Please Help! Big Customs Problem!" I've outlined the situation in more detail there. Its now been 4 days since they tried to fry my ass right in my fucking apartment. So far I'm OK. But I haven't been smoking anything or fucking with anyone that I know. Complete under the radar. It's really nerve wrecking man.... FUCK!
