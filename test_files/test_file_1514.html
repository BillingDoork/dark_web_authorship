    Does a list of this exist anywhere?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be useful if knowledge could be pooled to see which products are most frequently seized, to inform buyers to making better decisions, as well as to possibly catalyze vendors to develop new innovations in shipping technique.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And in the same vein, which destinations/origin points are most closely scrutinized? There is a lot of talk about this in the forums, but it is all very spread out.

    how about this formula for determining the probability of a product being seized (assuming it is illegal):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P(seizure) = 1 - 1/SKETCHY
    <br/>
    <br/>
    where SKETCHY = (mass) x (volume) x (how much the product smells) x (1 + number of international borders it will cross)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As SKETCHY approaches infinity, the probability of seizure approaches 100%

    + amphetamines and heroin. depending on where those dogs are used for what purpose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i guess other than that ... will be hard since not that common. dogs need to be retained and shit all the time

    I think coke is the #1. Observing peoples feedbacks it seems almost that 1/2 coke shipments get seized. Not sure why. Even the 1% vendors who never lose packages always seem to lose a few coke ones. I guess that just says something about the particle nature of cocaine.

    I have always assumed marijuana would be one of the more difficult things to ship as it seems like just about the stinkiest thing you would want to ship. Yet it seems like there are is a vast amount of weed being moved successfully.

    Well you have to consider Drug dogs can only be trained to smell 1 drug, or rather it is very hard to train them to smell multiple drugs. When dogs are stationed at various mail borders and what not they have to consider the most likely drug being trafficked... in which case cocaine/heroin are among the biggest concerns, coke probably coming first.

    I am quiet sure that MDMA is the most odored powder. So it is the most likely to be smelled by dogs.

    I would've always thought marijuana as well but it seems like the consensus is mdma/cocaine.  Interesting.
