    I've noticed on my last few orders that vendors are using USPS "Flat Rate" Boxes more and more which are priced for items weighing up to 70 lbs. I typically order bud so to put small amounts of bud/pills/anything into a flat rate box that barely weighs a pound seems like a bad idea to me. I could see using flat rate if you are buying huge quantity. But USPS also offers plain "Mailing Boxes" (free of charge - they just have to be shipped priority) that are exactly the same size as the "Medium Flat Rate" but come out to be much cheaper and then you just pay by weight. (USA I'm talking here.) I think it looks somewhat bad putting a q/p h/p etc into a flat rate box that is priced to hold 70 lbs. I don't care about pricing. This is more for stealth/security. I ordered a q/p and received it in a medium flat rate that weighed almost nothing. Just seemed like it would throw up a small flag to me being that the product was so light yet in a flat rate box. (Also the box was stamped Fragile by the post office and came to me beat to hell like someone pressed on it to see what it might have been.) USPS "Mailing Boxes" all day... or non USPS boxes all together are the way to go!!! Just my $0.02.

    Don't take this the wrong way, but it is clear that you don't vend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With out too many details I will say that flat rate boxes pay one price to ship.
    <br/>
    Which means you know how much it cost to ship before it ever does.
    <br/>
    Which means that if you do not use a flat rate box, then you have to take your package inside the PO and have them weigh it and pay them for it etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As opposed to being able to just drop it in a Blue Box in the middle of no where in the middle of the night.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A Flat Rate box holds UP TO 70lbs. Im sure the number of boxes holding anything even close to that is very small. I have often looked at the box and wondered "WTF could you even put in here that weighs 70lbs? lol.

    QP fits perfectly in a flat rate envelope. There was no need for the huge box. That I think is a mistake on vendors part. HPs are a different story.

    Actually, I have an answer for that: Nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or almost nothing, at least. The heaviest metal only hits 61 pounds in the dimensions of a small flat rate box. Bismuth is the heaviest metal that could legally be mailed though, as far as I can tell. You get about 26 pounds of bismuth in the dimensions of a small box. ... When you consider the physical size of those boxes, 26 pounds is actually extremely heavy.

    I do recall when I had the original thought of "WTF could I put in here that would weigh 70lbs" I actually did consult the periodic table of elements, well by consult I mean opened a webpage with the elements on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I didn't even consider metals that couldn't be legally mailed. Can't mail lead I assume. lol

    What I meant was that you put the box in an envelope. IMHO more layers of packaging the better in case it gets mangled in transit. Because QP triple sealed barely fits in the small box.

    Yes...it is very clear that i dont vend because I don't...I'm talking about the orders I RECEIVE... of course all the know it alls jumped on me. I was at the P.O. yesterday and asked the lady what can u possibly fit that weighs 70 lbs and she gave me an ENDLESS list. Gym weights was one big thing she said all the time, rolled change, all sorts of heavy metal products, multiple heavy glass candles, box filled to the max with super heavy books etc that just barely made the weight the limit. I honestly couldn't believe how many things she said she herself had just personally seen shipped that was super heavy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All I'm doing is adding a little TIP and I get jumped all over because my last 2 orders were obviously taken into a post office because they had the post office shipping label on them and the official post office Fragile stamp.... even though you can prob buy one online. Still would look a BIT SHADY if I were the postman....even if the vendor uses the "drop in the box" method. I get that. This was a tip. Thats all and the know it alls jump down my throat. Amazingggggg. You're welcome!!! Like I said in the orginal post "just my $0.02" ignore it or do shady ships... don't matter to me. Just thought I'd throw it out there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the envelope...I agree 100%. I got 2 ounces in an envelope once and it was beat to shit and literally almost open-able by the time it got from coast to coast and i ended up with a 1/4 oz. of shake.

    Not sure if I am one of those "know it alls that jumped down your throat" or not, but either way most vendors would consider your "tip" as putting them at risk. So when you post a thread IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS TO EVERY PERSON ON SR EVER! there is a good chance that new vendors could read it and take it as gospel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And that is not a good thing. Either way you have your answer. A small flat rate box with DCN is like $6.00 to ship. Your vendors have factored that into the price. No need to try to save them a couple bucks, I think they are OK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as your box being light; again no one from the shipping PO to your front door cares that it is light.Im sure they care much less then if it was heavy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you ever purchase anything from me I promise to include some FREE gym weights in your box, just mention offer code:

     And that is not a good thing. Either way you have your answer. A small flat rate box with DCN is like $6.00 to ship. Your vendors have factored that into the price. No need to try to save them a couple bucks, I think they are OK.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As far as your box being light; again no one from the shipping PO to your front door cares that it is light.Im sure they care much less then if it was heavy.

     If you ever purchase anything from me I promise to include some FREE gym weights in your box, just mention offer code:

    Lol Schroom....I'm not talking about the small flat rates...those r obviously gonna be light...im talking about getting a medium/large flat rate that weighs almost NOTHING.. I actually checked out your vendor page and may place an order from you. I'll be sure to put ILIKEHEAVYSHIT in the order. LOL....Just a TIP man... NOTHING ELSE....no GOSPEL...THIS IS JUST A TIP everyone. The vendors that use regular boxes/printed labels/ etc etc... You can also purchase a USPS shipping scale that will give you the exact cost. Once again JUST A TIP....the boxes I have received that are from bogus business return addys and are NOT USPS boxes come to me in literally PRISTINE condition. (My last order was a USPS Medium Flat Rate..it was pressed on like someone was trying to see what it was... and the corner was fucked up so bad it looked like you could easily fit a pen cam or sniffer tool in). How many vendors actually SEE what their product looks like after they ship other than the reviews that get posted? Prob not tooooo many. But thank god the vendor didn't just vac seal and throw in the box (like MOST do)...it was wrapped...platics...tapeddd...bubble wrapped...the whole 9 yards. JUST A TIP. Sorry for not posting that in my original topic!! I will remember that next time. Obviously you can see by my post amount I dont post much man. Just thought this was a good tip to vendors.

    Without anymore details; suffice it to say the name of your topic (being in all CAPS and all) makes it appear as gospel or something. you could have garnered more insight asking "Why?"

    This is a stupid thread.  No good vendor would ship product in a box that was unnecessarily large.  Since you don't vend and apparently either made this shit up, want to sound smart, or use idiots that ship in over-sized boxes, it is abundantly clear you  have NO idea what you are talking about.

    I've made multiple multiple orders of canna and the ones that come in unusually large and/or non-usps boxes all together but shipped via USPS come in pristine shape. USPS Boxes...usually beat to shit...So many of those USPS boxes they can always just open it and repack it if they really wanna see what's inside. Sorry this is so dumb. Everyone else i inquired too thanked me for the advice. Obviously vendors that can fit their products into tiny boxes have little to nothing to worry about. Wish I could have re-named the topic. Once again Schroom...sorry bro.

    Suffice it to say canna is not so much my thing. The local growers market is small and so prices are held high. There is no room to resell while paying the local market prices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plus there are a million canna vendors. no offense to them, but I would not want to fight my way into their jungle........ maybe some day.
