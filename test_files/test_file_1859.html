    I'm just wondering if anyone can give an indication on whether the London Olympics will be a good or bad thing for making shipments to the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking either:
    <br/>
    1. they'll increase customs security &amp; checks due to fears of bombs, etc when 'eyes of the world are on the UK'; or
    <br/>
    2. checks for post will decrease as everyone (dogs, people, etc)'s busy increasing security at airports (which we know's happening).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone have any thoughts - or even better knowledge?

    I'd stick with domestic vendors for the duration of the Olympics and vendors you know have discrete packaging if you want to order internationally. I ordered a large amount of 2C-B pills recently from a certain European country and they made it here today just fine :)

    I don't think there will be any problems. If there are any threats the relevant organizations already know about them and are probably the ones behind them. Things should run as usual.

    I really can't decide to risk a small order (1g) from netherlands to the UK because I have a larger order coming from brazil (2.5g) which won't arrive for a couple more weeks. I don't want to get my address to get flagged. What to do, what to do? Hmmm.

    Netherlands to UK will be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The increase in postal security for the Olympics is centered around terrorism and hence packages from outside Europe are getting scrutinized a lot more heavily, the Netherlands isn't exactly a hotbed of terrorism and so post from there isn't getting checked much more than usual.

    Yes, Im waiting over 2 weeks for a package (a reship as first never arrived) from Crystall Wife from within - to Europe (not UK though), starting to think itll never come.
    <br/>
    Also a package from DubG (from US) will have taken 19 days if it comes tomorrow. Past 2 orders with him came within 2 weeks.
    <br/>
    Hopefully just unusually slow mail for some reason....

    Yeah, according to the BBC, drugs trafficking isn't really a priority at the moment, most things are just passing by.

    ..i would disregard any BBC drugs forecast, they are intentionally provoking a response and are no doubt going to capitalise on the next drug bust to drive their "see told you so...unmanned customs...its a disgrace.."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    all a vicious circle all bollocks predicted it before its been printed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No reason why mail wont be processed any slower nor quicker than it does currently.
    <br/>
    the so called specialists manning the scanning machine are still there.
    <br/>
    I doubt the dogs assigned to customs have been moved on.
