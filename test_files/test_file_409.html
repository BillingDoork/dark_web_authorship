    We at SRX pride ourselves on timely deliveries with the best care taken to ensure stealth and the strongest likelihood of arrival. That being said, shipping from the middle of Canada to various parts of Australia are taking us dangerously close to resolution-ville.  We would prefer not to trouble staff with these resolutions, but as a newish vendor, we'd love to know: What are the average delivery times from N.America to NSW/Victoria/Melbourne/ etc.?  We would like to continue to serve this under-provided region, but funds just seem to sit there forever, while we sweat waiting for acknowledgment that our little care packages have arrived safely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

    Hey Smoothy,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anywhere between 4-21 days, 10-14 days on average.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had one order turn up 3 months later (only 1)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck with your shipping efforts to Australia!

    Out of the hundreds of packages i've had delivered from around the world (Ebay mainly), only ONE had ever been inspected (and still delivered) by customs, and it wasn't an illegal item.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All my deliveries have been within the alotted time frame given by the sender, holiday times, mothers day, easter etc... all encourage more mail, so longer delivery times, but (i think) slightly better delivery success rate.

    Vendors are getting complacent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact remains - if you improve your shipping methods and by doing so improve your success rates, you can use that as a selling point AND make more money at the same time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vac sealed LDPE is a joke.  It's permeable.  If you don't want dogs detecting anything, you need to have a final layer that has a permeability rate of 0.000x MTVR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, what you need is 1) goods in a ziploc bag.  2) Vac sealed HDPP layer.  3) NOT vac sealed foil/tyvek or foil/nylon layer.  Acetone wash after step 2.  Obviously the actual way you formulate the letter around that would have to be top shelf as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could charge 2-3 BTC's for 'super stealth' packaging for small amounts, and I can guarantee you 99.9% of your shipments would get through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm really disappointed that vendors aren't listening and aren't improving their methods.  In places where the street value of substances is super high (like in Au), if you go the extra mile, charge accordingly, you'd STILL come in at half the street cost and you'd own the overseas market within 6 months.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's a real opportunity for some vendors to step up, improve their game, and get more business through NOT sitting on their hands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LE isn't sitting still, and neither should the vendors here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MAKE IT SO!  ;D

    Abso-fucking-lutely, can someone +1 this guy please?

    <br/>
    When a letter comes through and I know what's in it because I can feel the shards through the envelope.... a miracle it made it really.
    <br/>
    I'm all for paying that bit extra for increased stealth. A CD case with '1st demo shots' or some other mundane phrase written in texta, along with some pdf printouts of random band bios, hotel expense sheets, cake recipes, movie reviews... just muddle that package up with distractions.

    Well said  Yowie, its not that hard to achieve excellence on the Road, a lot of vendors seem to have trouble with big picture long term gains from return custom, i am a bit older than some so my demographic not so common but from 1999 thru to 2008, i spent upwards of $180,000 pretty much exclusively on amphetamines, if the SR was here then, the vendor with the long term vision would have recieved my money and i would have been very happy for them to prosper.

    Our original question was only concerning the usual expected shipping times from Canada to Australia with general post mail, but we can turn this into a conversation about packaging if you wish.

    A non-stakes consulting partner of ours is a 15+yr veteran on Shin Bet.  We aren't going to go into all our methods, but there are really only 2 things you primarily need to concern yourself with when shipping contraband; Obfuscation, and Misdirection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Firstly. Misdirect.  Your packages should be relatively nondescript.  Not so obviously so that it looks like your smuggling porn in a brown paper bag, just very common looking.  Common packing materials, common addressing and postage schemes.  International packages have a higher incidence of inspection that domestic, so take every precaution to avoid being chosen as one of those "at random" extra inspections.  As proof of this concept send some mates xmas card from out of country filled with pizza coupons and love, but cover the envelope with Arabic script. It's going to be "randomly chosen."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly.  Obfuscate.  The first round of inspection is not K9 or electronic sniffers, it's x-ray.  Make your packages appear to be exactly what's supposed to be in the envelope.  Pills/crack rocks, GHB vials.. these are all very difficult to obfuscate.  If your pack is moved on to K9, acetone is a terrible way to clean scents off of materials, it's very reactive with a great many packing materials that may not be obvious to the naked eye/human nose.  Always stuff, pack, and tape using non-latex gloves, and clean the whole mess up with 99% isopropyl alcohol (rubbing or massage alcohol). If your product is hydrophyllic  like some powders, gentle heating to remove off gassing vapours is very useful  Being able to hide, what you want to conceal in plain sight will provide the surest delivery.

    If your shipping is as good as it sounds, that's awesome. If you can consistently get it through you will pick up many regular customers.

    I'm willing to give it a shot and see how the quality is. I'll place an order in the next few days when I stock up on BTC.

    Packaging is NOT the problem with shipping to down under.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's buyers scamming, and vendors then taking advantage of that and also scamming.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is all a crazy self-perpetuating myth with the scamming buyers and vendors feeding it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been on here for a long time and have some reputable vendors I order from again and again and again. And their packages come through EVERY time. Even from the NL and Germany. And some of their packaging is pretty basic. I'm talking literally nothing lost in more than 100 items mailed. I have some major European vendors who are very happy to keep shipping to me even though they've long since stopped officially selling to Australia and refuse to deal with anyone else. I guess I must be willing these packages to arrive through sheer mental power.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However every now and again I try out someone new, and some of them I receive and others "magically disappeared because the amazing Oz customs fairies took it".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This ONLY happens with vendors who then eventually turn out to have scammed, or selectively scammed Australian buyers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now unfortunately some Aussie buyers are taking advantage of this "it's hard to mail to Australia" BS and also claiming it didn't arrive so they can scam back some % refund or a reship or whatever. Seriously, why would you agree to a reship if you think customs took your package???? It's all BS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anycase - if everyone was honest there'd be no problems. But a large % of Australia (and I'm saying this as an otherwise proud Aussie) are filled with self-entitled dole bludging dishonest asshole dickwads who only think about themselves. And you can thank your fellow Aussies for ruining it for the rest of us.

    How true is this. Australians are good at fucking things up for everyone else. They seem to like to push the boundaries all the time. It's why Australia is heavily legislated and why when you walk around the major cities you have signs in caps telling you "YOU MUST DO THIS" "YOU MUST DO THAT" because quite frankly we cannot be trusted at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is always some loser with no redeeming qualities at all who fucks it up for everyone, always!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I love Australia but the HUGE rise of bogan (white trash, chavs, redkneck) culture in the past decade has made me dislike aussies so much.

    packaging needs to be looked at. some vendors dont switch up their packing methods until its to late.
    <br/>
    we need to stop this FE bullshit and take back some power!
    <br/>
    you look at the ice and mdma listings, some aussie vendors are in the top 3! and thats not domestic, thats best selling overall on SR. then you compare their price to the prices in .nl or .de and its jaw dropping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as said earlier, why some vendors have not seen this money making opportunity is beyond me.
    <br/>
    have specific sales just for aussies, have it at a premium, put in some fucking effort and pack that shit up correctly, and offer some sorta fall back in the case of lost orders.
    <br/>
    even at 6-7btc a gram your still doing very well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and to stop these scammers offer this service to aussies who have the stats. 10 or 20 orders minimum, spent atleast $2000 etc........
    <br/>
    <br/>
    to any buyer who is genuine, this will not be an issue
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ofcourse, at the end of the day, some vendors just cant be arsed with us, to much effort, and its money tied up for 2-3 weeks in transit, so its easier to just say 'yea man, i sent it' and collect some free btc.
    <br/>
    and ofcourse the bogans ruining it for us by scamming :/

    if you want to shoot me a PM i'd love to give u some pointers.. their all pretty obvious so you probably know them already, it fucking suprises me everytime when i get somethin and i can spot it from a mile away its a SR package.. some people just worry about volume of posting, and not about packaging..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would also suggest not sending 20+ letters to australia on the same day, from the same post box.. Limit your Australian customers to guys with excellent stats. 30+ transactions. not only will it stop you from getting scammed, it'll also limit the amount being sent thru customs at 1 time. I know theres a large volume coming thru customs, but come on, 100 packages exactly the same coming thru customs, must stick out a bit.

    Really?  You honestly think that Aussie buyers on here are ANY different to anywhere else?  What exactly are you basing this assumption on?  Last time you went to the Cross and watched a bunch of wasted bogans try and score?  It's the same everywhere mate, there are arseholes everywhere.

    I think it's in everyones best interests if you don't create a false stereotype and then reinforce it.

    Dunno man.

    <br/>
    Theres a lot of denial in Australian culture atm. There are two groups, the white aussies who cannot see the shit the rest of us can see becasue they never are exposed to it. Then there are the rest of us who can see the scum and shit that are bogans and the culture that is really being pushed in our faces to embrace.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perfect example was the issue with the french girl a few ,months back. A lot of us have seen that behavior first hand..but there were also a lot of non ethnics who claimed it as normal behavior you see in any country at anytime and there really isnt a problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australia has gone backwards with the rise and rise of the cashed up bogan culture. What was once a funny stereotype is in fact very real these days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And bogans are not your mick dundee types no more. The new age bogan is just white trash.

    Not really sure there is much to be gained from all this aussie bashing and stereotyping, as TheYowie said it is the same all over and every country has is elements that really encompass the less desirable facets of it culture. Look at the UK, fuck you think aussies are bad, you should try spending some time in an inner London borough and seeing how the some of the people there conduct themselves or how brits behave abroad on holiday, it's quite depressing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What has struck me on here is there seems to a disproportionate number of aussie related threads and posts that just reinforce the stereotypical image others have of us. There are good and bad everywhere, I really don't subscribe to the assertion we are any worse than others, we just seem to go about things in a less considered and informed manner.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I seriously doubt aussies are scamming anymore than other countries, I think that's just become an established 'fact' because it gets put out there and anything that gets repeated enough seems to gain legitimacy regardless of any verifiable facts. This then get's exploited and around and around we go.

    If you ask me, the long-standing situation on the ground here in AU, whereby we are systematically and massively raped on price for illegal drugs beyond all sanity and reason, logically means that the average Australian SR buyer is actually far LESS likely to scam sellers than our overseas counterparts who at least have access to vaguely reasonable domestic street prices.

    You don't need to be Einstein to work out that the opportunity to NOT PAY $400 for a fucking underweight gram of shit coke, is pretty damn awesome.

Not fucking me and not anyone else in this country with the slightest sense.

    It's all myths and stereotypes perpetuated and exploited by those who stand to gain from the whole sorry merry-go-round. It's up to us to do what we can to break the vicious circle.

        I seriously doubt aussies are scamming anymore than other countries, I think that's just become an established 'fact' because it gets put out there and anything that gets repeated enough seems to gain legitimacy regardless of any verifiable facts.

       If you ask me, the long-standing situation on the ground here in AU, whereby we are systematically and massively raped on price for illegal drugs beyond all sanity and reason, logically means that the average Australian SR buyer is actually far LESS likely to scam sellers than our overseas counterparts who at least have access to vaguely reasonable domestic street prices.

       You don't need to be Einstein to work out that the opportunity to NOT PAY $400 for a fucking underweight gram of shit coke, is pretty damn awesome.

     Anycase - if everyone was honest there'd be no problems. But a large % of Australia (and I'm saying this as an otherwise proud Aussie) are filled with self-entitled dole bludging dishonest asshole dickwads who only think about themselves.

    Maybe that happens. Maybe not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a fair point and an obvious tactic, but it does not ring true to me. Employing this tactic on a scale that would actually make a quantifiable difference would involve spending and "losing" fairly hefty amounts of real money each time they only get a % refund on a non-delivery. LE can't make fake bitcoins anymore than anyone else can. In fact they're probably the last people who could do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the laws of bureaucratic logic which govern spending real money, the powers that be would want to see quantifiable results for dropping sizable amounts of dough, something I'm not sure their underlings could provide. And that's assuming the chiefs even understand the nature of the beast, which is not particularly likely given that in matters of a technical nature our governing bodies generally seem to be about a decade behind everybody else. I think we give them far more credit than they deserve.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I reckon a disinformation campaign on the forums is about as far LE could or would go.

        Not really sure there is much to be gained from all this aussie bashing and stereotyping, as TheYowie said it is the same all over and every country has is elements that really encompass the less desirable facets of it culture. Look at the UK, fuck you think aussies are bad, you should try spending some time in an inner London borough and seeing how the some of the people there conduct themselves or how brits behave abroad on holiday, it's quite depressing.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        What has struck me on here is there seems to a disproportionate number of aussie related threads and posts that just reinforce the stereotypical image others have of us. There are good and bad everywhere, I really don't subscribe to the assertion we are any worse than others, we just seem to go about things in a less considered and informed manner.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I seriously doubt aussies are scamming anymore than other countries, I think that's just become an established 'fact' because it gets put out there and anything that gets repeated enough seems to gain legitimacy regardless of any verifiable facts. This then get's exploited and around and around we go.

       If you ask me, the long-standing situation on the ground here in AU, whereby we are systematically and massively raped on price for illegal drugs beyond all sanity and reason, logically means that the average Australian SR buyer is actually far LESS likely to scam sellers than our overseas counterparts who at least have access to vaguely reasonable domestic street prices.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You don't need to be Einstein to work out that the opportunity to NOT PAY $400 for a fucking underweight gram of shit coke, is pretty damn awesome. The vast majority of us are simply over-joyed to even have this opportunity. Who in their right mind is going to rock that boat?!? Not fucking me and not anyone else in this country with the slightest sense.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's all myths and stereotypes perpetuated and exploited by those who stand to gain from the whole sorry merry-go-round. It's up to us to do what we can to break the vicious circle.

      Don't forget the fact that LE are playing their part in undermining SR by ordering and claiming non delivery, that could have a lot to do with the rep of Aussies on here.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      that's a tactic that LE have admitted to using in a local news paper.

     Maybe that happens. Maybe not.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's a fair point and an obvious tactic, but it does not ring true to me. Employing this tactic on a scale that would actually make a quantifiable difference would involve spending and "losing" fairly hefty amounts of real money each time they only get a % refund on a non-delivery. LE can't make fake bitcoins anymore than anyone else can. In fact they're probably the last people who could do it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     By the laws of bureaucratic logic which govern spending real money, the powers that be would want to see quantifiable results for dropping sizable amounts of dough, something I'm not sure their underlings could provide. And that's assuming the chiefs even understand the nature of the beast, which is not particularly likely given that in matters of a technical nature our governing bodies generally seem to be about a decade behind everybody else. I think we give them far more credit than they deserve.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I reckon a disinformation campaign on the forums is about as far LE could or would go.

    To answer the original question that started this thread, I placed my first order from CAN 3 weeks ago today and have not received it yet.  Have received two other orders placed with a day or so of that one from UK and one from somewhere else (not EU).  So at this time of the year at least, looks like it can take 3+ weeks?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note to The Yowie and samesamebutdifferent:  You guys seem to be amongst the most level headed on here, i enjoy your posts across different threads and would +1 you both if i knew how.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All up though, I find this thread a bit disheartening and verging on masochistic.  Rather than using the forums to beat up on everyone and everything we don't like in our country we should be just sharing info that helps each other participate in this global community safely and successfully.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although I have only been ordering on the Road for about one month, I am hoping to continue with small orders every month or two until one or two 'go missing', then game over... and who will ever know whether I got scammed or LE got lucky, but what the fuck, it doesn't matter at that point.  I will just be grateful that I got to experience some quality gear at sensible prices and will then go back to buying inconsistent shit from unreliable 'dealers'... which is a lot like being scammed anyway isn't it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Something you cant buy on SR is respect and trust... and that's what we need to keep this game going!  Who gives a fuck about the bogans, we all got em in our neighborhood.

    Our experience is an average of 12-14 days from mid-Canada to NSW.  It's as nerve wracking for us as the vendor as you the buyer watching the time tick by and the escrow fund grow ever larger.  Even while hedged by SR, we never know what kind of shit-storm we are going to move our BTC into once we start rolling coins through our own launder-o-mat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This should never have degenerated into character assassination of Aussie vs. Aussie. vs. Kiwi. We love all you guys and girls.  We just wanted to be sure we were providing the best product we could offer in the timeliest manner possible.  We find the distance and lack of quick communication does not allow us to address buyer issues before they become a problem for us.  In light of a recent poor review, and without any redress through long protracted sharing of test results, we've elected to eliminate Oceania from .our destination options until a more reliable means of shipping/communication is available that is safe for user AND vendor.  Nobody is going to want to pay the $90USD for Fedex or DHL expedited delivery for single grams.
    <br/>
    We hope our other vendor brethren can otherwise fill the void left by our product.

    It costs $90 USD to ship 3 day from Canada to AUS via Fedex.  If that was truly an option, how many of you would pay it. The largest amount we would send at one time would be an OZ. You would have to pay shipping and half of total weight up front.

    How can it be speculation? Its what i've been reading. So in turn its an educated response due to reading a lot of vendors thoughts on australia.
    <br/>
    How can it be baseless? What i've said is BASED on the fact that a majority of australians are scammers.

    Its not constantly blurting out anything, dont you read? Pointless speculation? Seriously dude? Your making us all look bad right now.

     How can it be baseless? What i've said is BASED on the fact that a majority of australians are scammers.

    Eh?  I got the report.  It's about 30 pages long. Of course, it's speculation in that I don't know if they actually put the recommendations into action.

    Yeah that's my point, AU customs have to go in to scrutinize, private companies are not going to have dogs and fancy scanners, sure they will inspect obviously suspect items but as a general rule why would they giver a fuck, they are a shipping company. Unless AU customs are there every day I reckon private companies must be an easier proposition... all just speculation of course  :P

    What a load of bullshit!!  ??? What FACTS have you based your opinion on?  ??? Theophilus is 100% correct in his post to you jnemonic. Before posting a comment about Customs, especially in a country you don't reside in, think before you write. Speaking from personal experience is one thing but mis-information, speculation, rumor and innuendo are influencing the decisions upon which countries some buyers purchase their gear from. I for one have received all my packages from Canada.

    Whoa chill out why dont you? My opinion, which all it was, was from the negative reviews i've read thats all.
    <br/>
    This is a forum, people are allowed to express their own opinion. Yeah i admit, i should have thought more before i posted that, fair enough.
    <br/>
    Just sick of hearing of aussies being ripped off and receiving what they have paid for.
    <br/>
    Its not rumor, innuendo, or speculation, just saying if your buying from O/S just be prepared.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But hey congrats to you wadozo on receiving everything from there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last thing i want is some bullshit keyboard slanging match over shipping and customs, if i deserved it, then no problem, i'll happily take that on the chin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway...good luck to everyone.

      Anycase - if everyone was honest there'd be no problems. But a large % of Australia (and I'm saying this as an otherwise proud Aussie) are filled with self-entitled dole bludging dishonest asshole dickwads who only think about themselves. And you can thank your fellow Aussies for ruining it for the rest of us.
