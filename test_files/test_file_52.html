    hi,  just wondering, hypothetically.. if I ordered a fairly large order (around 100g) of a certain substance whether it be coke/mdma etc and i believe that the package has been intercepted and the package was addressed to me at my house. What precautions should I take to ensure I dont get into any big trouble? also, what would i say or do ? vague question but very curious

    If you receive a seizure letter, just shred or burn it and pretend it never happened. Eat the loss and move on. More than likely you won't be pursued by law enforcement. If you are, they will most likely attempt to deliver the package as you expected it to be. Then shortly after arrest you for trafficking it. If you're sure that's the case, don't ever accept the package. If asked, say you aren't expecting any packages, it must be a mistaken address. As long as they can't prove you conspired to do so through other methods(computer forensics, etc.).

    There are literally dozens of threads on here regarding what you should do (or not) in the case of an intercept, do some reading and educate yourself before starting new ones.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also to the person who said customs / LE wouldn't follow up on a 100g seizure can you please evidence that claim because that is seriously reckless advice!! If you are making bulk orders you should have invested the time effort and energy is securing a safe drop, not your fucking home address!! It is true small seizures and probably even some larger ones do not get followed up on but to say it is safe to order 100g to your home address is scandalous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advise would be ORDER NOTHING until you have done heaps of research on everything SR related from bitcoin to PGP then come back and navigate this site as safely as it can be done.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that helps.

    You couldn't be more right mate. As a rule of thumb that i'm comfortable following: 10g or less you can order to a home address. Anything above either try splitting the order up over the course of a month and stockpile the shit. Don't get greedy and reckless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to place an order like 100g then you should be able to afford to invest in a safe drop and cover the cost in the margin you make when selling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Put yourself in the shoes of LE, what is the minimum amount they would consider before considering knocking on your door, then play the risk/reward game I.e. what amount are you prepared to order that will make the risk justifiable?
