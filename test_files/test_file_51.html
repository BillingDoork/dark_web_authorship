    How's the success rate of ordering weed from SR? Does it normally cause any suspicion or does it go through like any other mail?
    <br/>
    I have ordered MDMA, pills, and RCs but for some reason weed makes me a little more paranoid.
    <br/>
    How easy / difficult is it to get through customs? I am in a third world country in Asia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Advice and comments would be appreciated. Thank you SR.

    You have to consider the fact that if you are living in a third world country, your customs won't have the type of budget as the customs have in western or other high-income nations. Your nations customs might not be able to afford any dogs at all, depending on how poor your country actually is. I wouldn't worry about it as long as you're ordering packages of weed under 100g. If you're planning to order more than a 100g then I don't know, but I'm sure other people have done it successfully.

    Depends heavily on what country you are shipping to, and their international mail volume, particularly in regards to the origin country. Some will be scrutinized more than others(orders from south america/netherlands/etc.). The main thing is that in blends in with the other masses of mail and doesn't draw any attention to itself. Of course it needs to be scent free. Double vac sealed preferably. Also, if shipping bud international, that's alot more time to allow for scent to permeate the plastic bags. I feel comfortable doing domestic USA if I receive it within a week or so, any longer than that, I would be concerned with scent.
