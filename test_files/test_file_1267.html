    Does keeping the pills in the sealed blister packs...as they come from the pharmacy... improve the chances of getting through...?

    I have never heard of a dog being trained to find benzo's. People with no insurance legally and illegally order prescriptions from overseas all of the time. Unless you order a crazy amount the worst case scenario is that you receive a love letter from customs asking for a script and in that case you trash it.

    <br/>
    I have got the foil packs just fine but I would say its better to not send them with the foil.

    Thanks Spartan...when you say you got the foil packs...do you mean the blister packs as they come out of the pharmacy package...?...can you describe how the packs were concealed inside the envelope...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    why do you say it is better to send without the foil packs...?

    Yes, blister packs. Taped together and sandwiched between thin cardboard/poster board. It looks like a plain letter when done. I imagine the foil my cause a second look if x-rayed but I'm not sure the foil is enough to matter.  I've never had an issue with pills only ampules or viles. I've seen carbon paper used but I'm not sure if was to prevent or see if there was tampering or if it helped shield the contents. That was y

    Pack one up and test it out if it makes lots of noise put a customs declaration 'Rattlesnake tail'.  :D I was just trying to answer the K9 question and give my opinion that benzo's in the mail are not a big deal. Good luck in your venture
