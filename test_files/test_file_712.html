    You should be able to use a utility bill as your second form of identification. Your primary ID needs to have your photo on it, so you can use your driver's license, college ID, or passport.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your voter registration card, or insurance card should also work as your secondary ID, should you opt not to use the utility bill.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a caveat, a PO box issued in your real name theoretically doesn't offer any added security, just the convenience of having your mail signed for and held.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could also consider renting a box at a UPS store or other retail shipping location. This would give you the added benefit of being able to accept FedEx, UPS, and DHL packages in addition to just mail. These stores also typically have a privacy policy that prohibits them from sharing information with law enforcement, unless they are subpoenaed, which could be viewed as an added layer of protection versus a typical post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Being pleasant and friendly when you're setting up the box and picking up packages will help you maintain a good rapport with the employees, which is always helpful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helps.  :)

    Great info thank you so much.  Wish I could give you karma.

    I didn't realize UPS has PO boxes, will it be more expensive than USPS?

    UPS stores and other retail shipping locations do typically charge more than a USPS P.O. Box, but in my opinion the benefits are worth the costs.
