    I am going to Tokyo next week, and I read people getting stuff shipped to hotels. So that's what I did.
    <br/>
    Well, the more I look online, I find people who have been busted for small things like 1 gram of 2C-I or half a gram of bud. I ordered 2g of speed &amp; a sheet (100x tabs) of 25i, and now I'm shitting myself. Anyone know how strict customs are, other buyers in Japan, etc? Or am I totally fucked?

    Thanks guys haha. Yeah I saw the customs page before that's why I thought I'd be better off getting it mailed than bringing it through the airport. Guess it wasn't too smart to have two separate orders of drugs from European countries..... Looks like I'm either tripping balls next week, or sleeping in a Japanese prison. :-X Wish me luck

    I lived in Japan for a year or so and they do not look kindly on drug use of any kind - I once managed to buy a gram of the saddest looking weed for about £70 while I was there, it was so hard to find anyone that would even discuss drug use. However, for some reason magic mushrooms were totally legal back then (2003) and I had the best trip of my life in the temples of Nara! I think that's all changed now..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think that you should be OK as even if one or both get caught in customs I don't think they currently have the police man-power to deal with a visitor, they tend to care most about coke and weed (most of the drug related police force are taken up with dealing with the Yakuza). If the worst happens deny everything and stick to it, nothing good can ever come from owning up there, only long prison terms. When you collect the post at least appear surprised, don't ask if anything has arrived for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Japan is a bit like being on drugs even when you aren't, so make sure you take it easy. You don't want to get stopped acting weirdly, head for temples rather than the madness of the inner city if you can - honestly one of the best experiences of my life was tripping through endless temples. Good luck man, you'll have a wicked time, let us know how it goes.

    Frow what I know foreigners caught with any amount of drugs in Japan don't go to prison, but are banned to life from Japan. Si if you get caught, it will just be the end of your vacation but won't spend long years in prison as you would in Cambodge or Thailand or I don't know what other Asian country.

    Cool thanks for the insight!
    <br/>
    Yeah, I heard about shrooms and RCs that used to be sold openly. Now my friends there say there's something called "Herb" going around? From what I've read, it sounds a lot like spice.
    <br/>
    I will definitely try to get outside of Tokyo too. Hoping to go to the temples in Koto.

    My friend there has said to me that amphs (mostly meth) is more common than even weed. Not that easy to find, but still the most popular.

    Good to know that it's not likely I'll be put in prison lol, but I'd still hate to never be allowed in Japan again!

      I lived in Japan for a year or so and they do not look kindly on drug use of any kind - I once managed to buy a gram of the saddest looking weed for about £70 while I was there, it was so hard to find anyone that would even discuss drug use. However, for some reason magic mushrooms were totally legal back then (2003) and I had the best trip of my life in the temples of Nara! I think that's all changed now..
      <br/>

      I think that you should be OK as even if one or both get caught in customs I don't think they currently have the police man-power to deal with a visitor, they tend to care most about coke and weed (most of the drug related police force are taken up with dealing with the Yakuza). If the worst happens deny everything and stick to it, nothing good can ever come from owning up there, only long prison terms. When you collect the post at least appear surprised, don't ask if anything has arrived for you.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Japan is a bit like being on drugs even when you aren't, so make sure you take it easy. You don't want to get stopped acting weirdly, head for temples rather than the madness of the inner city if you can - honestly one of the best experiences of my life was tripping through endless temples. Good luck man, you'll have a wicked time, let us know how it goes.

     Cool thanks for the insight!
     <br/>
     Yeah, I heard about shrooms and RCs that used to be sold openly. Now my friends there say there's something called "Herb" going around? From what I've read, it sounds a lot like spice.
     <br/>
     I will definitely try to get outside of Tokyo too. Hoping to go to the temples in Koto.

     My friend there has said to me that amphs (mostly meth) is more common than even weed. Not that easy to find, but still the most popular.

     Good to know that it's not likely I'll be put in prison lol, but I'd still hate to never be allowed in Japan again!

    I lived in Japan for quite some time, with my wife who was a US service member. First off, YOU WILL GO TO PRISON if you're caught with drugs or importing drugs into Japan. To think otherwise is naive. Just google "military spouse pot japan". I just left Japan in December 2012, and I was already a member of SR, and even tried ordering 1/8th of pot, and spoke with the vendor and requested the tightest stealth he could manage, of course I paid extra, but I really wanted to smoke! Anyhow, I had my mailbox at the PO, and I also knew the combo(these boxes had combo locks that I've never seen before) to another box that was erroneously issued to me upon my arrival. So I was basically given a drop box, not linked to me. So, that being said, my order was seized by Japanese customs, and the only reason I wasnt incarcerated is because they thought the pack was intended for the true owner of the other box. The only way to really import via SR or another similar method, is to ship using Japanese carriers, and ship to Japanese addresses, with labels printed in Japanese. Trust me, it's the only way. Mail coming internationally to foreigners, particularly Americans/Europeans, is scrutinized much more thoroughly. I won't say how I know this, but please, if you want to stay free, take my advice. Their are alot of japanese express companies, you will see them all over delivering things from door to door. You must learn how to write your name and address in Japanese, THIS IS CRITICAL!!! You don't want the customs inspectors to be able to take one look at your package and know you're an American, or other foreigner.
    <br/>
    Edit: As to how I knew my pack was seized, I performed some counter-surveillance from a safe distance each day around mail delivery time, and on the day i was expecting delivery, the police arrived with drug dogs to the PO.

    By the way, anyone that is ordering to a regular RESIDENTIAL address in Japan needs to know that Japan has a national system of registering residents to addresses. That means that if you send to a persons' house, the mailman has discretion on whether to deliver it or not.

    For an office building or hotel, it doesn't matter.

    i know of someone who got incarcerated there for 100 ecstacy pills they caught him as he was getting off the plane at customs at the airport. I think he was sentenced to 2 years in jail but he got out after 11 months or so, but they charged him with intent to sell and all that. Not trying to scare you, but just want people to be careful about drugs in japan, they take it very seriously over there..

     Sorry I could not give you all a more exciting story about how I got locked up and sit in solitary confinement for 2 years eating instant ramen. But I can tell you I'll be having a good ass weekend  ;D

     I still think this will be the last time I order drugs to a foreign country without researching their penalties and whatnot though hahah

    Thank fuck for that! glad it all worked out ok, but please next time you decide to order to a foreign country try to chose one with easier customs and less draconian drug laws  ;) I do not want to be reading a thread by you asking about shipping to Dubai ok!!

     My order arrived safely in Japan without problem. They even added a couple of extra pills. I imagine this was because the price in Bitcoin had fallen and they kindly were considerate enough to make up the difference with additional product. Thanks koptevo(99). I'll be doing business with them again for sure.
