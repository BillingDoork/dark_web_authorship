    I think this is how I would picture Beavis and Butthead as drug dealers.  Repeatedly mailing huge quantities of pot from the same post offices... sheesh.  Anyway, goes to show that being paranoid over stealth is worth it.  These guys weren't careful and made a lot of money for a long time, but their carelessness caught up with them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I must say I like the comments to the article - almost all are griping about wasting LE resources.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CLEARNET:  http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/may/30/pot-distribution-ring-busted-pacific-beach/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PACIFIC BEACH — Three Pacific Beach men suspected of using the U.S. Postal Service to ship marijuana to customers around the country were arrested this week and are expected to face trafficking charges Friday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Accused ringleaders Chris and Kyle Gillen, ages 24 and 25, and Matthew Schneider, 28, were taken into custody Wednesday at their neighboring homes on La Jolla Boulevard near Loring Street about 8 a.m., Chula Vista police Lt. Lon Turner said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The raid was the result of a yearlong investigation by the postal service and the Southwest Border Anti-Money Laundering Unit, a multiagency task force headed up by Chula Vista police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Officers discovered 300 pot plants that were being grown inside a Midway District warehouse on Gaines Street and seized some $500,000 in assets that included investment accounts, $35,000 in cash, several cars, an SKS rifle, a shotgun and a handgun, Turner said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The trio is accused of sending 10 to 20 pounds of pot through the mail each week to dozens of customers in New Jersey, Texas, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, West Virginia, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania, in exchange for cash, Turner said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He said the operation was bringing in an estimated $20,000 to $30,000 a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The postal service tipped off the task force to the shipments, spurring further investigation. The task force is made up of police officers from Chula Vista, National City and San Diego, as well as San Diego County sheriff’s deputies and district attorney personnel from San Diego and Imperial counties. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI also support the task force.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Turner said the probe continues and that there are likely co-conspirators.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Correction
    <br/>
    Based on incorrect information provided by police, the original version of this story said that one of the two pit bulls shot by law officers had to be euthanized. The dog is in very serious condition at the county animal shelter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When officers served the warrants in Pacific Beach, they were charged by two pit bulls, Turner said. Both animals were shot, and one is in "very serious condition" at the county animal shelter, he said. One of the men armed himself when officers arrived but surrendered without incident.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The men are facing several charges including selling and transporting marijuana, money laundering, and conspiracy. They were booked into jail where they are each being held on $200,000 bail. They are scheduled to be arraigned Friday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This would not be Kyle Gillen’s first marijuana business venture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The eldest brother began selling drugs in 2007, overseeing and financing another dealer’s distribution of everything from cocaine and ecstasy to mushrooms and acid, according to state court records. Gillen also worked at a La Jolla sporting goods store at the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Gillen and the dealer then set up a marijuana growing operation in a Miramar warehouse, hoping to use their medical marijuana permits to grow the plants and then sell them to dispensaries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Gillen put up $3,000 to fund the operation, but within a month all but five plants had died. They closed down the operation. Apparently upset about the failing venture, his business partner went to Gillen’s apartment and stole some items, including pot plants and a television.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Gillen was at work at the time, but his younger brother, Chris, had just moved from New Jersey days earlier and was at the apartment. Chris was beaten and restrained with duct tape during the robbery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Both brothers testified against the business partner in the robbery trial, court records show.

    We're you one of the officers in on this investigation or are you a psychic?  It doesn't say anything about "the same post office" anywhere in the article.
