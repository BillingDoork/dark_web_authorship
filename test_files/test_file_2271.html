    Okay so i realize that shipping to a house for sale is generally considered a bad idea but i don't completely buy it. When my buddy was selling his house he would receive mail all the time. Even after someone buys a new home its not uncommon for the buyers to receive mail directed to the previous owners. People on SR seem to not like sending mail to empty house because it would seem "suspicious" but i think this might be exaggerated. Mail men aren't detectives and if the names of the package recipient and owners of the house match up who are they to question the legitimacy of the contents of the package. Sending mail to a house for sale also allows for complete anonymity while other methods involve putting your identity out in the open. Now granted the negative aspect of this method is having to pick up the package at a house that isn't yours but after that is done you would have left no trace for police to find you. Please let me know what you think!

    So you all ready know what people on SR think but you are asking again?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you want people to encourage you toward your stupid idea, or do you want to convince them to do the same?

    No, i was looking for discussion so that if im overlooking something it can be brought to my attention. Im very honestly asking what the flaws in what I stated above because i want to stay safe. People say that sending packages to house for sale is unsafe but the way i see its one the safer routes but its very likely that I am incorrect so im putting it out there so someone will correct me if i am.

    Previous owners/tenets tend to put in a forwarding address which means that your package would automatically be forwarded to them and you would never see it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is what you are missing. If the how has been vacant too long then it will be marked as vacant at the post office and may be returned to sender with "Forwarding address expired"

    i live in a rented apartment, and my landlord has specifically told me that his mails will be coming to this apartment.
    <br/>
    so no forwarding address :D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    would it be safe for me to order in his name then? his nameplate is on the door, and   even if i have to take a package for him and sign for it, it still isnt in my name. and he doesnt need to know that a package arrived at all...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what do you guys think?

    I think you should all man up and have some faith in PGP and in the apathy of postal workers, who deliver thousands of small packages a day, who even if they did suspect anything wouldnt be worth thier just above minimum wage time...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can always have your packages addressed to a previous occupier whose mail still keeps coming through the door - bear in mind even if its your name on the package theres no way they can prove you ordered it (unless you leave the SR loaded on your shopping basket....)

    I completely agree. But a package addressed to a person other than me, gives me additional layer of security.

    It's not a stupid idea at all.  Having pkgs delivered to abandoned or vacant properties is one of the few truly anonymous ways to receive mail and has been done successfully for years by some people.

    These last 2 comments are all about the dumb leading the ignorant!  While it may work for 1 or 2 people here &amp; there where the postal workers don't care or are very observant, it is irresponsible to give these ideas out to noobs.  90% of the time when we have a package not get delivered it is because some noob reads some shit like this &amp; figures that they can try something like this to give them "added security, or anonymity,  without trying sending out half a dozen previous packages to make sure each one gets there . . .  or they decide to use a different name, &amp; then they put the transaction into resolution because they didn't get it.  And then the vendor has to pay the price for idiots posting shit in the forums like this!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to try something other than using your own name @ your address, do everyone a favor and send at least 6-10 different packages to yourself before you start screwing the SR vendors with something that you can't guarantee will work.  Even then, all it takes is your postal worker to retire, or move to a different route, &amp; the next one may not let things work how you expect, so just use the name that they will recognize as the same one that is on the bills that are delivered to your house, &amp; there will be no problems with deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are scared of something in your name, use a bogus name "In care of"  and then use your name . . .
