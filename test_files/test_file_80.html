    I'm going to be travelling to another state, and I need to take some MDMA, 2C-B, and probably a few joints.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's the best practice for getting it to this other state? Carry on, checked, or I was even thinking of shipping it somewhere ahead of time. Thoughts?

    Powders - Empty vitamin caps and put them in bottom of bottle and fill the rest with standard caps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Joints - Dont pre roll them, grind your weed and if you can vac seal twice flat. put it in between a book in you main luggage.

    really you could just put it anywhere, if they pull ya up for a luggage inspection, if its hidden well you will be right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but if they do a swab on your luggage and test it, they will go through everything to find it.

    The swabbing they do at the airport is not for drugs at all, it is for checking for trace amounts of substances used to make explosives. Same goes with drug dogs. I've smoked joints right before going into the airport and have had my hands swabbed for setting of metal detectors. Same goes with dogs at airports they are for safety not to catch drugs. TSA can't even catch guns in luggage half the time let alone anything else. Plenty of news articles and anecdotes of people forgetting guns in their bags and traveling fine.

    Stick it all in a couple of knotted condoms and slide it up your arse. I'm serious. However, there's a possibility your body warmth might evaporate the powder.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my advice is.... ship it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless you're a very cool calm type and haven't done it loads of times if you break out in a sweat at the gates you'll get collared possibly. If I ever was flying with drugs on me, I'd do a bit of valium to look calm as I walk into nothing to declare. But...better to have no drugs than wind up in a cell for the sake of a gram and two joints.
