    This is a clearnet link to the post office's website giving you an example of how all addresses should look.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/addressing/deliveryaddress.htm
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I found this link and info on a vendors page, and thought it was interesting and to pass it along to those of you who may not know (like me)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -All Caps
    <br/>
    -No punctuation
    <br/>
    -One space only between city and state
    <br/>
    -Two spaces between state and zip
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Name or attention line:          JANE L MILLER
    <br/>
    Company:                              MILLER ASSOCIATES
    <br/>
    Delivery address:        1960 W CHELSEA AVE STE 2006
    <br/>
    City, state, ZIP Code:     ALLENTOWN PA 18104
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use the following guidelines:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always put the address and the postage on the same side of your mailpiece.
    <br/>
    On a letter, the address should be parallel to the longest side.
    <br/>
    All capital letters.
    <br/>
    No punctuation.
    <br/>
    At least 10-point type.
    <br/>
    One space between city and state.
    <br/>
    Two spaces between state and ZIP Code.
    <br/>
    Simple type fonts.
    <br/>
    Left justified.
    <br/>
    Black ink on white or light paper.
    <br/>
    No reverse type (white printing on a black background).
    <br/>
    If your address appears inside a window, make sure there is at least 1/8-inch clearance around the address. Sometimes parts of the address slip out of view behind the window and mail processing machines can’t read the address.
    <br/>
    If you are using address labels, make sure you don’t cut off any important information. Also make sure your labels are on straight. Mail processing machines have trouble reading crooked or slanted information.

    I never receive mail exactly like that.  My mail usually comes like this,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Barack Obama
    <br/>
    1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW
    <br/>
    Washington, DC 20500-0003
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm looking right at my bills and that is what they look like.  I also have some junk mail right here that looks like this,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BARACK OBAMA
    <br/>
    OR CURRENT RESIDENT
    <br/>
    1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVE NW
    <br/>
    WASHINGTON DC  20500-0003
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So everyone sending me bills is addressing all of their mail in an incorrect format?

    If you are in the USA I would suggest you use this link. It gives you that extra 4 digit code at the end of your zip to allow your mail to be sorted through less machines to reach its destination. Plus, you can copy and paste the address that they give you as that is the proper way to write it.

    You're example is wrong.  Two spaces between the state and zip code. ;)

    I'm with Jack on this one... Seems as if most of my mail has only what should be capitalized as such. I'd imagine either work, perhaps imagine what you'd think the format would look like on the letter. An automated bill or junk mail might be all capitals. A personal correspondence probably only with certain capitalizations... Just a thought.

    I'm looking right at mail from this week on my desk in front of me lol.  I do know that the machines can't read cursive.  I sent a postal worker that I know a holiday card that I addressed in cursive and he informed me that the machine could not read it and that they HATE mail like that because they have to do it manually and it is more work for them.  Capitol letters might be easier for the automated machines to read, idk.
