    Hey Mr.A,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The name of the thread escapes me atm, but there is a thread here that had results from actual trials done with drug dogs, as to what works and what wont.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my personal opinion, w.e it is you will have (mdma,weed, w.e), if you vac seal it once or twice, wash your hands and the vac seal it self with rubbing alcohol and/or soap and water, rinse repeat, then seal it in some MBB, i would be more than confident that I could walk right over to a drug dog and tell him to fuck off, lmfao.. that is given of coarse you have no other residual odors of weed or other drugs any where on your person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As always bro, Much love.

    Sweet man, thanks! I think I've read that thread to be honest!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Those fucking dogs hate me for some reason, always sniffing at me even when I am without the ol' narcotics.. Granted that's probably because I am a walking chemical at this point! Haha.

    Let me know when the Molly gets to you btw man  :)

    Certainly will do bro, It did not show today, but according to our previous transactions i would expect it to arrive tomorrow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the dogs, i fucking feel you dude, when ever i would go see my people upstate or on rikers, the fucking drug hounds would always make two or three passes by me and linger unusually long..as you said, its prob because my body has begun to evolve into naturally producing mind altering substances and molecules all on its own , LMAO.

    I think most festivals do not do drug dogs because of the increased dangers of overdose. Honesty, how many festival goers are willing to just throw away their stash at the sight of a dog? Most people will panic and consume their nights worth of drugs in one shot than to throw it away. Usually festivals with police dogs have increased amount of people heading to the paramedic tents. Which is why police dogs are usually not present at festivals. Just heavy police presence and undercovers to try and weed out some dealers is usually the way they handle it.
