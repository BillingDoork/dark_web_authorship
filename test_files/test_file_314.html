    ok so I ordered 7g of marijuana last Monday (Oct 15).
    <br/>
    I won't name the seller because he is highly trusted and I'm sure this situation was not his fault.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but after the order failed to arrive for over a week, I contacted him again to ask if he could check on his end.
    <br/>
    according to him, the DCN says that the package was delivered on Saturday (Oct 20).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but I never got it. I don't have it.
    <br/>
    the mail came Saturday and it was the usual junk. I have no way to prove to him that I didn't receive it, but I didn't. I wouldn't be going through all this trouble just to scam him out of a single order. the only reason I bring this up is that I need to ask: has anything like this ever happened to anyone else before?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    according to the DCN tracking, the USPS delivered the order.
    <br/>
    but I don't have it. it was not in the mail. I've used Silk Road a few times now, and this is the first time this has happened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    could the seller have messed up my address?
    <br/>
    could the package have been intercepted but listed as delivered while legal actions are pending? are  the cops gonna' show up soon and start questioning me about it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can't just go to the post office and ask where it is... can I?
    <br/>
    I'm really freaking out over here.

    I once sent an item that I sold on ebay I had tracked the package and thought it was delivered. I was contacted by the buyer a couple days later and told the item never arrived.....I checked the confirmation and thought oh well the buyer said he would swear an affidavit if i needed him to. I contacted the post office as the item was insured and they told me flat out that "we said it was delivered so you cannot claim it wasn't... I was WTF I was trying to make a deal with the buyer to protect my feedback as at this time we are both thinking the other is trying some sort of scam when his postman comes up the driveway with his package as it was delivered to another address but the receiver stated it wasn't for them.  the lesson the post office taught me was the only way they would cover any lose if the receiver had to sign... I know that doesn't work in this community but my point is the post office does screw up you don't always need to wear tinfoil after packages go missing. If the address has been checked which I don't think the sender can do ( I think they only confirm the zip code but I could be wrong
    <br/>
    These are just my opinions and are only based on my experience not my intelligence

    I am not in the US so may not be best placed to comment on your domestic shipping situation but from what I've read on here USPS is a shambles most of the time and a confirmed delivery doesn't count for much apart from probably fucking up your chances of getting compensated by the vendor. If it doesn't show the best you can do is talk to the vendor and see if they are open to a reship/refund or whatever, I would say that it is highly unlikely the feds will come knocking for a 1/4 oz of green, at worse a letter IF (and that's a big if) it has been intercepted. Using a crystal ball would probably be more reliable that USPS tracking as many people have stated it rarely reflects the true status of your shipment, take from that what you will and I hope it turns up.

    aside from stories about when it happened to you, does anyone have any suggestions about what I might do next?
    <br/>
    or ideas about what could have happened besides the mailman getting high?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    because this is an experienced and trusted seller.
    <br/>
    I'm sure his packaging wasn't leaking strong odors or anything that would make the mailman tear it open and steal it.

    haha yes yes.... a little "dont fuck with me and i wont fuck with you" type thing....haha....actually i think it might have been a fuckup where she put it in the wrong box and the fuckin tweakers next door probably had a party.. I've been racking my brain ALL day...and i KNOW that it was no fuckup on my part.  But to further take care of the problem, my mail goes in a LOCKED dropbox from now on....already paved into the ground outside, and on the back of the building.  Out of sight, out of mind hopefully!  Had the day off and had a project.  They better have a jackhammer if they want my mail now.  It's just a real bummer because the guy sent me a lot...for nothing...and he has before.. hes a GREAT guy..much like you Mtljohn :) .. if this happened while dealing with you...id feel like the biggest ass-hat on the planet, too...much like i do right now.  In like a day and a half, ill be soon smoking that Jamaican Oil and Jean Guy...so I wanted to make sure everything is on point with the mail from here on out.  I will "just happen to be outside" when the mail lady shows up and watch her drop it in...keep an eye on any funny shit.  And with the cameras set up, ill be able to see if anyones fucking with the regular box too!..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If there's a theif...it will be rectified..instantly :) ...Happy things are back on point for me...but disappointed with the missing package... Stretch of bad luck straight up killin me holmes.... breakin my balls wicked hard :(

    at a retail counter in a Post Office.
    <br/>
    •What can I do if my Delivery Confirmation mailpiece hasn't been delivered?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The estimated delivery time for First-Class Mail® is two to three Postal business days. Since First-Class Mail does not have a tracking system, it does not provide the benefit of a guarantee like our Express Mail® service offers. Delivery Confirmation only provides you with a Confirmation of the delivery date and time once the article has been delivered to the addressee's Post Office; it does not provide for any tracking through the mail stream.  Without a tracking system affixed to First-Class Mail, we are not able to tell you where the item is within the mail stream or when it will be delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the DCN is only validated  "delivered to the addressee's Post Office"we are not able to tell you where the item is within the mail stream or when it will be delivered.

    haha well i wasnt just throwing out a story because it was story time...i was looking for opinions too.  But, honestly, if it was scanned as delivered.  That means the mailman, that actually walks the beat...like they do here, scanned it as delivered when they got out of the truck.  they get enough mail for like 10 houses before they go back to the truck.  Same routine, every day.. I watch the mail lady i have.  She parks right in front of my building.  She goes to the back of the truck and scans all the packages that have DCN, saying shes dropped them off (even though she hasn't actually got to my house yet) ..then she puts all the mail in the boxes, starting 3 houses up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Meaning, basically the only explanation for this is that they put it in the wrong box somehow.  OR it was stolen/taken .  If you told ANYONE about Silk Road, or expecting a package..id look there first man..thruthfully.  The chances the mailman fucked up are smaller than someone taking the drugs out of your mailbox that they knew were going to be there...idk your situation though.  I personally dont tell ANYONE about SR...no need  to ;) , so anyone stealing my mail would be random as shit....ahhh its a stressful situation isn't it man?

    Here in Canada,  I know a woman who used to work for the post office and she's told me about a few times when she's had packages that she claims she *knew* had weed in them because you could smell it.  She told me right to my face that she kept them!!!!  :o    Her logic was that no one mailing dope is going to be making all kinds of calls looking for their package if it goes missing.  Seems at least those two times she told me about, that was the case because she got away with it.  This was quite a few years ago though, in the early 90's,  long before this place, or the internet existed.   I don't know if it's the same now, but Canada Post always had a reputation for being full of dope smokers. Point is, don't assume the mail lady/man won't take it if they know theres dope in it. Of course with proper packaging they shouldn't know, so that shouldn't be a problem.  I don't know about now, but there was no urine testing then either.  Canada is no where near as urinalysis crazy as the US, so I doubt there is now either.  Not for mail deliverers anyway as it's not like they're handling dangerous equipment.

    They drive government vehicles though.  No way they aren't drug screened.  Maybe not all that often, but for sure.  They have one of the most important jobs in the country.  They can't just trust the nations mail to burnouts and druggies, or anyone else who would be tempted to take a package.  That bitch must've been pretty stupid to steal mail.  Federal offense here in the States.  Even if there was weed in it.  If the person ever figures out the mailman has been stealing mail, its the mailman's word against his where the weed came from...the mailman could have put it there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Needless to say, one who steals mail is way more retarded than one who gets a gram of pot in the mail.  I'd rather get busted with a little pot i just got in my mailbox, than busted stealing my neighbors Dunkin' Donuts coupons.... I'll take a misdemeanor over a felony anyday! ;)

     ok so I ordered 7g of marijuana last Monday (Oct 15).
     <br/>
     I won't name the seller because he is highly trusted and I'm sure this situation was not his fault.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     but after the order failed to arrive for over a week, I contacted him again to ask if he could check on his end.
     <br/>
     according to him, the DCN says that the package was delivered on Saturday (Oct 20).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     but I never got it. I don't have it.
     <br/>
     the mail came Saturday and it was the usual junk. I have no way to prove to him that I didn't receive it, but I didn't. I wouldn't be going through all this trouble just to scam him out of a single order. the only reason I bring this up is that I need to ask: has anything like this ever happened to anyone else before?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     according to the DCN tracking, the USPS delivered the order.
     <br/>
     but I don't have it. it was not in the mail. I've used Silk Road a few times now, and this is the first time this has happened.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     could the seller have messed up my address?
     <br/>
     could the package have been intercepted but listed as delivered while legal actions are pending? are  the cops gonna' show up soon and start questioning me about it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can't just go to the post office and ask where it is... can I?
     <br/>
     I'm really freaking out over here.

    this very thing happened to one of my customers this week. I believe him when he says it didn't arrive as he finalized, etc., but I am as perplexed about it as he is. Is it possible it was stolen from your mail box?

    well technically that's possible, sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but according to the DCN it was delivered on Saturday and we were home on Saturday.
    <br/>
    I remember taking the mail from the mailman personally because we were outside at the time. he handed it to me and I brought it in. no one had time to steal it.

    Here they have workers who drive Can Post vans and they drop stuff off in big post boxes for the mailperson to p/u, then there's the ones that strictly walk their routes. I was thinking that the walkers probably aren't urine tested, but I don't know for sure as I haven't talked to that woman for years.  Thinking about it, I remember now that she said the package was from Jamaica and there wasn't a few grams in it, but a QP.   So the charge would have been a bit heavier.  Again, this was 25 yrs ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In Canada tampering with the post is a federal offense too.  I don't doubt that there are still postal workers who steal mail now and again.  Up here, there is a guy who has a mail order mj biz set up.  On clearnet, not through TOR or anything like that.  :o Just out in the open, for years now, with no heat at all.  Finally, after some years, he password protected the site, but that's it.  I just checked now though, and the site isn't pw protected anymore.  Just out in the open again.  ??? Cripes, you can google the biz name and it's right there, 2nd hit on the list.  Seems the powers that be, aren't too worried about him. I believe he only sends to Canada though.  His hash is steep at $40 a gram, but it's made from primo weed, so it's strong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, I'm digressing.  My point is, a lot of people were sending him cash in the mail.  He posted on the site that after some months, a lot of money started simply disappearing.  His thought was that some scammer in the PO figured out that a lot of money was being sent to his address, and just started stealing it.  Who knows if that was the case, or not, but it sure seems feasible as there wasn't really any other plausible explanation.  I'm just saying, I don't doubt at all that there are postal employees that steal.  If it's true that the USPS is really cash strapped and there are few postal inspectors, then that's even less for those that are dishonest to worry about.  May be a federal offence, but so is sending drugs through the mail.  That doesn't stop people.

    I did not get my mail today as I expected.  I am domestic and always get 2nd day delivery and this would have been day 3. So it'll be day 4 at the soonest.  This is a highly rated trustworthy vendor, and it'll probably come tomorrow, but I'm a bit nervous in the meantime anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another minor thing I noticed this time is that he shipped the mail late at night.  I'm familiar with this vendor's counter-intel and if he used the same legend this time, well it doesn't quite fit with the time of day.  I hope I'm overanalysing everything but I'm nervous again, and once again the voice is going through my head saying scary things to me...

    <br/>
    On an amusing side note, this is my third time trying to post this. The first time I somehow hit enter on the post button, posting half the message, the second time I thought I was in vim and hit ctrl-w to erase a word, thereby closing my browser window instead.  Any day my bud wants to arrive, it can...
