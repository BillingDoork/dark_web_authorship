    So heres the deal, I purchased some pills here on SR and had it sent to a mail forwarding company in a first class country that ships internationally( dont ask why, too much information). Now, I made a fake email account using my own itouch in the clearnet and message the mail forwarding company that theres a
    <br/>
    mail arriving to their office for me to be shipped internationally to my country. Now my real concern is what would the LE do if they intercepted my package before the mailing company was able to ship it to my country? Can they amd will they trace the ip address back to me since I made and use the email in the clearnet to contact the mailing company? And if so, would they waste their time finding me in my country even though its just 50 pills? Im really paranoid right so any advice? I know it was a stupid thing to make that email but its the only way I can contact the mailing company.  Thanks

    The forwarding company will cooperate.  You really think that they will tell the police to piss off or something?  They will be obligated to tell them where they were forwarding that parcel to.

    My real concern is can they trace the ip back to my itouch? And not really worried about where the package is going to because all the packaged is shipped to their office in my country where I can pick it up or just ignore it. Just really worried about my ip since I used to to create an email add in the clearnet which I used to message them.

    Also the mac address of your itouch is in their router now.  Also in your router.  Also in your itouch of course lol.  Not much you can do.  I wouldn't sweat it.  Is it a small amount of pills?  Prescription hopefully?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should be more worried about the forwarding company telling LE where the package was being forwarded to.

    Wait - why do you think this package is going to be intercepted? Or are you paranoid about "just in case"? Maybe buy a legitimate package using the forwarding company?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to take precaution, clean house (including the ipod) so in case they perform a CD there's nothing incriminating at your property. Try to worry less.

    Lol 50 pills calm the fuck down. If any LE or customs officer finds those they will most likely just through them in the trash and MAYBE write you a love letter.

    You're leaving too much detail out to be able to say anything for sure. To begin with you're not mentioning if you used your own ID, a fake one or none at all when registering with the Mail Forwarder itself, this obviously sets the stage for how it proceeds. Now I have to assume since you don't mention any details you didn't use any ID and are thus only able to use UPS/FedEx/DHL which all require signature to get your packages, these companies regularly get a lot of drugs sent through them and they will let alert Law Enforcement to any package instantly if they find it. If you had used an ID of some kind for the Mail Forwarder you could easily have been able to avoid having your address in the system as you wouldn't have to specify your address right away then. Another huge aspect in this is what kind of stealth the Vendor you bought from provides, if it's just 50 pills in a bottle which can easily be heard by shaking the package then that's obviously going to create a lot of suspicion.

    If you ordered to your own name and address the point of what connection you used becomes moot, multiple Mail Forwarders let you store mail with them before they forward them but since you didn't pick this option you won't have any options on this matter. If you intend to do this in a similar way in the future I would suggest you use a VPN, perhaps one from the thread VPN Services That Take Your Anonymity Seriously, 2013 Edition: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=177551

    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're going to use Mail Forwarders in what appears to be the most superficial way possible (ie. no ID required at first Mail Forwarder) you should at the very least send the Package to a secondary Mail Forwarder in your own country before you ship it to yourself, in that way you will at the very least know if it made it through Customs or not. Still I can't entirely blame you for thinking it would be this easy as technically it is, as long as nothing gets caught. :P

    Well I'm leaving out details because I'm that paranoid. Well anyway, I used real name but didnt have to give my address since they dont send the package to you. You just go to their office branch in my country and claim it, that way not too much information is given.
