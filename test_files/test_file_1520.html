    Sometime, last week I placed an order, with express shipping. Nothing huge or anything, or really that detectable, all domestic. Its 4-5 days later, and the package has yet to come in. Is this normal? I haven't really started to worry, just would like to know if anyone else has had a problem like this before. I tried messaging the vendor, but the thing is he has not been seen in a couple days as well. Can any one relate?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks,

    I would check to see the actually status of your order. If it says 'processing' instead of 'shipped' that means the vendor could still be getting the shipment ready for you. A lot goes into the logistics, from book keeping to stealth. I would check his feedback on SR and word on the forums for his reputation. That's something to do before ordering though. Other than that I would sit and watch the order status, and resolve a problem if the shipment still doesn't come in a day before the order autofinalizes.

    Your vendor has shit the bed and failed to mail your stuff.   Be sure to leave a 1 of 5 if you do receive the product.  I'm tired of vendors getting good reviews when you pay $40 for next day shipping and they can't get it to you for 4-5 days!

    Now now... you should at least contact the vendor to see what they say first.  If it was express, they should have tracking should they not?

    WE had an express mail that was said to be shipped on the 2nd, actually went into the system on the 3rd after the cut off..4th was a holiday..marked by usps as to be delivered on the 6th..well it just disappeared and then arrived on the 9th! soaking wet..with no tracking past the 3rd when it went in...so odd things do happen..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But ..in my experience if the vendor isnt responding or isnt on..they didnt send it..that has happened too..then suddenly they answer to keep you from canceling the order, and then sit on it another few days and overnight becomes a week or more..

    Express packages within the same country are automatically considered suspicious. I would never buy drugs with express. Been saying this for years and still do not get why people have not caught on. EXPRESS MAIL IS TREATED AS SUSPICIOUS MAIL. Every south eastern us dealer who has been busted has been because of express mail or 3rd party carriers! What do the idiots do? hire a bum to pick up the package in case they get caught, instead of just NOT SHIPPING EXPRESS and having no risks.  Sorry this doesnt answer your question but people need to know they are setting themselves up by paying express postage.

    Really?I see a lot of people ordering express without any problems everyday.Maybe i do not hear of the problems because people got busted but one would think there is a ton of express mail shipped every day!I remember reading that express is treated very carefully by the usps as they get in shit if anything happens but never heard that they are just thinking something must be wrong if it is an express pack just for the sake of it being an express pack if it's domestic.If this is true then a LOT of people are gonna be getting busted real soon.So express international is ok or same thing?I am in Canada.Thanks for the tip.

    I better tell my family to stop sending things Express Mail! Could screw up my whole drug buying experience! ::)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many of them think nothing of using Express Mail. (usually their company's corporate acct)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also the investment co I use always sends stuff Express.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess I'm on some sorta 'watch list' ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check the vendors FB and see if you're not alone. I use it occasionally, but it usually is not worth it. Many vendors are not that dedicated to rush out an Express Mail order. Some are great about it, and even give a cut-off time, like "in order for Express, must have order in by 1pm EDT" or something.

    I recently had a parcel i ordered reg mail and the vendor sent it with tracking and did it without asking me (Not happy about this). So i check the tracking number and it go to my country... then a day later it says failed delivery a few times then it says delivered that day. The parcel has obviously been intercepted it was a small quantity what are the chances of my address being flagged?

    I'd like to see some reference material for this, because I just don't buy it. Every package I've got off the road has been express. I could maybe understand for pot, but other things (heroin in my case) you can easily make it nice and flat like it's just an important document or something. I don't see how express is more unsafe. If anything they have to gurantee it so it seems like they would spend even less time checking it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the OP, I've had good luck with express. 18 Times express, 14 have been overnight at my address since it is in a city, not out in the country. I tried an address 1 time in the country, which made it automatically take 2 days. I had another 2 that took till the second day, but I am almost completely certain it was because the vendor took an extra day to ship, but marked it in transit early(DieselTherapy, known for doing this). The remaining 1 time (and longest time I had to wait for a package,) it took 3 days to make it here, which is outside of the 2 guarantee, however, this happened over 4th of July, so USPS of course always has problems on holidays.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was gunna say packages can very rarely get lost in the mail, or seized - but after seeing that you said your vendor hasn't been online in a few days, it makes it pretty obvious that something has happened to him. Either personal problems, busted, or ran out of product. Just message him and hopefully he'll get back on soon. If he sent it, it would have definitely arrived by now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck, I know it sucks waiting.

    i will literally never understand that statement, its made by so many people.  just domestic well over 25 million packages ship every day, whose putting up flags on envelopes.  Look at at the vendor in stimulant Kush, his prices are twice that of others, yet he is 3rd overall in order because he only ships express everyday.  to say its treated as suspicious i dont even understand, treated by who?? most express packages only touch two hands from begininng to end, the guy at the post office who grabs it, then the person who delivers it, everything else it electronic for the most part.  Same as worldhub in Louisville or Memphis.  I have heard people actually say that you need a search warrant for priority mail and first class, ect, but express, you dont.  He must have made that up.  Nowhere on usps.com will anyone find anything that is even close to that.  If anyone does post it and i will apologize over and over.  Im not a vendor but the people who say that do not understand mailing industry im positive.  Ill even challenge someone who is a vendor, who thinks this is anywhere accurate, to show me you have more the 200 sales total.  I doubt there will be.  so they just dont know bc they havent mailed much.  I am starting to hate that statement and i really dont care at all if not one ships express,  but a smart vendor would do this:
    <br/>
    1) read as much as possible on usps.com first
    <br/>
    2) then at least OFFER the option, jack the price up to whatever you want, keep other shipping method the same
    <br/>
    3) then after a year or so you'll see that even common sense would say several million express packages are sent a day, if there was some magical person that cared to be suspicious he better hurry up and why is he gonna target an envelope.  then still you have to go through the same warrant crap as priority whatever so this person that doesnt exist has 30 seconds to convince someone that this is a flag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kush never says anything, and he makes bank on every order, with high prices, he gets to many orders to even handle, all because he only ships express.  I dont take any credit away from him, i think its smart, let everyone else think these crazy things while he is in the shadows making a killed with higher prices than everyone else.  everyone knows you can just find an express box instead of a blue collection box, there are much fewer but there still all over, and drop them in there, so now your just as safe as your priority shipping except you made money on the order then an extra 30$ on just shipping.  and if ur sending 4-5 orders a day its a lot, for not much more effort.  please everyone, show me a quote from usps.com (not a forum or anywhere else) that says anything close to all the wrong info that goes around, or please stop making that statement.  Its made way too often when its not only wrong, its just crazy weird thinking.  that ill never understand.  ship however u want but that statement has to end or be quoted from usps.com (which it wont)

    I think everyone is nervous of getting caught. LOL. Even more so lately with a few of the CD's that are being posted. I know that I have a package coming in that requires signature and I'm kind of nervous to sign for it. But even in a CD they don't have enough to convict someone. Just keep your house clean and water the lawn, maybe plant some flowers. Idk, just making myself feel better.

    The whole paranoia over signatures is simply stupid - it is simply not a risk to sign for a package as it cannot be shown to increase your knowledge of the contents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Appearances are huge, you are correct there.  Keeping a clean house and an up-kept yard are minimal social standards that help you blend in and look normal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For mail, appearance is equally as important.  If your package is ghetto wrapped with an illegible return address, then ya, express is going to be a bit more suspicious then letter mail.  But if it looks like a standard express package or envelope, it is ridiculous to suggest that the package will be subject to scrutiny over an express stamp.

      I think everyone is nervous of getting caught. LOL. Even more so lately with a few of the CD's that are being posted. I know that I have a package coming in that requires signature and I'm kind of nervous to sign for it. But even in a CD they don't have enough to convict someone. Just keep your house clean and water the lawn, maybe plant some flowers. Idk, just making myself feel better.

     The whole paranoia over signatures is simply stupid - it is simply not a risk to sign for a package as it cannot be shown to increase your knowledge of the contents.

     Appearances are huge, you are correct there.  Keeping a clean house and an up-kept yard are minimal social standards that help you blend in and look normal.

     For mail, appearance is equally as important.  If your package is ghetto wrapped with an illegible return address, then ya, express is going to be a bit more suspicious then letter mail.  But if it looks like a standard express package or envelope, it is ridiculous to suggest that the package will be subject to scrutiny over an express stamp.
