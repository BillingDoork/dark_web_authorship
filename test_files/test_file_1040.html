    I imagine it would be quite a lot. Order 4 gram of mushrooms once. That was a relatively small and inconspicuous package. If that were ketamine instead of shrooms. Damn. I can't even imagine how much money that would be worth.

    The most coke iv ever had at one time sent to me was 4 grams, and that was only cause i won it from vendor 'DELTA11' LAST year or 1st this year, along with a fukin half OZ of fucking Bad ass bud, which i dont do neither really, but excepted it cause i won and wanted it to make money. but i have never order'd over 1 gram of H to my house,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    iV HAD 30 AND 60 PILLS shipped but thats as high as it goes for me..  Luckly Iv always always been one of those guys who order's stuff off the net, Shoes,shirts, games, jewlery all kinda shit, and iv been doing it like 6 years, so for packages from all over to show is nothing new to my P O.. PLus i knw my postal carriers sis really well.. really really well..lol

    I would feel comfortable Hoestly with a Ounce Of H sent to me, also depending on the vendor as well..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it were jjust some vendor i know doesnt prictice good stealth in high volume order's that would have to play a big role in how much weight i would have sent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When i introduced a personal friend of mine to SR we saw $ signs cause there was a few things in the opiate section that are just not around here AT ALL..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now my buddy on the other hand has 4 rental houses and together we threw in and had 1 brick in stamps sent to a rental ppl had just moved out of as well in the next week, as 2 ounces of H and half ounce coke..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now i would never order this amount to my own place i reside but the drop spot i spoke of is a great plan, and he has actually turned Renter's down and put them on hold ATM, and just parks a few cars in the yard and we will go sit and have a beer,play some games whatever to make it look like someone lives there
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To bad he's moving in 3 mnths, so im getting all my funds together i can to do a massive re up for myself as well as to continue selling where he was the 1st man to call and id be 2nd, but he's even offerd to wok out a awesome deal of not renting the place out and continue it being the sorta front it is, as well as continue throwing in the $ to get decent size amounts long as he's getting paid so thats really a thought for me and a big decesion to take all that on at one time, only he and I know where were bringing it from, ppl ask all the time how in the fuck were getting H and such high quality yay,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most time reply is 'DID U COME TO BUY DOPE OR INTER AGATE? WTF DOES IT MATTER ITS HERE" LOL.. ppl will actually pay 25 to 35 all day long for stamps the size of deezle, but he never puts out that damn light.. LOL..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again though to my own house for person items as i said before in my 1st post.

    K+Molly, I don't want. - That's personal preference.

    <br/>
    I try to stick to PUA's (Personal Usage Amts) - Though I've gotten as much as 10 grams amphetamine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once I got 5 orders in one day! I had ordered on different days leading up to this. One was super fast, one was almost a month late, (100 Valium), I got 2 5 gram orders of speed, 2 grams of heroin and an 8ball of Coke. - I don't always live that large. I had just gotten my tax return.  ;)
