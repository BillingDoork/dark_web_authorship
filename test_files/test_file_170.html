    Im new to this forum and im already paranoid. I wanna order really badly but i live with parents so say i ordered a couple grams of bud in the mail and the seller did an amazing job vacum sealing and everything is there still a big chance it gets seized? Also say it was seized by customs (im in the US) would they come to my door and arrest me or would they just throw it out? I really cant risk having them come to my door i dont want anyone getting arrested i would rather them just throw it out and never contact me in any way.
    <br/>
    What are the chances if i buy off another person in the USA or in Canada?
    <br/>
    Also would you recommend buying xanax or some other pills instead of some bud?
    <br/>
    Whiich is easier to get past customs?
    <br/>
    Im really nervous about it after reading stories on here.

    Most users share your concerns and there's countless vendor review threads in the "rumor mill" section. Once you've found an established vendor (over 300 transactions) check their feedback at the bottom and then come to the forums and read their review threads. After you got a few good transaction you'll feel a lot better.

    Are you kidding me? you are in the us, you have virtually very little change of you getting cut, and if you ordered to pro US vendors I even say you have no chance. Relax and order locally to pros. Unless your mother check your mail George Constanza style.... Or you do stupid stuff like name not matching address or letters misplaced in the name, that is red flag. You can use fake name but this name has to match the address, you have to figure out how to do this if you are going fake.

    The best advice I can give you is do not order anything more until you have read as much on these forums as possible including everything about security, PGP,Â  encryption, bitcoin, vendor reviews, how to set up a safe drop etc etc etc Once you have educated yourself you will feel less paranoid and anxious because you will know the risks and how to reduce them. Until then keep reading.

    There's a thread on this forum that aggregates delivery success statistics. Overall, 96.5% of packages arrive safely, but that number doesn't tell the whole story. A package is much more likely to get seized in customs, sot he delivery success rate there may be 93-95% while delivery success for domestic shipping is higher than 99%. For small amounts, they won't do a controlled delivery. They'll send you a letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So your best bet is to order small and domestic.
