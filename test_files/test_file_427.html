    So my friend and i are going to buy some weed, hash, and other items. The plan was to ship it to my house, however i do not normally get mail shipped to my house. I use a post office box to receive my everyday mail. When i put down the address for the vendors to send their product to, should i put down my physical address (my house), or my mailing address (P.O. Box)

    Mail it to your PO box, if that is where you get all your reg mail. Maybe youll want to have the cannabis sent to your home, unless your sure the vendor your buying from has very smell proof and stealth packaging.

    would i need to sign for the cannibis delivered to my home? it would have to be delivered UPS or Fedex style, because the post office does not recognize my home address as a mailable address correct?

    USPS sends mail to residences all the time, and tbh I can't think of a single situation where USPS wouldn't be able to deliver to an address that UPS or Fedex somehow could.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'd be taking a lot more risk using UPS/Fedex instead of USPS if you go that route, because the former two are private entities and literally have the right to open any package they want for any reason. USPS is owned by the government and is therefore held to laws about the gov needing a warrant to open and inspect your stuff. In other words, USPS = warrant needed. UPS/Fedex = teen employee opens your package and steals your stuff on a whim because he likes drugs and doesn't really care about his job. (Exaggeration, but really, their employees can inspect anything just because they feel like it, and even non-drug items are often stolen)

    Vendors use the mail not couriers, so use the same address that you use for getting all of your mail.Â  Are you sure you are ready to purchase as this is a basic question

    I am sure that i wish to purchase these items. The first time my friend and i purchased something from here, we used his home address, where he usually gets mail sent to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically, what you all are saying is if i get it sent to my house, the packages will be sent via UPS or FedEx. If i get it sent to my P.O. Box, then there should be no problem?

    No, I'm trying to say that there's no reason you shouldn't be able to have USPS deliver to your home address. You don't have to use your PO Box to receive mail via USPS. You should use USPS, but using them doesn't limit you to one address or the other; you can use USPS for either.
    <br/>
    However if you do normally only receive mail at your PO Box, the package will likely go unnoticed there. But if you live with relatives at home with the same last name (and presumably you're using your real last name), it wouldn't really raise eyebrows for your package to arrive there, either. Not everyone gets mail all the time.
    <br/>
    I don't think it's a super important point, but you might want to think about the size of your PO Box vs the potential size of the package, and whether you feel more comfortable with the package being dropped at your doorstep with no confirmation from you VS if your PO Box is too small you'll have to go to the counter to claim and receive the package.

    I just ordered and chose to have it sent to my house. Got a priority box package the other week and would have probably been too big for my mailbox. Thank you everyone for the help. Happy Holidays.
