    What iv gathered from reading over the months is that Fedex&amp;UPS dont have near the number of packages that USPS has, meaning USPS employes have more mail to sort, so they are less likely to inspect every package... Also USPS is under-funded compared to Fedex/UPS....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This may not be the main reason no one uses them but thats the basics from what iv gathered...

    You can use them but I would only use them if you know the person you're sending/receiving to or from. If it's off SR then hopefully it's USPS.

    FedEx, UPS and other private companies can and do check all packages - they can even open them if they want. USPS requires a WARRANT before they can do that.   ;D

    i find both private couriers to be very useful depeding on what you are sending and where.   for international express USP is light years ahead of USPS.  in all areas.   for domestic i would stick with usps, but if you need to guarantee arrival, always go with fedex.  usps can't guarantee a fucking thing, ever.

    In my spirit, I feel safest receiving packages from USPS because I have a close relative that works there and I have a pretty solid idea of how they operate and what stress they are under.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have another close relative that works for UPS. They are on such a tight time schedule that unless it is just totally worth it off of a hunch, they don't have time to inspect packages either, but they deal with much less volume. However, I have never used them sending or receiving.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I have used FedEx for shipping to customers. And I only used it to ship to customers that I knew and had built a relationship personally. I get the most nervous using them because I always use the C.O.D. option and they pretend like they will lose so much money if it doesn't make it, but thankfully, I never lost a package.
