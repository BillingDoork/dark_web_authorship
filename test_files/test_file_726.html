    So a friend sent me an ounce of MDMA, mostly unrelated to SR other than the fact the molly originated from here (SuperTrips finest). Anyway, its maybe a day or two late showing up from when I would have expected it, and today I get one of those "Sorry We Missed You" cards saying I have an express mail package, with "large envelope, magazine, etc" circled. However, my friend says he shipped priority (note: no priority option to check on card) and in a small priority flat rate box, not envelope. But I'm not expecting anything else? Also, it says no signature required, so I don't know what to do. Do I go try and pick up whatever this is? Maybe it has nothing to do with the drugs I'm waiting for. Maybe it is the drugs, but its not a controlled delivery. Or maybe.... shit I don't know. What do you guys think? Should I sign it and say "leave by door" or something like that? Why wouldn't they try to deliver at my house if they wanted to bust me? I'm nervous...

    I think you should go and pick it up and deny everything if all goes to shit, you cannot control what you get in the post regardless, just say you got the note to call so you called, play ignorant to the situation,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before you go and collect it though clean out your house of all your gear, hide your laptop, mobile phone, drug paraphernalia etc somewhere off the premises just incase they do do a follow up search after, just deny and keep denying, if its your first offence they will just think your guy just got his address wrong or someone else is trying to set your address up for a collection themselves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck either way man thats alot of gear to be hanging around, im waiting on 1g of coke to Ireland from ST for 15 days and im stressing like crazy. i cant imagine how shite losing a full oz of gorgeous MD would be, hope everything works out for ya man, ill send some good karma vibes your way i need some back for my 1gram to deliver though! Peace!

    Since it doesn't require a signature...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just check redelivery on the card and stick it back in your mailbox....

    Wait a couple days and theyll deliver it to wherever you specify on the card.

    Dude you're 100% fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS missed you and wants to redeliver or have you pick up the package at the post office. A controlled delivery takes weeks to plan out. Either schedule a redelivery online (which is what I've done in the past) or go pick it up at the address on the back of the slip.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll be good either way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: This happened to me before if you didn't get that already. I freaked out for no reason but did a little research and realized that no LE is ever gonna wait at the post office for you to pick up a package. Nor set up a CD within a couple of days. Think about it. Do what I told you and you'll be sitting on a zip of some bomb bomb candy

    Well, there must be a damn good reason for people to be jumping off this bridge, and after ascertaining what it was which had cause such suicidal panic, then yeah, I'd likely jump too.

    They do not leave a slip on your door for controlled deliveries in my experience. They usually watch the address and make sure someone is there before sending a UC to attempt delivery. Never sign for something that does not require a signature. That is a tell tale sign of a CD. :D
