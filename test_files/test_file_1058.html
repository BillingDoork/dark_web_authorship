    Hello All,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been a long time sponge on the forums and, as of tonight, have decided to let my voice be heard. I come to you all (who's opinion I genuinely respect more than nearly anyone on the subject) with a few simple questions. Feel free to chime in but please only seriously answer if you have experience in shipping larger quantities of pot. Thanks and hopefully this will start a good discussion. :-)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A few general questions to start the dialogue:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) In the last few years I have been on the receiving end of many, many, large shipments of pot. Most of these were sent CA to the Midwest and contained between 3-5 lbs. They were always vac sealed but used no other real stealth (no printed labels, no MBB, etc). Recently I have heard/experienced a very different reality. Will printed labels and MBB's do the trick even for packages of 3-5 lb?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) Pre-paid postage (printed labels) are a huge plus in terms of stealth, no doubt, but why are they so difficult to obtain anonymously? Only a few vendors have advertised openly that they are able to do so and of those only one or two are willing to sell their info. Even still, it is in my opinion fairly steep in price. Would anyone care to shed some light or make a suggestion?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3) I have heard recently that packages being delivered which have the signature waived are still being asked to be signed for (some have cited this as being called "part of a new policy") Is there anything to read further into here? I typically stick to the advice of never signing, but this throws a small curve ball.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again any help you might be willing or able to provide would be appreciated I'm sure not only by me but by all of the members of SR who engage in similar practices.Â  You need not worry I will spout off any advice you have for shipping herb, this is a very secret aspect of my life I prefer not to share with anyone. If you feel a small compensation may be worth your while to fill me in on printed labels, I would love to strike up a deal. Best of luck to all and stay safe.

    You need to research on your OWN for at least 6 months before you come back to SR and try and sell. With the two posts I have read, you have not tried hard at ALL to figure this information out. If you are not planning on vending here, then I will call you out as possible law enforcement fishing for info.

    Thanks Blueveil, for such a warm welcome to the SR. Luckily for you, I have no interest in selling pot on SR. Unluckily for, other more rational members of the road have been super super accommodating and let me in on the "big secret" lol. Hop off your high horse douche bag, just because you have 600 posts doesn't make you some LE which hunt rally man. If you were to see my purchase history you'd quickly id just another guy trying to support a habit. Perhaps maybe I just left pertinent information out for my own safety, or perhaps I was looking to PM with experienced shippers and avoid repeating myself 10 times on the forums. Either way, I don't really give a fuck what you think about anything I have to say. Have a great day!

    Hey dab,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to share some knowledge this side as well it'd be greatly appreciated. I want to be importing large quantities into Aus, but we all know what dicks Customs are here. And to my shock a lot of the vendors (for weed at least) have decided to just not ship at all or ask for an FE, do their shitty stealth that they do for domestic orders and leave the rest to the Woman above.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd love to get some info just so I can educate vendors who are piss scared to post to Aus cause they think the smell of pot still goes through 1 layer of vaccum seal (NO SHIT SHERLOCK)
