    im standin in the post office with a few letters to mail off - not weed of course - and it's way backed up with people. they have one person working and the rest are just standing around in the back visible to all of us in line - typical government run operation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so i start looking around at packaging that all the other 15 or so people have and i almost  start laughing out loud. boxes taped together with duct tape, boxes with electrical tape, random stamps all over them probably from all different years, horrible hand written labels, boxes and bubble mailers all different colors (one was an old toaster box), and so on. i think i only saw one package with USPS material.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now i get very anal and upset when i see a package i deem sloppy from a vendor but after this i'm thinkin maybe i'm overreacting LOL
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ***this trip was not a total waste tho as this old po had cameras that could not record a person if they stood back 18" from desk - large overhang- may come in handy some day

    I noticed this as well a few days ago after standing in line myself. I watched what looked like a mid 30s couple mailing a medium sized box..I watched for ten minutes as they applied tape all over this box..and I mean all over, I just stood there, staring at the worst shippinjob I have ever seen in my life

    they make it because not everyone is pro at shipping and some people just package really quick. i think it is fine in some cases but a vender should not do it at all!! you are messing with peoples lifes

    I feel like when a box is so stupidly done they just say, "that just can't be drugs, it looks like a retard packaged it."
    <br/>
    The fact is the majority of usps box's shipped look like a three year old packaged them.
    <br/>
    Maybe we shouldn't make our box's here in the road look professional. They stick out.

    Heh, you would have a point, except in front of a judge there is a list of conditions which if a package meets a certain number of them qualify it as being sufficient for probable cause to issue a search warrant.

    As funny as it sounds I'm sure most of the terribly packed illegal items in the mail still get through. Handwritten address, reused jiffy bags etc... are all regularly used when you sold something on eBay for a quick dollar. I once had an ounce of MDMA come from NL in a envelope which was made out of A4 paper lol.

    Back in the day, when weed came from canada, a qp would come in vanilla business envelopes, 1 vac seal, and hand written wording, when private forums where the only mail order marijuana sources;  Never had a issue.     I received a half ounce of mushrooms in a large envelope labeled clothes form england once too; horrible packaging.   with that said, i order from tons of companies on the web, and most of the time, the packaging is professional.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The conclusion that most packaged mail is poor, i think is unfounded.  Location of drop will be a much wider indicator.  It may look kinda weird seeing a bunch of packages from a unknown "Cartright Industries", in a mailbox in front of apartment housing.  I think vendors should use envelopes more, other than that, most do a great job.

    I have seen some pretty jenky shit being shipped at the Post Office myself. But I also see a lot of nicely prepared flat rate boxes and envelopes. If I'm not mistaken, when the Postal clerk tapes something up, it is official USPS tape with their logo on it, so they know that something was taped the shit out of by the clerk and not the customer. Remember, taping every seam of a package completely with the idea that someone is trying to seal in any odor of illegal substances is a USPS red flag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I have seen people use boxes that look like they are about to fall apart, envelopes stuffed with way too much, all kinds of shit. But I still feel that SR packages should look as professional as possible because if I remember right, person to person packages are red flags too rather than business to business, business to person or vice versa.

    Hell very possible it would have come through with "MDMA" written on the outside of the envelope.  I doubt customs even looks at envelopes.  I don't really know though.

    Its honestly crazy/ amazing when seeing packages being sent by the Non SRers. Ive almost busted of in laughter a couple of times. Funny because without the SR forums, majority of SR packages would probably look the exact same.

    This is hilarious. I recently received a bubble wrap package with xanax lol , I had received some from another vendor in a box before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess the only real concern with packaging I see would be for speed: non-hand-written zipcode+last4 ; for security : priority boxes with business labels at the very least would be somewhat satisfactory I would think to everyone on here. There is so much stuff being mailed everyday. I forget where I saw it but I heard that USPS deals with more mail in one day then fedex/ups does in a year.

    I don't have any basis to confirm this, but I think it is an excellent point.  All vendors should have some sort of sound fake business return address and appropriate packaging.  For example just consider how many eBay packages are going through the system and what they mostly look like.  That is a lot of volume to easily blend into.
