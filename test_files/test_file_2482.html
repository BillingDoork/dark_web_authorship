    GO PICK UP YOUR PACKAGES.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is a totally normal process. It is caused by your mail box not being big enough, lazy mailmen, international packages and on and on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It isnt a sting operation to catch you and your few grams of cocaine or you half lb of weed. Your not that big of a deal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If police want to do a controlled delivery, they will repeatedly try you at your home, they wont lure you into a public setting to try and make an arrest.

    Actually not.. it depends on country and many other mystical conditions..
    <br/>
    In some places that would be unimaginable.. Supposedly where you are..
    <br/>
    In other parts of the world that is perfectly normal for the police to pack ppl at the p.o.
    <br/>
    Why fucking not? That's easier than going after real life dealers and bonuses are the same..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm saying so based on my real personal experience.. A negative one..
    <br/>
    First order and a bummer, i'm currently facing felony charges.. Breaking the will they locked me up
    <br/>
    in a state mental institution where i spent 28 days with real crazy people: schizophrenics and murderers..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So best advice would be: Think for yourself and use your intuition..

    Why they want you at home is because "anyone" can claim to be the designated person, know a birthday, or house address. Take that into consideration.
