    Other places sell stamps than the PO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Can you throw those in a bag I don't want to lose em."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tadaaaa now you only touch the bag. And I still wipe the stamps with lysol wipes to destroy and oil patterns left by anyones finger prints.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and as far as dropping it in a blue box. You drive to a city 30 minutes away from where you live with a bike in the back. Slap on your helmet, slip on your backpack full of envelopes slap on your biking gloves. YOU ARE NOW A NORMAL LOOKING BIKER
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pull up to the box, grab your mail drop it into the box and take off.

     You would have to dip your whole hand in it if you've ever been arrested.  They take your palm prints, the side of your hand, the sides of your fingers and everywhere they can.

    first off...
    <br/>
    anyone using latex is just retarded, sorry.
    <br/>
    latex still allows fingerprints through a glove or two or three.
    <br/>
    vinyl gloves, no powder. 2-3 glovers per layer of packaging...
    <br/>
    then go to the P.O.. ask for stamps, throw the STAMPS and RECEIPT in a bag... success.
    <br/>
    leave with your bag..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and hell, even if you're in a town where NO ONE ever drives by or listens or looks...
    <br/>
    you can use a glove or two to throw a box in a drop box... it's not suspicious at all...
    <br/>
    MOSTLY ALL POSTAL WORKERS WEAR GLOVES... herp derp.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks.

    I've never seen that in my entire life.  I've never seen people wear gloves in the summer.  Is I saw someone wearing gloves and putting packages in a blue box I would bet a lot of money that there is something illegal in one of those packages.

    not saying run around in leather gloves..
    <br/>
    BUT.. if you wanted to you could wear gym shorts and an underarmour shirt...
    <br/>
    and some football/baseball gloves.. boom, looks like you just left practice or are going to practice..
    <br/>
    and dropping something off for your parents or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and.. i live around towns of 600-1200 people...
    <br/>
    there is never anyone doing anything...
    <br/>
    it's not hard to throw a glove on real quick to toss a pack..
    <br/>
    or toss it holding a towel as grip...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anything is possible without looking "suspicious"..
    <br/>
    been around here for a hella long time...
    <br/>
    and i've seen over 100+ packages.. not the best and some of the best. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i've seen and heard it all.
    <br/>
    picking up/dropping off is only as intense as the person's mind who is doing it. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    cheers.
