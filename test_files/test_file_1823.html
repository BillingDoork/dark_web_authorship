    My package was seized, what sort of consequences does this have? Is my address now flagged and what does this really imply.

    I am assuming that you got a love letter. 99 percent of the time if its just personal use they will send you a letter saying that you are a naughty boy and have so many days to contest it. Like argue that you should have it. I would say if you got one of those, let it go.. You should have nothing to worry about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got one years ago and for months I kept looking over my shoulder. Do you realize how many they send out a day? If it was something for you to worry about, you wouldn't have received a letter and they would have done a controlled delivery. It looks like that didn't happen, hence you are probably ok.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would probably find another address to use, just as a precaution, but really, it probably still is ok.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Years ago, it was part of the vendors scam. He would collect the money and send a photocopy of a real seizure letter. That way he can claim that it was sent, etc. And you aren't going to complain to anyone as you think it was seized. Im sure that scam is still being used today...

    What I received was a photocopy from customs saying it had been opened and confiscated. So I guess the content has been sent to the police for analysis and perhaps then I will receive the love letter, meaning a fine? All of my machines r encrypted so there is no way to trace that package back to me. Should I challenge it or just pay and be done with it?

    There shouldn't be any fine, they can't prove that you actually ordered it.Â  Just ignore it and use another address for a while.
