    Does it state that it has been seized, or does it just stop updating?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and is 5 business days of no tracking updates reason enough to suspect the package has been seized? Shipped from Australia.

    Thanks and Cheers! - acid999

    It should say something blunt like: Held by customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Something like that..just google the status, usually others have gone through the same experience and asked the same questions you can find on google.

    It's either that or it will stop updating. If it stops updating, then moves out of customs then you are likely to have a controlled delivery.

    Heheh oh the Irony! Im the one that usually tells people "google is your friend." Stupid me for running to the forums instead of doing a simple google search 1st... Anyways I discovered that the tracking only covered the parcel while it was in Australia, and as soon as it left the country. the tracking updates stopped. Whew...I was getting kinda paranoid already...I can take a sigh of relief now:) Thanks b0lixtrader!
