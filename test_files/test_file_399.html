    Hello all. I am starting to grow wary of using Bitinstant and Moneygram to buy BTC because I feel like I'm making too many deposits of large amounts and it may start to seem suspicious. Luckily, I've found a great vendor who is able to do large BTC orders with cash in the mail. However, I know nothing about shipping security, especially with cash. I'm hoping some of you have tips, even basic ones, because I essentially know nothing, I'm new to this method. I obviously use a fake return address, right? Do I change my mail drops regularly? Should I get a fake ID so that I can show the post office my face and a fake name when I send packages? Again, I'm totally new at this, so I'd appreciate any help. I've had a good track record of security so far, I want to make sure that this record doesn't end now because I make a stupid mistake or jump in head first without any idea what I'm doing.

    I'm sick of Bitinstant too and have started to buy my BTC on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There was time when I needed to send large sums of cash on a fairly regular basis - I used UPS &amp; FedEx though, not the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know of one SR BTC vendor who accepts cash in the mail and he also accepts Western Union (CaptainMal).  If you live anywhere near a decent sized town, chances are good that you can find many dozens of Western Union 'agents'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where I live, two of the big grocery store chains have Western Union at their customer service desks.  These two chains operate at least 100 grocery stores within driving distance so I never hit the same one twice, I always use a different name &amp; phone number.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check out the Find Location button on the Western Union site, maybe you'll find lots and lots of Western Union places so you can use them to buy your BTC instead of cash ... if you're interested, of course ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just trying to help out ... Good luck!

    Fuck posting cash in the mail, I can't believe people really do that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your in the US I've heard sugar mama is highly trustworthy for buying coins, must be safer than posting cash, jesus  :-\

    Well, Sugar Mama charges a 10% fee, which is a bit high in my opinion. CaptainMal charges a 6% fee for the same amounts. I'd much rather go there. I've heard that people have no problem sending cash in the mail. You can even have it insured for the amount in the package. Although I admit that it might start to seem suspicious if I'm consistently sending packages insured for like $5,000... I have to make sure I'm being secure.

    localbitcoins.com. Just used it today—hooked me up with a local bitcoin miner, worked fantastically.
