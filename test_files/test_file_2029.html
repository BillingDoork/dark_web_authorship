    New to SR, with 3 successful and promptly paid US-US transactions. But my first two orders, EUR-US, never arrived. One was partially refunded, which I don't like to do because I don't want the refund record. The other has been extended three times - so it's likely it won't arrive. It's been almost 30 days. I'll let it expire and pay it because, again, I don't want a bunch of refunds. Should I just forget about ordering from EUR? These orders were from Netherlands and Austria. Thanks

    Sadly Netherlands packs bound for US get highly scrutinized.Â  I've found a few vendors sending from nether that employ enough tactics to get them through. But the high risk of not receiving is not worth it in most cases imho. Have had no exp with AUS but I know their inbound stuff gets screened a lot as well.

    What about Germany? I see some nice stuff there, but now I'm squeamish about EU shipments.
