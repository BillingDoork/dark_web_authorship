    what you think about this..
    <br/>
    you rent room for couple of days with people that rent out holiday apartments. they usually dont have a own post box
    <br/>
    <br/>
    get your order there (domestic)....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Q:
    <br/>
    do you tell them that you are expecting a letter (which might come across as suspicious, depending on the situation)
    <br/>
    you don't ... which means they might open it (by accident)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any thoughts?

    My thoughts are you are going waay out of your way with these crazy idea when you can just have the stuff sent you a PO BOX you open up or just have it sent to where you live.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if your a young teen or something an still live at home, just get the mail before parents do. I read your other post to and like i said your making something very easy pretty damn difficult.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there a reason you dont wanna send stuff to your own house other than just makes you nervous?

    You can also order things poste restante ("general delivery" for domestic US) if you don't want to order to your house...

    Please do not give children this sort of advice. They should not be shipping things to a home that is not their own, anyway, unless the owner approves.
