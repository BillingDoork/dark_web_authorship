    Hey guys at SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I use the road 100% for personal consumption and only for marijuana, never really ordering more than half an ounce with the exception of the occasional ounce.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm pretty dumb and thusfar have been getting shipments to my house, mainly because I don't have a drop.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How does one go about acquiring a drop house to get shit shipped to? I can't order to my house forever - there is simply too much risk, paranoia and anxiety associated with it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    I think the majority of buyers here also use there home addy for their orders. When you hear people talking of multiple drops, its just others addys that they are permitted to have orders sent to, usually with little ties directly to the buyer. Its not like you have to go buy or rent a house just for a secure drop point. Best of luck.

    if you continiue to have them send to your house, maybe invent a room mate a friend you receive packages for. easier or harder depending on how / where you live.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    might get you off a bit easier if a package is intersepted. also will help you a lot, when your vendor gets busted and they pull out all names / addresses from his printers cache and throw them into a database. Or where ever it may has been saved.

    I am sorry man but I am sure me and MANY others will strongly disagree with you statement. How can doing pot deals on the street be safer then doing so on the road, especially if you are just ordering domestically and since he is only order personal use quantities, there is literally NO risk at all. SO much can go wrong when doing a street drug deal. They would never actually take the time to bust you even if they did intercept the weed, they would simply mail you a notice of seizure at the most and I know plenty of people that have received these for things much worse (law wise) then a half ounce of weed and nothing happened to them and some even continued to order contraband to the same address with no issues (I do not recommend that at all though)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a vendor, I'd say 99% of my orders are being shipped right to the customers home. The other one percent are actually sent to businesses that the customer most likely owns or works at where it is not unusual for them to receive mail at all but obviously I don't ask questions, they provide an address and I ship (unless I noticed they screwed it up in which I will message them first to correct it)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, regarding your post about vendors saving addresses. I know this has happened as vendors have actually admitted to doing it. BUT, any respectable, honest vendor that actually cares about their customers safety DO NOT store addresses in ANY way. There is literally no reason for vendors to save addresses so 99.9% do not and if the law were to seize my business computer there would not even be able to tell  I am using it for anything other then what "normal" people use their computers for. Anything business related is encrypted with TrueCrypt which is a program that not even the FBI has been able to crack into and either way, as soon as addresses are printed to the shipping label the addresses are deleted and the label printing program is totally encrypted to the point that LEO would not even be able to find the program at all, pulling up any "cached" info from my printer would be impossible.

    you sound like a solid vendor. respect mate. but i still disagree here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - many printers save data in the physical cache.
    <br/>
    - true... even if a package of weed is intersepted 80 - 90% of the cases much won't happen. but some cops still go crazy for whatever reason. something you have no control over.
    <br/>
    - you are still very likely to be put into some database of "suspected drug users". something many people migh not care... i actually do. and i think everybody should. (IMHO)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do you still have those corner dealers? of course i wouldn't recommend that. go to a dealers house or meet up some place. or have him drop the product some place, bring him the money and ask where to go... safer for everyone involwed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    about 1 millions americans get arrested for weed / per Y. considering the number of users and deals happening the risk is just not that high on every individual deal. Plus... if you are half way smart, you can decrease the mathemetical odds by at least 95%.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - dress well
    <br/>
    - MBB that shit so it won't stink
    <br/>
    - Don't put it in your pockets / backpack
    <br/>
    - Do it during daylight, eg when coming back from work
    <br/>
    - Use an extra phone / don't talk on the phone
    <br/>
    - Check the area
    <br/>
    - Don't buy from an idiot
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In case police shows up:
    <br/>
    - Don't agree to searches
    <br/>
    - carry ID
    <br/>
    - Yes office / No office
    <br/>
    - Be white
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you follow those rules, your odds of getting busted on a deal are practical nill.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I love the road for choice and such... but in hiscase i stick with what I wrote... look for a good grower close to your house be good to him and its all gonna work out.

    This actually sounds like a really bad idea. If LE decides to make a bust, and you tell them the package belongs to your "roommate", the first thing they're gonna want to know is where to find said "roommate". It wouldn't take them long to find out that your roommate didn't actually exist, and at that point, plausible deniability is right out the window.

    mate... if you do nothing but put a different name next to the door than yes. you got to do your homework.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you have friends over a lot anyways just put an extra bed in a room, throw some sh*t around that isn't yours. give a friend a phone and an prepaid sim and have him call you couple of times. set up an email add.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if they bust you say... yes, thats aguy from capital city. he is here once a while. he doesn't have much money so i let him stay here when he is in the city for cheap. I receive packages for him once a while because he told me.... . he comes and takes them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sure, here is his number ... which ofcourse is disconnected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    don't forget that letters are scanned from the outside in many countries. if a package get intersepted and its just oven an ounce, they might see if there had been more coiming in the past.

    I guess I just wouldn't trust that LE would leave it at that. If they're going to make the effort to investigate, a fake email addy and a disconnected number's not going to be enough to make them leave me alone. That said, I suppose it could work, given the right amount of gullibility/laziness of the cops in an area.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    first thing:
    <br/>
    they won't open a case against YOU, that is !important! which means at first you are not the target. even if the case is dismissed later... in most countries you will still have some kind of record! this way you were just a witness... much better!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    second:
    <br/>
    they might want you to call the number to ask him to come (which you of course will agree to, but as there is an investigation going on, you demand to talk to your lawyer first... that will take a lot of time already).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    then they might try to get the call records, gps location the phone was used at and register information. this will take a lot of time and hopefully a warrent. additionally you can send them down a rabbit hole by giving info like he said that he attended that university and looks like that, you saw them on that website once... odds are high that will lead to nothing. cops know that. and even if they get the guy... he still likely will claim that he didn't order them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also this way you provide a good way out for the cops. look at it this way..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    case#1:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    drugs addressed to owner of the property. owner denies knowledge. cops can't proof a thing. write that in report. cops know, odds are you are guilty .. even worst... boss of cop know that too. ---&gt; boss of cop unhappy. (blame cop for not being able to bend you over and f### you.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    case#2:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    drugs addressed to person that was not to be found. Contact information could be obtained from cooperating room mate. The amount of efford needed to track down that person have estimated to be high. Cop write in report that the room mate has been given a warning + suggests to boss not to concern further with this. Boss less unhappy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
