    I am in the us and i will only be buying Bud (weight varies from 1lb and up) and MAYBE some blow just for a few buddies.... i understand outside the u.s it might have to pass customs and from what i gather it will take longer and probably risky, please give me many opinions and stories of success with these products and vendors you have had success with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    whenever i am searching for vendors and products should i keep it domesticly only? how crucial is this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thank you guys, always a pleasure to talk!

    I'd recommend it.  It's generally assumed that domestic is safer.  Especially with those quantities. :P Best of luck.

    He's trolling. As the Netherlands is a known drug producing country it's widely accepted that packages from there are more closely scrutinized. I personally won't order from there as I consider it too much of a risk, but I also know of plenty of people who have had success, even into countries that are supposed to have extra tight customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's all risk vs reward though, so do your research first, especially before ordering internationally.

    USA customs is extremely lax.  I have been shipping there for 14 months without a single issue.  Look at the turmoil in the mail system right now- the push for a 5-day week, early retirements, closing sorting facilities.  They are obviously going to be doing the same volume with less people and fewer facilities.  Now does that mean mail will get more scrutiny than before?  Yes, you guessed it.  And the employees that are left are going to be even more pissed off than they have been in the past.  If you expect disgruntled employees to operate at 100% efficiency you are naive.  If you expect disgruntled government workers to operate at 100% efficiency, you are delusional.  The post office is full of people who are simply putting in time until the day they can cash out and go fishing.  There are loads of them!  I am not saying that there are no postal inspectors who are gung-ho law and order types, but they are few and far between.  Mostly they are bureaucrats at heart and in performance.  Push a bureaucrat to do twice as much work and see how that works out for you.

    OP,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been asking myself the same question for a while now and the above basically sums it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems to me your looking to sell so only you can weigh the pros and cons of ordering internationally. There are often more options and sometimes the prices are better but it is, without a doubt, slightly more risky. How much more? No one can put a percentage on it. I'd also agree that a package from the Netherlands or maybe China is more suspect than from say, Canada. Still, no one can put a percentage on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, unless you have received packages from abroad before its my inkling that if regular shipments start showing up someone may notice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also haven't seen much discussion about international shipments in regards to large quantities although I imagine that wouldn't get talked about much.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly I'd tend to agree that weed is probably one of the hardest/riskiest things to receive from any source but more so from another country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The above is purely speculation based on reading these forums for a while. Do lots of people have success getting international shipments? Yes. Will you? There are too many variables to say with much certainty. It's also totally possible you do everything right and just get the shit side of variance.
