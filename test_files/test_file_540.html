    I would like know what countries in European Union are hardest and what are easiest to reach by mail (not domestic).
    <br/>
    From EU to EU and from outside of EU to EU.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think i need a picking point in some neighbour country because this is not looking good at all.

    Just choose a vendor with good feedback and good stealth comments. Vendors that use quality stealth techniques have an extremely high success rate to any destination around the world. Lots of undelivered orders are actually selective scamming rather than customs seizing your order. Make sure you stay in Escrow to maximize your chance of success.

    I've recently made loads of orders to fulfill my need of things, similar products are in your listing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But im still looking for a Clomiphene Citrate and Anastrazole but only a small amount to make some tests on myself. :)
    <br/>
    Many vendors who sell pills have issues with my country, i just got a message from 1 vendor that said the following: "We always send tracked and signed packages and of the last 8 packages sent to ******* only 1 got through the customs...Â  In the same period of time, only 2 packages were seized by customs in all other countries together".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not funny at all.

    I would be interested on the success rates of shipments from NL to Germany/Switzerland/Austria.
    <br/>
    Any vendor recommendations for these routes?

    I think if you live in EU and want international shipments they should register an inexpensive mail forwarding account in UK. 100%
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NL/Germany are the most difficult. The Indians cant ship anything direct to EU 90% seizure
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Re-route mail through UK then its 100%
