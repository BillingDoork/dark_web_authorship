    I placed an order from two seperate OS vendors last week. One was a decent sized order (nice amt of weight)  and the other order for  one gram of a white powder. Today when I brought the mail in I saw that I had a package and a letter. The package contained my big order but the envelope (shipped from the vendors country) contained two pieces of paper, one with my address and one blank. Letter was still sealed but no drugs :( . Could this be the work of customs? And how did my huge order come thru but they caught the smaller one? And the envelope was still sealed too..
    <br/>
    Does this sound like a theiving postal worker or can/would customs do this for a one gram order? Should I be expecting a love letter tomorow? someone please advise!
    <br/>
    Trusted members or Mods feel free to PM me for more details, I'd rather not publish it all here..

    Sounds to me like your vendor accidently fucked up? Could be that he had the orders set up to be packaged and got distracted by something and when he came back to packaging he brain farted and sealed your envelope without putting your powder in. Hope ya get it sorted without any fuss mate :)

    I think it was probably a mistake from the vendor
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one of my packages from SR came with a hole punched through it.. I think customs might punch holes in the package if they are suspicious of whats inside

    yeah as canada420 mentioned. Most of the time, when customs look through your stuff they'll leave a tiny hole (what they use to get your sample out to test for drugs). However good they are at opening packages and re-sealing them to look like they've never been opened.....it doesn't work
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if your package was sealed. Looked completely untouched AND you say your big order arrived I'd have a little chat with your vendor and ask him whatsup.

    If you want to Err on the side of caution then obv, change drop locations
