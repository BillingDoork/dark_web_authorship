    Is one method of receiving your package scrutinised or processed differently to the other or are they processed exactly the same? I'm talking int orders here.

    I'm looking to get stuff sent to the work po box. A courier picks up the mail and delivers it to us. Every week we get mail from people who worked here years ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Reason I'm doing this is because only one of my last three orders arrived at my home address. And it was the middle order which is weird.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do u think?

    if you have full control over it then do it..
    <br/>
    it would be pretty easy to deny..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so ur saying one of your three international orders arrived? if so maybe use a new vender
    <br/>
    then again international is always a bit risky you never know with it.. stay domestic and pay the little bit extra is what i suggest unless
    <br/>
    ur a re seller .. but shit even then u can still make some money

    Yep the work po box is pretty anonymous only issue is the very public nature if things went wrong. I keep thinking of customs/police coming into the office enquiring about drugs arriving in the mail  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The one that did arrive (second one) was from a relatively new vendor. First one from a mega popular and successful vendor and last one prob a step down from the first guy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The inconsistency of things has led me to try new delivery options which I didn't want to do.
