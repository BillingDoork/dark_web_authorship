    Hello Community,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I have an issue and I need some feedback. I have scoured this forum and haven't found much regarding my specific concern except to say "You shouldn't do that.. it could be bad" I sent out a package quite recently containing multiple, but less than 3 ounces of a certain beloved schedule I phenethylamine -- domestic -- Express. The package went from a business name to a business name-- the receiving end an apartment. The return address is one that used to exist on a street in the same zip code it was dropped from that has worked just fine in the past. I took great care with the inside of the package was sure to use cotton gloves etc, triple vac seal, color barriers &amp;&amp; Tyvek. The labels were printed and an Express stamp was used. The envelope was no thicker than a small stack of documents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I KNOW FOR A FACT the address was correct. PERHAPS because it was a fake business name that wasn't associated to that address, they wouldn't deliver it. I contacted USPS from a pitch phone and they said they weren't sure why, but the address was wrong and it would be returned. I believe this package may have been flagged for some reason. Even if it was not flagged it will not be returnable, and will eventually be opened by USPS to seek return address information, and subsequently sent to forensics. Right???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I highly doubt they would be able to lift usable prints from it, and the receiving address has been notified to the situation so hopefully they will take all the appropriate precautions. My only concern is that before there was an issue I tracked this package from my home internet connection. I know this was careless and I regret it but I've never had anything go missing in years. Hindsight is a bitch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm currently taking all precautions -- i'm going to replace my hard drive and dispose of the old one. I'm going to be absolutely positive my home has ZERO evidence of any kind… indefinitely…
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How worried should I be?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I being overly paranoid?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there anything else I should be doing?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All information is appreciated.
