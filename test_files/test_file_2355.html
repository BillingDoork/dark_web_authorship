    I've been reading up on this "controlled delivery" stuff. When I signed up for silk road I read "never sign for deliveries," but in my one track mind moment all  I cared about was getting the package and having some sort of insurance, despite the obvious red flag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else ordered from peoplesdrugstore using tracking in the US (or anywhere) and had to sign.. successfully?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am very much contemplating declining the package, if it's there. I share a home (I am not the owner), I have so much crap in my home, if I went to the PO (don't have a mailbox at my house - live in very small rural town) and picked up the package and that gave the police the right to come in and tear everything apart (with no consideration, as they do) of everyone's... It looks like a tornado now, I can't imagine the police coming in with a search warrant, even if I got rid of anything possibly illegal. The thought of cleaning up that mess is causing a borderline panic attack.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, anyone accept their package with signing?
    <br/>
    I probably won't now I've thought of it (I'm honestly hoping for a customs letter instead), I should have just chose regular shipping. There goes $120ish. I just want some good powder H dammit. I'm pretty much looking for reasons to accept the package.
    <br/>
    If there's nobody at the PO except the one person who is always there is it possible that it's still a sketchy scenario? Or would that not be because it wouldn't be very "controlled"?
    <br/>
    Sorry if this is in the wrong place/scattered I'm in a very paranoid mindset.

    For anyone that was in the same boat as me, I got the package. The woman at the PO was like "sign this" and so i said I don't know what the is? And she flashed it at me. I have never been able to say no, so I signed it and took it. Let it sit in the car at home for a few hours, then couldn't wait any longer to find out what was up. Everything was fine and their stealth tactics are great. Not vacuum sealed though, not sure if that would have *really* made a difference.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never again will I order something that has to be signed.

    Yeah, thank you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was certainly surprised at their stealth, it was pretty awesome but the different hand writing freaked me out a bit hah
