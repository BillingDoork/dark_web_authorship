    Someone wants to order heroin and then "burn" the address as a precaution against ordering more and getting addicted. The current plan is to confront the mail man and complain that someone had ordered weed to the address in his name, make a report to the USPS/postmaster, and do any follow up interviews with police that might occur. Afterwards, sending some weed through the mail to test (not involving any actual vendors) if the mail is actually being watched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This person has an addictive personality (daily binge drinking 10+ years, history of cocaine addiction, generally over doing whatever is available) and there really isn't a doubt about whether this person could handle an unlimited ongoing supply of H. It seems to be the best wrong-way out of this situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice or tips other than "This is stupid, don't do it?"

    How bout just no heroin if it means INTENTIONAL contact with the police and some hare-brained scheme afterward. You're asking for trouble.

    Sounds stupid, don't do it.

    Forget the idiocy of your plan with the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't give someone you know to have an addictive personality heroin.

    You could always rent a mailbox from the ups store after you burn this address. It's always good to burn the address about once a month, and use only a single address for really big risky stuff one time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now that you know, it would be stupid to burn the address.
