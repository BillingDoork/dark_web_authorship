    I am considering ordering similar products from two different vendors. Is there any way to distinguish?

    Some have used slight differences in shipping addresses. Maybe a first initial for one, and full name for the other. All caps vs lower case?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can also message the vendors and ask if they can tell you something about the package to identify it.

    I don't usually buy the same stuff in the same amounts from different vendors so I usually know who sent the package. Depending on what I'm ordering I use a business name (I'm Canadian; I'm not sure if the US or elsewhere will deliver to a business addressed package without proper registration), or my real name, or for larger shipments I hire someone as a drop who has no suspicious paper trail. The business I use is registered, but in Canada that's irrelevant. You can address your mail to any name or phrase and you should get the package so long as you have your Postal Code, Street Name/No. and Town/Province. From my understanding, USPS records a lot of information about addressees.
