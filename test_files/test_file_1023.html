     The following items, namely, # grams of cannabis, are liable to forfeiture on the grounds that they are controlled drugs and were imported into the country from Mexico, contrary to section 3(1) of the misuse of drugs act 1971 and section 49(1)(b) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you claim that the items are not liable to forfeiture you must within one month of the date shown above, give notice in writing of your clam to the above office of UK Border Force (UKBF), stating your full name and address.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you make such a claim within that time, legal proceedings in a Magistrates Court will be taken for condemnation of the items. These are civil rather than criminal proceedings at which you or your legal representative should be present to rshow cause why the goods should not be forfeited. It will then be a matter for the Court to decide whether or not the goods are liable to forfeiture. The Court, that is wholly independent of the UKBF, will also decide the question of costs. If no such claim in made, the items will be deemed to have been duty condemned as forfeited.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you are in doubt about the effect of this Seizure Notice, you may consult the office named above or, if you prefer, a solicitor.

    Given the fact that you are a vendor as well as a buyer here, I sincerely hope that you changed the quantity that was written on the notice when you posted it. I've taken the liberty of asking a mod to edit it in any case; hope you don't mind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There wouldn't be a huge number of people getting notices for exactly "X grams of cannabis", and were you simply a buyer I wouldn't feel the need to say the above but the fact that you are also a vendor selling the kinds of products that you do gives the police an incentive to find you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you did indeed post the exact amount as stated on the notice, all it will take is one or two phone calls from the police to customs and they'll have a very, very short list of names and addresses of people that you could be.

    If the address is not linked to you then in theory you could chance using it again but personally I don't think it's worth the risk. Burn it and get a new one.

    I've received up to 10 love letters per address.  International shipments still get through.  I stop using the addresses after several months and up to 10 seizure notices.  If it's a schedule 1 or schedule 2 then I stop after the first seizure.

    Appreciate the look at one of these. Interesting format - definitely carrying the tone that nothing further is going to happen on their end - only if you contest the forfeiture (and thereby claim ownership) does it go any further. Nice to not be left wondering (except for whether/when you can use that address again).

    Got my first one of these today. Bricked it at first, now I'm just gutted.

    May be a stupid question but does this impact non-international orders in any way at all? Will border force pass my details on to the cops/royal mail to be put on a watch list or is it just border force who will be looking out for my address?

    With so many forged documents going around, anybody think it could be possible to fake a "Seizure Letter" and it actually came from a scam-vendor?

    Not in the US.  It either comes with customs tape on it or the usual way, in business envelope with CBP and their address laser printed on it and with your address in a window.

    The one I got came on really shit quality paper so that was my first thought but 100% sure it couldn't have been faked. Had stamped paid for postage coming from the correct place and also a stamped and correctly dated border force sign on the front.Way too legit for the cheap, shitty vender who sent the product in the first place.

    This happened to me just over a year ago, the exact same letter from UK borderforce for fake good from china, obv. i didn,t persue it either but the company just sent the stuff again and it got through the 2nd time. Never had a problem with an order for drugs or fake goods since  ;)

    It's fine dude, you got a letter not a warrant for an arrest. Just take it easy with that address for a while and find another one -they can't link multiple addresses to you if theyre not under your name. You used a fake name right?
