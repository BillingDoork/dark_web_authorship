     Anti-narcotics sleuths (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anti-narcotics-sleuths) have seized multiple drug parcels that were couriered to foreign shores from a  post office (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/post-office) in the heart of the national capital. The about two kg of the narcotics consignment had returned after they failed to get delivered at the addresses given in  Estonia (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Estonia),  Canada (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Canada),  Russia (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Russia) and  Sri Lanka (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sri-Lanka).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The drug cache was intercepted by sleuths of the Delhi unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau late Wednesday from Returned Letter Office located in Jhandewalan. The five parcels contained 715 g of heroin and some charas.

    I think I saw a post or thread that said not to go to the post office if they say to come get your package.

    Like roxy said, too bad.  The pkgs made is ALL THE WAY to their destinations and passed through customs without a problem, but were not able to be deivered for whatever reason.  No sleuthing at all if the return address was fake or there was not one, the agents would have just opened the pkg and if the stealth was poor, bam.  What do you bet these 'agents' sell the seized H to their friends though for a little extra cash, who end up selling it all over again. ;)
