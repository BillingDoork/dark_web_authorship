    I don't have too much of an option in my situation. I am a spouse living on a small army post in the middle of nowhere. I understand the risks of receiving a package at your home address, but is there more of a chance of me getting caught cause I'm on post?
    <br/>
    I would only be receiving a schedule III item andÂ  I only expect to get letter envelope sized packages,.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, what does FE refer to? I've been looking it up but I have failed to find an answer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you for your time.

    no there's no more of a chance b/c of army base most packages are pretty stealth its the same risk wherever and FE means finalize early which you should never do

    When my friend was serving I would send him whatever he wanted, even edibles. I would just make them look like they were from a relative and do the usual stealth packing and no one ever found out.
