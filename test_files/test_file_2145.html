    I was wondering my friend is in the military and just went for a urine test, the night before he had over 300mg methylone. The test came back as a negative. I was wondering if this is the case that it does not show up as amphetamine, methamphetamine etc is customs able to test it on the spot and get a positive reading?? Or do they have to send it to a lab?? Which would obviously take several days..  ???

    Depends on the test. I can't tell you how in depth a military drug test is, but as a comparison if it were a drug test for a job then no it most likely wouldn't show up since most companies don't want to pay for full out drug tests. If it were a test for probation, he most likely would have tested positive since they test for far more substances.

    I am confident military and probation would be the same. The military drug test is quite extensive.

    If it's a thorough lab test, then yes I would expect the test to be positive.

    Methylone should never be detected if someone is testing for amphetamines since it's a beta ketone substituted cathinone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Furthermore, bath salts have only recently been banned in the U.S., therefore, it will probably be some time before they (mdpv, mephedrone, methylone, etc.) are added to the standard military contraband urine test.

    Very much depends on what test is being used, the results are highly subjective depending on this factor. I have never been tested myself but I have heard tell of M1 coming up as a false positive for MDMA, Amphetamine, Ice but also nothing at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I say it's all a bit of pot luck depending on what test is used. Before it was banned though you could ask for retests to confirm it wasn't what the false positive came back as but that's really here-nor-there now because it's pretty much banned everywhere.

    Well last year there was only 1 lab in the US that tested for synthetic cannabinoids(sp?) and that it only tested for 2 or 3 of them.  I'm relatively certain that at the time, it was also the only lab in the US to test for M1 and meph. I believe the only practical way to test for them is GC/MS and Redwood Labs in Cali was where they did that testing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my assumption is that even if a person asked for them to send it to the lab for confirmation it would show that it was a false positive, but probably not show up as M1 specifically.  I took a drug test for probation.  while high on M1 and passed just fine. Even when i was caught with bud, they 'sent it off to the lab' but the prosecutor kept saying things like, "we don't have to wait for the test results because we know what it actually was, right?" so i interpreted that as they didn't want to spend resources testing to stick you with the charges if they could get you to admit to it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    keep in mind, the first paragraph is based on my memory from a year ago,  can't guarantee it's the same now.

    As a general rule, RC's are pretty safe when it comes to drug testing. Most won't come back as anything on the 5-panel, but I've heard some reports of certain RC's giving false positives, however this is generally cleared up with the GC/MS test, UNLESS they are specifically testing for whatever substance it is you've taken.

    Hey, when you take a piss test at meps, it's the same as the one you take at your recruiters office. It checks for amph, coke, wed, and opiates. I've taken multiple for the military and have passed all of them. Anyways, I'm not sure how they handle active duty random pissers. Better just not fuck about when in the service and have a ball afterwards.
