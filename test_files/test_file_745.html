    I've ordered three times from a domestic vendor who sells crystal mdma.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UK - Domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First two packages arrived no probs after about 48hrs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The 3rd package hasn't arrived. It's been a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I messaged the vendor and they said it should've been there by now given the postage options they chose. (1st class royal mail).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, I only have one delivery address. No drops possible in my situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question is this..
    <br/>
    Is my address now burned? Or is it more to do with the vendor's packaging method and/or sorting office location? I'm clueless about the chain of events that take place between standard first class sendout and doorstep arrival.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What should I do? Write the whole thing off (SR), or try a different vendor?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also worth noting, I've received xtc from the NL with zero problems. 72hr delivery in-fact.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh, and we're not talking Pablo Escobar type amounts here, I only order 1g - 2g per order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My tin-foil hat is on stand-by. lol...

    Don't go into major paranoid panic mode just yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had similar situations when my SR post's been slow &amp; I've been obsessing over it, worrying about not getting other pieces of post &amp; watching out for the police. Nothing came of it and after a while I got my packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still better safe than sorry, if you haven't already done so completely clear house of all drugs &amp; parifanalia, parifin, parifa,,, gear and just sit tight for a while. Either you'll get your stuff or you'll get a knock from the old bill. If it's the 2nd you've got nothing incriminating so no need to worry.

    It is highly unlikely it was seized being a domestic order. Only things that could have happened is;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. It was never sent
    <br/>
    2. It was stolen
    <br/>
    3. It was lost

    Yeah, the 100% refund was a surprise. He asked me what I wanted to do about it. I said I'd either like a re-ship, or I'll just take the 50% refund (quoted on his vendor page). 5 minutes later I had a 100% refund.
    <br/>

    meh, I've written it off. And him, tbh.

    sending mail recorded is about 3x the price, more hassle and puts the vendor at a lot more risk. hardly any uk vendors offer this service especially for small amounts and all recorded mail has to be signed for.

      If I had to guess, id say it was lost. If it was only a gram or two, think how long it would take them to examine all the letters, every day.

     sending mail recorded is about 3x the price, more hassle and puts the vendor at a lot more risk. hardly any uk vendors offer this service especially for small amounts and all recorded mail has to be signed for.

    It is easy enough to get the prepaid special delivery bags with cash, then you can use those for tracked shipping.

    Disadvantage obviously being that the buyer would have to sign for it and it costs something like £6, so it's only worth it for the sort of orders that nobody should be signing for anyway.
