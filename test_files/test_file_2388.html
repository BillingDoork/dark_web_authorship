    So you are saying that you have waited a total of 3 days and are already messaging the vendor "where is my package"   all I can say is..... glad im not a vendor.   Postal services are normally regular but as mail can fluctuate in delivery and even you have stated no previous issues with vendor cut them some slack man. after 5 business days I might think of a note but probably would go to 7 days.

    If you order was never sent across International boundaries than customs probably doesn't have it. Either 1 of 3 things:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Vendor hasn't sent it yet
    <br/>
    2) Local LE intercepted it
    <br/>
    3) It's at the bottom of some mail bag and will arrive shortly
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When wiggleroom says you don't have to accept it I think he means you don't have to finalize on the Bitcoins in Escrow.
