    It took them forever to send me the notice and I have to say it's worded pretty strong.  The first thing I noticed was what they say they confiscated is way off.  They are saying they took 16g's of K.  I've never bought that much before so I'm assuming they are trying to make it sound more threatening situation than it really is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone offer a suggesting here?  Should I lay off SR for a while?  How big a deal is this?
    <br/>
    I wish there were more US venders.  I've had great luck with OS venders but I guess it's time I get even more cautious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    What else did it say? Also, how long ago was this order? How long between the order and the notice?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the worst it says is that they confiscated the substance, I wouldn't stress it THAT badly... Don't get me wrong I'd still be shitting bricks, but I would just keep your nose clean for a while. If it was confiscated recently, I would maybe just put everything incriminating in a safe off your property for a few days... JUST to be safe.. But, if they are nice a enough to send you a letter, chances are they are not going to come knocking.. Why would they? They would have done it already...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dispose of any evidence of how it was obtained. Keep your shit clean for a little while and watch your post for a while, you should be fine

    if you have ever seen those border wars shows where they get like 100's of bundles and then weigh the bundles still wrapped and include the wrapper in the weight.

    Bulllllshit. THe OP is lucky he got a love letter for what they are calling 16 grams of K, he could have very well had a CD over that. There was just a story of someone who had a CD for half a sheet of acid. I have never heard of schedule ones being intercepted with out a CD for any amount. K is schedule III. I have only definitively heard of CDs for schedule V + , marijuana seeds and research chemicals. But a love letter from a small amount of a schedule III is believable. People who say only massive orders get CD are completely full of shit though. if they only did love letters for small amounts every trafficker and their grand mother would just swarm the shit out of product and split kilos up into a hundred ten gram packs.

    HA kmfkew bullshit?? I was just giving a past experience the last thing im gonna do is bullshit about what i know happend to me over an anonymous website.  my package was some knock off pharms, 500 of them.  i dont know what u wanna call massive amounts but i think 500 pills from china is a little more then a personal supply.  Think about how much shit they find in the mail everyday, for them to go out and bust everyone with more then 16 grams of K is not goin to happen.  I got a letter for 500 pills that was it real experience, real talk.  so fuck you and what ever you heard on this internet.

    Not to hijack the thread, but Cache is right.  You are  a vendor here.  Most people look up vendors on the forum before buying (I know I do).  If you seem like a dick, you will lose orders - seriously.  I'm just looking out for you bro.  Change the attitude.  Take it for what you will.

    It's been a few months now I have not received a visit from LE.  I have tried to order from overseas again and so far no letter but no package either.  It's clear I'm on a watch list.

    I don't have any experience with LE and this kind of stuff but here's what I think.  I doubt they will come after me for a few grams.  I'm not worried.  Logic dictates they can't possibly go after everyone.  Since I have no rap sheet and my amounts have been small.  I"m pretty sure I'm in the clear except for being on the watch list.

    All that being said, the government doesn't usually do what's logical so there's always a chance.  Now I can only order from sellers in the US.  This blows because there are so few US sellers and their prices tend to be higher than EU sellers.  I guess we've got to count our blessings this site is here and I can still order anything at all!

    Sucks when an address gets flagged.  Where were your expected orders coming from?  I have had a pack seized....and then possibly another (vendor selectively scammed I think), but one from Canada made it during all this.   Wonder if the point of entry for the pack makes a difference.

    if it's domestic, I'm not going to bother ordering it here. I can probably already find it within an hours drive from my front door. I only use the site to get stuff that isn't around locally. Also, a few years ago a friends friend was importing large amounts of ketamine and all kinds of RCs through those trade websites. Alibaba. etc and they must've cottoned on to it at some point but would let them through but kept count / track. Only for a short time and then he had them come visit and when they came, they were looking for the 500g+ of ketamine they had accounted for that was suddenly missing. It was enough to get him prison time for distribution. Though they can't of been that clever because he did one last ketamine order during his last week of freedom.

    Since I got the letter I've placed a few very small orders from various places in EU and one in Canada.  They've all been caught by customers so I stopped ordering international.  It's a pain for me and the sellers to deal with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I may have found a way around the problem.  I placed a tiny meth order a couple weeks ago.  Only 0.1g and had it sent to my address but attention to the guy who lived here before me. I get his mail all the time (I think he died and the family didn't tell the post office). Funny enough it came though.  I FE early and left the seller 5 stars.  I had no intention of trying to get my money back if the package didn't come in.
    <br/>
    I'm not sure if it made it though because the name and address on the package didn't match their flagged records or if it was just a fluke because the the amount was so small.  At some point I'll place a larger order and see what happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll be happy to post the customs letter if I can find it.  I know I kept it but not sure where it ended up  ;)  Once I find it I'll scan it into a jpg or something and post it up here.  The wording is very strong and clearly designed to scare the crap out of you.  But whatever.... I still don't think they are going to come after me for personal use quantities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wish I could just find a local seller for K so I didn't have to order it.  I was at a concert recently and few people were passing around a bag.  I heard someone say it was K so I asked if I could buy a G from them.  They sold it to me for $60 and it was damn good stuff.  But he didn't want any reoccurring business so I'm still on the lookout.

    If I was LE I would use different wording on all the letters I send out.  That way when people scan a JPG of their letter, and they think they have blacked out all personally identifying information, I can still link their forum account to the letter since the wording is unique.

    Over the years I've had numerous LL's, and I know they didn't keep track back then for small orders (personal use benzos/codeine) b/c most reships made it just fine.

    That's odd you've had seizures after the first K seizure, which btw is regarded much differently than h/coke/meth due to K being schedule 3.  I've had two seizures over the years and placed multiple international orders without a hiccup.  Even had 20 grams of K get to me from NL a couple of times.  Vials of K from when Dr. Nilesh was selling them.

     If I was LE I would use different wording on all the letters I send out.  That way when people scan a JPG of their letter, and they think they have blacked out all personally identifying information, I can still link their forum account to the letter since the wording is unique.

     I was at a concert recently and few people were passing around a bag.  I heard someone say it was K so I asked if I could buy a G from them.  They sold it to me for $60 and it was damn good stuff.
