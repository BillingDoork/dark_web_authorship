    Hello fellow SR'ers, now that USPS has nixed the white/green DCN labels, what options do we have for anonymous shipping? I heard that they still accept the DCN labels but that some have reported it takes longer (7 days) for the item to arrive, and I've also heard that you can't drop them into the blue boxes anymore...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can you drop priority envelopes in the blue boxes without tracking? What about with the old labels? Someone mentioned being able to generate tracking without USPS help at all, but I don't know what the deal is with that...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So any suggestions you may have, please share, I don't have a ton of ideas at this point but feel its better to lose a shipment and send it anonymously using first-class mail than to go into the USPS office and ship out packages in person for the sake of tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best,
    <br/>

    This is a topic that I'm trying to figure out myself right now.  It's pretty hard to discuss to in a public forum as you don't want LEO getting wind of it.  The best way it to invest the time and try to figure it out.  I'm now going on a week of trying to figure this out and it's somewhat of a bitch I'll admit.

    You can't drop a priority box into a blue box with a tracking sticker on it?  You have to go into the Post office if the box has a tracking sticker?

     Did you actually get the Vanilla Visa to work or are you just assuming that it would work without actually trying it?  Because it keeps telling me to use another card and I don't want to spend another $30 on a card that won't work any better than the one I already have.  I remember people saying that USPS does not accept gift cards so I thought that was why they are telling me to use a different card.

    Vanilla Visa DOES work for shipping. While I didn't use it to ship illegal goods, I shipped something with it from ebay since I won one from some contest. I also used a prepaid american express gift card to ship a label as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just make sure you dont check your balance on Tor or anything like that, might flab the card

    you can walk into any office and buy the $5.80 stamp as long as the pack is under 14 or 16 oz I have to ask again, it can be dropped in any blue usps drop box. If its over 14/16 OZ it must be dropped inside a usps lobby counter...or you could drop it at a mom an pop mail store? there is always a way to do things. Oh and when you buy the stamps they give you a print out sheet of sticky tracking numbers to attach to it as well.

    vanilla visa doesnt work with buying anything online cause you have to have a card thats has a physical address and you cant register a physical address  with one of those cards, jesus fucking noobs just use the search engines to see how 500 people cant be wrong
