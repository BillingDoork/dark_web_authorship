    There is a great listing on BMR for just what you have in mind. They have varying sizes, an aluminum layer for the x-ray, a ziplock seal and the ability to be heat sealed as well. They claim to be highly odor proof. I think that the seller above me is a better deal by far, but the convenience of having these made into uniform baggies is just too much for me to pass up.

    Don't believe the claims that they are x-ray proof, they are not, I don't know why they make such claims.
    <br/>
    The food grade bags are good, but they are only 3 ply, not 5 ply like mine, my stuff is much stronger :)

    I have ZERO to gain by posting this just to get that out of the way. I've paid for my order and long since received it, but I can 100% reccomend PlutoPetes product hands down over anything I've ever tried out of all the matErials I've ever experimented with. It's so easy to work with and speeds up the process ten fold. They see much stronger, heavier-duty feelings, but at the same time, the maternal I'd EXTREMELEY flexible and takes NO time to seal. The best part is custom size bags that require you be able to cut out the appropriate size for what you need to fit in it. I can whole-heartedly say it would be very difficult to get me to use anything else.
