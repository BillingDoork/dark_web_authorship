    Hi I've got a problem a big problem actually. My mail is disappearing out of my box and its almost always my S.R orders only. I'm the only one who has a key and I doubt someone is stealing it but on 3 separate vendors this has happened the mail just doesn't make it and disappears into the black triangle. not bullshitting i got  no letters from usps saying this is what happened, no nothing its the weirdest thing I ever saw.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other stuff like bills almost always has np making its the contraband that keeps disappearing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What should I do about it I feel like complaining but I'm not sure if that's smart?

    Find a new drop.  Get a PO box or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Complaining at this point in time isn't going to help you.  If you want your revenge on the mailman, catch him stealing a legal package... maybe one you sent to yourself that could look similar to your SR deliveries, but legal, tracked etc.

    Have you been talking to friends about your orders?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had issues more than once where a customer complains to have not gotten a package, only to find out later his room mate or neighbour was taking them after hearing what was in it.

    This is a PO Box I have and I'm the only one with a key. No I keep my orders private especially when I'm expecting a new one but certain people do notice when I have gotten my order if you know what I mean. Never authorities and I never go to the P.O box like that.

    but do you think it was disappearing on the transit or someone was stealing on your mailbox?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also havn't you thought that maybe can be that customs have found a package time ago and now you got your address get flagged or something?

    How do you know they are being taken OUT of the box rather then not making it all together? Stop sending stuff to that box because it doesn't have to be a mailman taking it they could be saving up all your shipments to make a case they rarely do that but i have personally seen it happen..

    Is it possible a previous owner of the box made a copy of the key in order to steal mail?  Another thing could be you have a dishonest postal employee stealing your mail.  Or IMO the least likely like someone else mentioned is they're saving all your packages and trying to make a case against you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Def. seems odd.  You're using good reliable longstanding vendors, right?

    Honestly I think some how someone at the postal service is on to me and is taking them and destroying that mail which really pisses me off. That's just what it seems like how could I get revenge on them dishonest or not this is bullshit and I would like advice on how you would get their revenge without putting themselves in jeopardy???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also i never buy International never and from what I understand I should receive some kind of letter with some kind of explanation I have never gotten anything. They can't just take your mail like that can they??? That doesn't seem right doesn't make sense to me!!

    Honey, why would you get revenge if you're in the wrong either way you are getting illegal packages if the mail man IS the one behind all of this he can screw you over faster then you can say screw you over. I suggest honestly get over it with some relaxing peaceful music,new PO box or new drop addy.

    Even if your mail got intercepted and u did order international. They do not always send "LOVE LETTERS" letting you know they are gonna throw away your shit unless u can provide legit need for it.. I have a friend and between me and Him we have had over 300 order international, iv been lucky and never lost 1 single parcel domestic or foreign , but he on the other hand has lost or not received like 5 or 6 packs over close to 2 years..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    aRE you sure your vendor is even sending your parcels? do u have tracking #s to prove items have been sent or r u just going by the vendors word?

    You said "almost always" your SR stuff.
    <br/>
    1. Does SR stuff sometimes get through and does other non-SR stuff get taken?
    <br/>
    2. Is it lettermail or bubble packages or boxes? A mix of them all?

    They could be picking the ones that are all in padded envelopes which are common with SR vendors. Maybe if it's anything besides a letter someone who has access just nabs it.
