    labelprinters are very expensive, here locally in the Netherlands at the action store (a european discount chain) you can get 15 sheets A4 size with 24 labels each for €0.98 (360 labels). A comparable roll for a labelprinter costs €19 at the office supply store here, for 220 labels! DYMO labelprinters cost another €80,-, for which you can get a new inkjet printer as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An inkjet printer can print directly to envelopes as well, and it's easy to use a program like coreldraw to put the addresses in the right spots for an a4 sheet. You can even use a sheet more than once. basically one label off a roll for a DYMO labelprinter is more expensive than a whole A4 sized sheet with 24 labels. The only benefit is that you get a label at a time.

    I disagree.

    I got my label printer for $40. It uses laser printing technology and came with a free roll off 100 address labels. The included software also has various formats to choose from. You can also using different size rolls with different size labels, I'm sure the refills are like $10-20 something, but totally worth it imo. Also has a 30 day return, if you not satisfied policy.

    It's pretty fucking sweet.

    Originally I was gonna get the $100 one, but they were sold out and I'm glad they were.

    just looking at the brother label printing options, and brother indeed seems a less expensive alternative than Dymo. Now this is forum dynamics leading to usable information for ya! ;)
