    I plan to ship MDMA, 1-5 grams orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I plan to put it in a small ziploc bag, use mylar bag, bubble mailer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I cannot find any vacuum sealers which will do under 3" x 3" , also from that thread about shipping safety a lot of people siad mylar bag is good enough on small quantities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice/?

    Everything you need to know has been posted already. DOUBLE mylar bag and heat seal it. Make sure to clean the first mylar bag so that there is no residue left on the outside, then seal the second bag. Make sure it looks clean and professional... again, all of this has been written about extensively in the forums already.

    You shouldn't have to ask shit like this - now your potential customers are going to be a little weary of ordering seeing as you actually need to ask what you should be using to package.

    <br/>
    Other than that little lecture.. Double seal and clean everything.Â  :)

    But perhaps it's still better for him to package correctly rather than risk a faulty setup. I mean really, it's not like every vendor has a unique way of shipping stuff...it's all pretty much the same methods save for a few special vendors.

    Yes, there's no need for a vacuum sealer if you have mylar bags and an impulse sealer. Vacuum sealing is good for sucking the air out of packages of cannabis, or to suck the air out of a package of pills so they don't rattle or grind against each other. Vacuum sealing does nothing to prevent drug sniffing dogs from detecting it. Only something like a mylar bag sealed with an impulse sealer then scrubbed off with isopropyl alcohol is going to make your parcel scent-free.
