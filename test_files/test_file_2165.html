    Ima NOOB here at SR, But by no means a NOOB to shipping substances via USPS..Id like to ad my expertise...I am sure everyone takes precautions by vac sealing etc..
    <br/>
    1- I have found that Turkey roasting/basting  bags are far superior to use for shipping MJ...
    <br/>
    2- USPS can and does use a probe to pierce packages(with no search waarrant} to check contents by whats on probe.The best bet is to conceal your package in a "probe proof" container..Something hard like a metal cookie tin or HARDPLASTIC TUPPERWARE or other NON PIERCEABLE container.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Over 17 yrs using USPS and have NEVER lost a package that wasnt put in a hard no pierceable container..IMAO THIS IS A MUST...Bu do as you please, just offering my advice from decades of using USPS....
    <br/>
    Thx SR and looking forward to my first order this upcoming week...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    much love F00GAZZ1

    I'm sure you understand the cost constraints of implementing such a packaging method?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Packages are coming through completely fine the way they are. Obviously for large orders this is something that can/will be used but for 1 gram of MJ? Nah.

    There is already a vendor that uses a tin for even small orders such as 1g. It actually made me feel really good about the packaging when it took me about an hour to get the tin open. Thing was put on so tight i couldn't get it off with my hands or pliers . So i just beat it with a hammer until it popped open. Now that is what i call probe proof.

    I'll have to contact the vendor first and ask if they are comfortable with me disclosing that information.

    One could always ship in one of the smaller altoid containers, or other similar small mint containers to reduce shipping costs.
