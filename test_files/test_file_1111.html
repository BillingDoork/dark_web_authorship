    Is anyone experiencing delivery delays on their 2-3 priority shipping method from orders that were placed last week?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my case today was the 5th business day and Nada. I hate this shit when it happens. The vendor was nice to reply to my concern to check the status via tracking and told me that there are some delays but was not specific at to why. Order was shipped out on the 8th. My last order using using the vendor came within 2-3 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What bothers me is that I placed another other using another vendor for something else (same 2-3 priority method) on the 10th which was Fri and came to me on Monday...could not believe it - but it was a priority style envelope so it went through a different sorting process I m guessing.

    I'm in the same situation; I placed an order last Tuesday from a highly rated vendor, Priority mail....a week later I haven't received anything. Hopefully it comes today. And yeah, the last thing I ordered about a month ago came in two days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sure it's all okay as my vendor uses amazing stealth but I can't help but be a little paranoid.

    The waiting game is so fucking annoying. I sleep fine as long as I am within 2-3 days but after that 3rd day when in your heart you know you should have received the fucking package is when you start feeling fucking paranoid and fucking anxious and fucking MAD like I am right now

    I am on day 5 after being marked in transit..  That's counting a Sunday as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have spoken with the vendor, and I should see it within 24-48 hours max.  Oddly enough, this delay has kinda been working out to my advantage, but still..  I wanna get high.

    Maybe a bubble hash and tobacco cigarette may help calm the nerves?

    Northeast, here. Same situation. This is business day #5 on a couple of orders. Nothing ever takes this long to get here. It eases my mind a little to know this is apparently a nationwide delay, but... fuck, I was getting worried something had gone Horribly Wrong™.

    Yeah well you all gotta keep demanding for tracking status from the vendor you made the purchase from. My vendor has NOT signed on for 3 days now. So far I sent him 3 PM to follow up and nothing of course. At this point I just want my fucking coins back and will never do business ever again. Unacceptable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There would be hell to pay if he comes back and says 50% refund. WTF should I lose for his/her fucking things up. I know my address/name is correct so fuck him/her if they try to pull a quick on me.

    I had a priority pack from UGS take 7 days total from ordered, 5 business days total shipping.  It showed the day before mother's day but I assume there was a lot more mail that week because of the holiday.  I shipped my mother a card so sorry I was part of the problem  :o

    Yep, another day with nothing. Interestingly I have not received any mail AT ALL since I ordered, usually I'll get some junk mail every day but it's been 8 business days. And my neighbors haven't been getting as much either (I would know because they just throw all the junk mail on the ground around the mailboxes).
    <br/>
    Calm down dude because with several people all having the same issues from different vendors it 99% IS just the USPS being shitty and it'll all work itself out.

    Hopefully it's just relegated to Mother's Day, but don't count on it totally!
    <br/>
    Ever since the end of January when USPS deemed it necessary to make changes in postage, tracking, &amp; more consolidation, there have been slightly longer transit times slowly gaining a head of steam!  We have noticed that in the last 2 months a bit more length in some, not all transit times, &amp; just the last 2 weeks there getting longer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Priority used to be 2-4 days . . now 2-7
    <br/>
    First class used to be 3-5 days . . .  now 4-9
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So while some orders are still getting the same as before transit times, a small percentage are taking 2-3X longer with a few taking 5-6X longer!
