    I'm perplexed as to why anyone would outwardly discuss specifics about stealth methods. You might think it's all fine and dandy now but how smug would you be if customs took their "war on drugs" to the next level? If you as a vendor have developed a very creative method, awesome...keep it to yourself. If you as a consumer have received your presents in the mail and have been bedazzled by the creativity of the vendors methods...keep it to yourself. Do not say or write a single thing about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason I am writing this is because a have read a few posts where members have openly discussed methods that have successfully made it through customs. I am not going to bump those threads by commenting on them and I hope those posts die a quick death.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is a moment that occurs (should occur) in your mind just before you say or write something...."should I go ahead with this statement?".....In this case you should reply back saying quite clearly..."No my fragile LSD/THC/MDMA effected mind, no...please do not say that. I love getting my LSD from O/S sources and you are potentially jeopardizing this."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Governments around the world have spent billions of dollars on the pathetic war on drugs. It would not take much for these governments to step up their attack on SR. The success of SR relies 100% on postal services and the stealth methods used by vendors.

    Don't discuss postage/packaging methods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, it's not hard for anyone to work out. Just order from a few different vendors. That tends to reveal the most common methods fairly easily.

    a lot of people probably want to know if the vendor uses adequate stealth before they spend their money..

    I've actually seen some vendors describe the shipping method in their listings, almost as an advertisement. Where should the line be drawn

    imho i think that saying certain things such as if a particular vendor uses a MBB or if they vac seal for example would be ok as i think that is pretty generic.. i am still pretty new so someone correct me if i am incorrect..

    Ya, it seems like common sense that discussing ways to successfully break the law would be interesting reading for law enforcement. The dilemma is how to communicate whether vendors have good stealth or not. I've seen two feedbacks from the same day, same listing, one saying stealth needs improvement and one saying stealth is awesome. Not helfpul! If buyers describe the stealth method in detail, people can make their own decision as to whether it's awesome or needs improvement, but now we're back to the original point.

    Saying something generic like 'double vacuum sealed then in an mbb, clean package with printed address labels' that isn't really giving away any secrets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Getting into detail like 'the return address was 123 main street, in a manilla padded envelope, with a company logo of JC Sweets Co, powder was well hidden in a DVD c ase' now that would be a little too detailed.

    I think the main thing vendors should worry about (besides vac and MBB seal) is the way the letter/package looks on the outside. You want your letter to blend and if it does get handled manually, you want the person to not think twice about it. I received an OS package yesterday and I was quite amused how the letter looked...Looked extremely professional and looked like a genuine letter...Brilliant. All it takes is for one vendor to do it half assed, like hand written address etc and that drop house is burnt. I would be pissed as hell if my drop had to be burnt because one vendor decided to be lazy or some shit...Majority of vendors do put in the effort from my experience but there is always going to be a few that could not give 2 shits...
