    I'm not sure if shipping methods are allowed to be discussed here but I'm wondering how could one go about shipping a capsule/capsules in a normal envelope.
    <br/>
    In the UK I'd want to be able to send it with one 1st class stamp but I wouldn't want it to be obvious that there's a capsule in it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If for any reason you don't want to post a method publicly could you please PM me as I could really do with this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    The capsules are size 0, not sure if that matters?

     thats going to be a thick letter... wouldnt recommend doing it as there auto-sorters might get caught up with that thickness. If you do end up doing this please test it a bunch of times with legal capsules to ensure the method works.

    How do other vendors on the road go about sending capsules?
    <br/>
    I'm not asking for incriminating shipping methods but a general idea of how they do it.
    <br/>
    I'm thinking of vending a product within capsules but unsure as to how I would ship the product without sending it as a parcel (this would increase shipping costs greatly)

    I ship my capsules as far as australia, so clearly I'm doing something right  ;)
    <br/>

    Basically, padding is key.

    Ok thanks, do you have to pay more for postage. I was only hoping to pay one 1st class stamp for each order I send out but I think padding it would maybe cost more for postage?

    Standard 1st class limits you to 5mm thick - 1st class large letter on the other hand is 90p and allows you to go up to 25mm thick or 100g.

    Order pills from  a few very well known reputable vendors who have a high success rate to countries like AUS/USA/CANADA, and you will see their stealth. Thats better than asking on the forums where ANYONE can read.
