    What are people's thoughts of using Australia Post Parcel Lockers to receive SR items?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A parcel lockers are 24hrs and street-facing. The lockers aren't individually assigned like PO Boxes, they are re-used like luggage storage at the gym is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you receive mail, it's placed in the locker and Auspost sends you SMS/email with a one-off access code to collect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The postal address is the post office itself, and the only identifier factor is the Locker CN.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is the general consensus on SR on their use?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example address:
    <br/>
    Jane Smith
    <br/>
    Parcel Locker CN 12345 67890
    <br/>
    170-172 Chapel Street
    <br/>
    ST KILDA VIC 3182
    <br/>

    This has been discussed. If you look into Falkinknive's thread/s (I think that is how you spell his name) on Australia Post statistics I think there is quiet a discussion on this. I believe most people were against it, as it is very easy for LE to set you up.

    You only have a day to pick up your parcel if it gotfound before then pretty easy for a cop to sit in his car for a day and catch you.
    <br/>
    Plus the have cameras everywhere and your name wouldn't be the smartest thing to do

    It's actually 48hrs, my local Parcel Locker has no cameras, and the lockers are not viewable from the street.

    Bad idea, read the other thread as it's all be discussed already. If you still think it's a good idea after reading that then good luck to you.

    As I have mentioned on the other thread, I have been in communication with vendors on SR and other sites and they have reported that they have sent to AusPost Parcel Lockers without incident.  My sample is small, but if it is representative, then these lockers may not pose a significantly higher risk w.r.t. a P.O. Box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You do not have to show ID to register for these.  Registration works as long as you provide a name and a verifiable residential postal address.  It is trivial to find random residential postal addresses using google (just pick a location that looks residential and verify it using the street view; chances are it will be accepted by the locker rego).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, it looks like these lockers may represent good value, as part of a well-balanced drop portfolio.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have begun to do some experiments mailing things to myself at parcel lockers distributed throughout my city under a fake name.  I will report on whether these experiments are successful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The key sticking point seems to be whether it is practicable to send letters or C5 Express post envelopes.  The lockers are not supposed to be used for these, but I have heard of cases where this has worked.  I will be testing these and will let the forums know what I find.
