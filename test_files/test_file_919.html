    Hey guys, i already tried to search information about that kind of order like i am thinking to give but can not find any information about it, i am somewhere in middle east close to europe, i had couple gram orders in past,(jwh,am) 2-5 but i will never try to give bigger orders than 5 grams, right now i am thinking to give 25 gram Jwh-Xxx but i don't know about customs, i guess 5 gram and under packages seems to never be a problem for borders (Cannabinoid) , but what about 10 or 25?, Our borders as tight but not as Australia or Russia , so if you guys have any experience's or advices let me know about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (note: if 25 is seems too risky to you guys, i can talk with vendor and he can split it to the two packs of 12.5 grams, and send them separate  (btw he is very trustable vendor and knows stealth packaging very well)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best Regards.

    Only thing I can think of is to get the order staggered at 5gm's at a time over a period of two weeks.

    hi click-bang, i'm in south europe and i always buy 20- 30 g of weed, without problems.
    <br/>
    For christmas i personally send in belarus to my friend 12g of weed and she received the package without problems.
    <br/>
    The problem is the time, the package took 20 days to arrive, but it arrived.
    <br/>
    I hope this can help you.
    <br/>
    Cheers.

    Once i was get a opened package,that was a yellow envelope also there was not sealing glue on the cover or around of it. i asked it about to my dealer and they say they will never send a opened package to anywhere but, also there was a undelivery return adress sticker on it and it was not top of the cover it was under the cover (that area needs to be sealed with envelope's own glue line), if it was sealed there will be glue or opened sealing marks on the returning adress sticker but there wasn't,also there wasn't a envelope's own glue line, maybe they will send it already opened, maybe some curious jerk face opened it around the building, than scared and leaved it alone, or maybe customs opened it and flagged to the adress for bust, but if they does that i guess they are smart to close it again and send it without any marking.. but like i said there must be sealing glue marks at under the cover but no where i can find it, and when i open the corner connections of envelope i can see the glue marks clearly. so that envelope's paper leaves mark of sealing glue properly..
    <br/>
    i already change the adress for other orders but i never give any orders to with complete fake name, just giving wrong names to something like the real one ( joshua duhon = ( jonny duhon) if i use a complete different name than mail service may can not send the delivery for the adress because of full fake named people never recorded to that delivery adress,i guess i have to try it with some cheap package with completely fake name.
