    Ordered a small amount, easily fits into standard envelope. First time using SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Got a notification on the tracking (sent via express post with Canada post):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Customer addressing error found; attempting to correct. Possible delay."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I used an altered business name (I know stupid, this was before I read the forums properly). But our house gets tons of mail from previous tenants and various business names (multiple people living here). So I don't think this is an issue. But it certainly doesn't help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think the issue was an incorrect postal code. The package location is in a northern part of where I live that has a very similar postal (one letter variation). I've lived in both parts of the city so I know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So its possible either I sent the incorrect postal code (I used privnote so can't confirm) or the vendor did made a typo.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way I'm still a bit anxious. Waiting to hear back from vendor on what to do next.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice on how to handle this?

    since you didnt use the appropriate name - definitely do not blame the vendor and demand a refund or anything. many just copy/paste the exact message... from what you admit it seems most likely to be your responsibility
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hopefully the address was close enough and they will likely be able to figure out where to deliver it if the address was mostly correct - if its the wrong name though they just might not deliver it and return to sender (no, not to the vendor because he obviously didnt use his return address so it will be lost)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    make sure you learn from it at least

    Right, won't demand a refund from the vendor for sure. I'm fine with losing a package as long as there's no legal repercussions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What exactly happens when a letter gets returned to an incorrect address and gets "lost"? Does it get destroyed by the post office? Is it more likely to get opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    btw, if it was an postal code issue I believe they'll figure it out as it would have been one letter at most incorrect. I had another normal invoice sent with the incorrect postal code earlier in the month and it showed up (this is a recurring problem in my life as I move around constantly for work, so my address is hard to remember).

    i agree, if it was close theyre pretty good at figuring out where to deliver it
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it depends on if they used a true address or made one up
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if it was real, then the person at that location will get the mail most likely and its hard to say whether theyd open it or toss it. id probably open it out of curiosity but dont think any consequences would like follow
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if it is a false address then the post just probably dumps it into the trash with other undeliverable as addressed mail i am guessing - i dont think they can legally open all that mail but i am definitely not sure

    I had an issue with an order and the zip code was had one digit transposed (not sure if that was my bad or vendors, but whatever). Vendor gave me the DCN and it shipped to a city nearby, then shipped to my city, then back again...did that a number of times and then they finally read the damn label and delivered accordingly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That was USPS.  It took a while but they delivered.

    Confirmed it was an incorrect postal code:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I entered something like L0N A2A instead of L2N A2A  (for example)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fortunately there is no corresponding addressing in that area code or elsewhere in the city. So I'm sure Canada Post will figure it out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My anxiety levels are going back to normal :)
