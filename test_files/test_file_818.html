    I have a storm in my area that started this morning and isn't leaving till Friday, I was expecting my package today or tomorrow, but now that we have a storm I'm worried it will get lost and I'll never receive it. It came with a tracking # I'm just waiting on a response from the vendor I ordered from to see where it's at cause they don't give them out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm worried that they aren't going to send mailmen out in this weather :( What do u guys think?

    ;) @ my mainman Flax! - if he says it's "so" it's "SO"!  8) :o

    Yeah, you might just want to delete this thread before it starts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best you can do is not watch any news programmes.  The media people are just using "thought control" on us. This way we go out and buy . . .  - Come on, we all know,..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Milk, bread, batteries. - Somehow I lived 50+ years thinking if I just scrambled down to the local 7-11 for those three staples of the American way, I could make it through anything mother nature was going
    <br/>
    throw at us! - (don't forget candles!) -I'm sure there are similarities to this ritual around the globe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're in the US, I believe it's still the law that "the mail must get through". That's why it's etched in stone at that HUGE post office in NYC near Penn Station, that famous quote.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these courageous couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds" and was said about 2500 years ago by the Greek historian, Herodotus. He said this adage during the war between the Greeks and Persians about 500 B.C. in reference to the Persian mounted postal couriers whom he observed and held in high esteem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're new to SR you're going to go through a whole evolutionary relationship with your mailbox, or slot, or wherever IT comes in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It all goes back to another old saying. "A watched pot will never boil" - meaning if you stand there waiting for it, it's going to seem like a lifetime before it happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm almost a year on here, and I think of it now, as.  20% chance it's already lost, or some postal worker junkie is doin my shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    30% chance the "weather" or something else might delay it. - Then the other 50% is, it's definitely coming !!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So look on the bright side!  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We've all been there my friend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace
