    What country did you import from? Anything bad happen to anyone? Would like to get a personal amount because it's about half the price of what's available domestically.

    Young man, please don't tell me that you actually expect people to give you their sources. Because if you do, you are being semi-retarded.

    He's asking if importing MDMA from, say, the EU (supertrips, afterhour, etc.) is safe. That's it. Don't know how you misconstrued what he said as "Hey bitches I want your sources" but idk maybe you're smoking too much crack.  ::)

    LOL. A lot of people order from oversees with no issue. ST, AH, AQ, and several others are trusted vendors. It's your call.. but the Aidoneus team is here to serve if you decide to go domestic  8)
    <br/>
    Lightning shipping, excellent packaging, quality product.

    No problem on the plug. Yeah, I'm not asking about sources, just trying to see what the success rate is like. I know MDMA is one of the easiest things for drug dogs and scanners to detect.

    The three vendors I mentioned have all had solid success. AH just recently changed his packaging and it's supposed to be pretty good. CristalClear is another supposedly good (albeit new) vendor whose packaging is apparently solid. Take your pick.
