    Just wondering what the chances of a uk domestic letter/jiffy bag getting intercepted is containing mephedrone/mdma/alprazolam I order quite a bit of mephedrone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was also thinking of ordering some mdma from the Netherlands since it's cheaper and i've seen it for as little as 14 pounds a gram, what would the chances of say 3 grams being intercepted be and does the weight matter (what i mean is would 3 grams have the same chance of getting intercepted as 10 or 20 grams?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also would sniffer dogs be able to detect lsd/2cb/benzos/cathinones I know they probably could if they where trained to but are the commanly trained to smell out these substances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice or comments welcome

    Found this on a wikpedia page for bath salts "cannot be smelled by detection dogs" I'm not sure why this is or how reliable it is but it's a start.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anybody tell me the risk of getting caught uk domestic, I will try to find some more information about detection dogs.

    odds are low

    benzos/

    i think odds are high

    cathinone

    never heard of that.

    well buddy, do what you want to, but for a couple of pounds... id go domestic. surveillance in britain is so absurd. orders coming from the NL are very likely to be checked and scanned for ever. Can even bite you in the a$$ later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    dont risk it. unless your drop is really good.

    Thanks for the reply, most stuff I order will be for resale the mdma is for a friend and I think staying domestic would be best i'll just say if he wants it he'll need to pay more or i'll wait until another vendore restocks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The low odds on 2cb and lsd sounds good since it looks like there could be good money in that if i find the right group of people, shame about the benzos being high was planning on buying some alprazolam powder and filling my own gell caps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By cathinones i mean mephedrone/4-mmc but the stuff on the road is definitelly not that and most likely some other cathinone

    acid is also pretty cheap iÂ  the states. might even be safer than ordering from NL. do some research.
