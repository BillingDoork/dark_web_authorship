    Ok guys, nothing bad happened here so don't get the wrong idea. I just have a question....
    <br/>
    If they were to pull a CD on me how the fuck would they do it... Lemme give you the run down on my special situation... I have made a thread similar before but would like to increase my knowledge...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Business Residence with a PO box type system, even for bigger packages there is a special bigger box!
    <br/>
    The PO box system is for a decent number of homes.
    <br/>
    I have never had to sign for 1 single thing, everything is put right in my box to which only I have a key.
    <br/>
    Other people receive mail to this box, quite a bit.
    <br/>
    Ritzy Neighborhood
    <br/>
    I know the mailman, he is of a distinguishing race, we have actually exchanged words and I let him know I am a eBay addict....
    <br/>
    I know his route and EXACT delievery time....
    <br/>
    HE NEVER COMES TO MY HOUSE FOR ANYTHING, I have never seen his truck make it around our hood, he always stops at the boxes at the entrance!
    <br/>
    You can't access my hood without permission so sketchy cars will be noticed.
    <br/>
    House is kept clean other than personal bud &amp; 1 piece
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously it sounds like a good situation in retrospect. However, can someone tell me how they would do a CD on me. I am going to straight DENY if they ever try to get me to sign but I live with other people so I am scared they might unknowingly sign for me. Then Im shit. I always bring my packs straight home, open, store safely, dispose of trash safely.. Can they bust you even if you don't sign? Has anyone heard of how they might do this because they would use this on me for sure!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is just my personal buds, concentrates, some shroomz, edibles house. Nothing serious here. Just wanting to stay safe.
    <br/>
    I use another clean home hours away for my bulks &amp; weight!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lemme know what you think guys!
    <br/>

    Well I ain't no expert but here goes:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There was a thread (either in Security forum or this one) about a case involving a package of heroin that got intercepted enroute. Then the cops just stuffed a GPS tracker in it and let the delivery happen like normal. After a little while when the transmitter told them the package inside the guy's house they got a warrant and raided him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, maybe a good way to avoid that would be to have some kind of a hand-held scanner that could detect an electronic transmitter and use it to scan the package before removing it from the PO box. If the scanner alerts you, then you know it's got some sort of electronic device inside it.

    Thanks for the fast responses guys! Ill check out what I can find. But I mean the package is going to be in my house eventually and I will need to use the drugs... So wouldn't I just be better off ripping it right open so I can flush everything if I find a tracker? Im saying I plan fully on bringing it back to my house and opening it right up... But I see what your saying if I had the scanner I could tell right then, and be foolproof.

    ACTUALLY! Just had a bomb ass fucking idea. Why not set up a camera at my entrance so I can see exactly what cars come in, also set up 1 in my mail room set for a certain hour range so I can monitor what mailman it is leaving my package. The actual one or LE
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Correct me if Im wrong but if LE discovers my package, they can't let my ACTUAL mailman deliver it can they? That would be like them giving drugs to a citizen. So every day before I go to get my package. I can check my little tape, make sure its the same black dude. &amp; go grab that shit right!?

    They can and have, as I've read.  See the problem is that they're going to have thought of all this too... this is their job.  They get paid to catch you, and while their morals are shit, not all of them are stupid.  So you're up against someone who's had lots of time to think about this and enough experience to perfect their technique.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A camera seems like it would draw more attention than it's worth... but I don't know, you know the setup and I don't, so maybe not.

    There will be days when your regular mail carrier will not be delivering your mail (sick days, vacation, etc) so you can't always count on that having that angle covered.  Also, carrier routes get reassigned at regular intervals so eventually you'll get a new regular mailman/woman.

    There is a cheaper solution to solving the problem of a gps device inside a package. Mind you, it will require some foil paper or some kind of container/bag lined with a conductive material.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can exploit a strange property of physics in which the electric field within an enclosed conducting shell always equals zero. WHen the shell experiences an external electric field, this causes the charges within the shell (foil paper) to distribute in such a way as to always cancel any electric field on the inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Test it out, turn on your gps on your cellphone and track it with your computer or another smartphone. Now wrap it in foil paper and see what happens. I haven't tested it but I'm pretty sure that your phone will lose all signal and appear to have disappeared from existance. You shouldn't even be able to call it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Haha, if you wanted to be adventurous, throw your phone in the microwave all wrapped in foil and turn it on for a bit. You'll probably see a bunch of crazy sparks, but the net electric field inside the foil paper should still remain zero and your phone should be safe. Think airplanes and lightning storms. The sparks are from excess charge building up on the surface of the foil paper.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This phenomenon is called a Faraday cage or Faraday shield.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Criminals often use this technique to bypass the security strips on merchandise at stores.

    The issue is once the signal disappears they'll come bursting in with the warrant.  Also, DON'T order to an address where there are drugs already, come on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thirdly, I've read that LE is implementing technology such as this for large or important orders/discoveries, but more simple and better implemented.  It's a device that sends out NO signal till the package is opened, then it signals the package has been opened and in come the police with a quickness.  Good luck opening a package in a Faraday box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think your setup would be ideal if you didn't already have drugs on-site.

    If your ever in fear that something isnt right about a pack revieved, like i have been once or twice before, simply do not open the letter or package for like 24 hours. Its safe to say that if your to be raided or busted, it will happen long before 24 hours, but its a safe number.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everytime ive done this, its of coarse was just my paranoia. From what ive heard postal inspectors and LE alike, tell me, if there is to be a bust, it happens asap. God speed.

    Faraday closet would be easy enough to make. You don't need tinfoil, only a conductive mesh - only signals with a wavelength shorter than the holes will make it through, meaning a fairly fine brass mesh would work. Line a closet, and the closet door with this, making sure any gaps are sufficiently small, and you have your own little closet of electronic invisibility. Of course, tinfoil would work just as well, though it may be trickier to be sure you have no gaps / avoid ripping it / the shiniest closet ever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My physics aren't perfect, and I simplified some of the attributes - but it will work. Mythbusters made such a cage with brass screen and showed it to block cell signal.

    you are still legally responsible and in acceptance of the package whether or not you physically sign it, as I am sure you are aware.

    you're well on your way to having a very good drop. There are a few things you will want to tweak imo.
