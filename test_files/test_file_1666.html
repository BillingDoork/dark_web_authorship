    Greetings.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have found some websites, www.myus.com, www.shipto.com, &amp; www.viaaddress.com.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But i have readed all kind of bad reviews about those websites, and some good ones to also, but i dont trust them enough to ship my package throw them, so my question is, does anyone here know anything about those websites, or have experience with another website? - if so please link.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as always +1 karma to those nice people out there.  ;D

    That's quite funny they still shipped you your pills after discovering what they were. All these on forwarding mail services open the package they receive before repackaging it. I have used one such site for legit purchases and it is clear everything is carefully screened before they take over the next shipping leg, as such they are not worth considering.

    No offense meant but that is completely FALSE information. Sure, I bet any mail forwarding place you find on google may do some screening processes, but one of the biggest online pharmacy on the clearnet, which I am sure many people have heard of. *hint* it is based out of the Philippines and the owner answers every email with the name "Jim" signed on the bottom. I am sure tons of people on here know which website I am talking about as they have very top quality benzo's and other medication for dirt cheap prices. I used them years ago when I used to order benzo's just for personal use but they are still active and have been for over 20 years but ANYWAY...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This certain online pharmacy refused to ship to certain states as they were only having customs issues with certain states as their stealth is so good. SO, if you lived in one of these tough custom states, he MADE you use a mail forwarding service that he provided the link/info too and he had a list of quite a few that he knew always worked and did not open the package. Their websites even state that since they are actually not a totally licensed mail forwarding service, they legally were not even allowed to open any mail they were forwarding but what they were doing is not illegal. They are basically just doing people favors by forwarding their mail to them for a $10 or $15 fee and no license is required to do that....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I know for a fact that there are plenty honest, independent mail forwarding companies that do NOT open anything they receive. I believe the only forward mail through the USA (that's where they are based obviously) but I could be wrong, I am sure some will forward it anywhere if you pay extra.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From the information I provided, it will not be hard for any of you to figure out which clearnet online pharmacy I am talking about. They no longer have a website but just operate as an email vendor service but there are some VERY big clearnet message boards all about clearnet online pharmacies and since this one has been around for so long, sells high quality European meds (but ship from the Philippines), has very good stealth and rock bottom prices...It is talked about ALL the time on the clearnet message boards and I am sure if you did some digging you could easily find out the mail forwarding services or find out which states he doesn't ship too, find his email and message pretending you need to place an order to the banned state and he will provide the info. I would email him and ask for you guys but he won't supply that info to me as he knows I live in Canada and the only way he would provide it is if you are placing an order as he does not want word to spread all over about any of the people he uses as he said it took him years to find the right people that he can trust....But as I said, the information can literally be found on google with a tiny bit of digging.

    I dont really see the point of using this kind of service.  If the enemy we're trying to avoid is the postal inspector/cops, how would having a package go through the mail system twice help at all?  If anything its more time in transit for smells to leak out of packaging.  And you still have to use your real name and credit card when signing up for the service, and then receive it when it's reshipped to you.

    Is it just to keep your real address out of the vendors' hands and off their computer?  Are you a famous person or something?

    Well I've been using a private mail forwarding company in Australia atm they don't open mail or need proof of id
    <br/>
    All they ask for is a email address / mobile number to contact you only when your package is recieved!
    <br/>
    It's awesome no more sending my home address to vendors in other country's and if it's seized customs don't have my address or name either. I can wait 2 extra days to get my parcel with almost no risk of being caught
    <br/>
    It's a win win for me!

    practical experience in shipping to: might as well be 0 cuz whats the difference?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But some thoughts.
    <br/>
    1) if your remailer was set up correctly it could function as a safety for buyers.
    <br/>
    by this I mean if it was an off shore company and the various local branches had no access to account information. This would in turn mean that they could not give out customer information to any LE. Now this is by no means fool proof. But this does prevent a mass grab of information by LE showing up to a remailer. If worked properly it could also act as a buffer providing a warning system to remailer clients.
    <br/>
    Allow me to illustrate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    remailer A is set up in some off shore country. This is merely a data storage head office. When someone wishes to open account with the company they walk into the local office (just like fedex) and provide the needed info which is pretty much only an address they wish their packages sent to. Nothing else is required. They in turn are issues an account number. realistically this is a name. so when your package is sent to you the remailers local office it is sent to:
    <br/>
    John Smith
    <br/>
    123 fake street
    <br/>
    fakeville, FAKE
    <br/>
    Fake
    <br/>
    12345
    <br/>
    <br/>
    John smith is the account "number" and corresponds to information that is not held on any local computer but is held in an off shore location (the main branch office) So there you go. you now have a safe middle man address. one more level of protection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So now the actual working machine. A package arrives for John smith to the company all legit. the company has it's client agreement to not open packages. fair enough. So they simply remove the labels and place it into a new box, and mail head office for a label for john smith. head office sends back the address (still can be a safe drop address, in fact it should be.) and the label is printed and the box is sent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So is it 100% fool proof and safe, NO!!!!! can LE still follow the package? yes, though it might be harder. But they can come in and get the address. Well they can sort of get the address. LE can't simply walk in and get the address on the spot. Why because it requires an email being sent to some off shore place. The steps involved lend time to the person receiving.
    <br/>
    There can also be other built in safeties. Such as a distress coding or distress email. This is a very simple process that bank tellers use for opening a safe. if they are in distress they punch in a separate code that opens the safe like normal but sends a signal to the police. So in this case you could have 2 email accounts set up. if all things are normal then you request info from email acct 1. if you are for any reason being requested to provide this information then you use email acct 2. Or it can be something as simple as wording in the msg, or some other simple system. putting a 1 at the bottom of the email if all is good, putting a 9 if it's not. it doesn't really matter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    alright so Billy is having stuff sent to him through this remailer. alright no problem it's been working fine the remailer has multiple store fronts allowing for packages to arrive from different points. Wicked cool. If anything ever goes wrong an alert is sent to Billy so billy can prepare for what may or may not happen. remember the remailer is a legal company and in no way can be compliant with doing illegal things. But having an agreement to alert an account holder isn't illegal. Nor is it illegal to not open and rebox a package to send along. But the remailer must send that package to the account holders PROVIDED address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as a sender it could help save costs on shipping, and may even allow for some recovery of packages in a weird way. but thats all thinking outside of the box and isn't relevant at this point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MakingMoneyy is talking about parcel pick up which can also be an option. He waits for an email/call that his parcel has arrived and then he/she goes and picks up the package from the office (sorta like picking up at a PO box) I assume. This does exactly as he said, it allows him to not give out any information and leaves him mostly worry free. Now I bet every time he picks up a package his starfish is puckered so tight that you couldn't slip a needle past. Because thats the downside. That customs says "screw this we want whos getting this not just to stop the package." if it's a personal amount maybe they wouldn't give a shit. if it's more then perhaps it gets turned over for investigation. Then the package gets sent to the service, the service calls you and the cops wait and watch. Grab you on the way out. OR they don't even wait, they just show up there and get all your info from the office and then start investigating you.
    <br/>
    It is a buffer, but in some ways it leaves a false sense of safety.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unfortunately for the OP none of the current services offer what I'm talking about. Hell it might not even be legal. who knows. But all of the current remailer services that are out there right now seem (to me at least) to offer at best a small positive (not giving your real address to a vendor) but could offer a very big false sense of security and there is nothing stopping these remailers opening your package, and/or contacting the authorities or working with the authorities if they show up asking questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Side note
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the service I first talked about, the one that doesn't exist. what would it be worth? I know currently the service charge something like 5 bucks a package and they don't offer any sense of safety. That seems steep to me.

    something else I never considered, the receiver as well as the sender can both have a confirmation of receiving at the midpoint (local remailer office)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the package arrives standard regular mail and the remailer would shoot an email to off shore head office for arrival confirmation and address to send to, for the account John Smith. head office sends the listed address back to local remailer, and then sends out an email to "john smith" stating that the package was received on this date and this time and will be put out for shipping on this date.
    <br/>
    I'm not 100% sure how it would work for informing the vendor as well, probably something the vendor would have to have an account with the remailer as well. so the return address would go to the head office and if it matched up to an email address then bam an email is sent to that account holder stating "package to john smith arrived this date and will be sent this date"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This could help with the escrow here. without package tracking it is proof that something was sent and arrived at least at the half way point (or if multiple remailers are used then at that point) the person on the other end would also have a third party stating that a package had arrived so they aren't sitting in limbo wondering so much.
    <br/>
    if the package is undeliverable it also has a return address to go back to. all be it the remailer but that's something.

     <br/>
     <br/>
     remailer A is set up in some off shore country. This is merely a data storage head office. When someone wishes to open account with the company they walk into the local office (just like fedex) and provide the needed info which is pretty much only an address they wish their packages sent to. Nothing else is required. They in turn are issues an account number. realistically this is a name. so when your package is sent to you the remailers local office it is sent to:
     <br/>
     John Smith
     <br/>
     123 fake street
     <br/>
     fakeville, FAKE
     <br/>
     Fake
     <br/>
     12345
     <br/>
     <br/>
     John smith is the account "number" and corresponds to information that is not held on any local computer but is held in an off shore location (the main branch office) So there you go. you now have a safe middle man address. one more level of protection.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So now the actual working machine. A package arrives for John smith to the company all legit. the company has it's client agreement to not open packages. fair enough. So they simply remove the labels and place it into a new box, and mail head office for a label for john smith. head office sends back the address (still can be a safe drop address, in fact it should be.) and the label is printed and the box is sent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So is it 100% fool proof and safe, NO!!!!! can LE still follow the package? yes, though it might be harder. But they can come in and get the address. Well they can sort of get the address. LE can't simply walk in and get the address on the spot. Why because it requires an email being sent to some off shore place. The steps involved lend time to the person receiving.
     <br/>
     There can also be other built in safeties. Such as a distress coding or distress email. This is a very simple process that bank tellers use for opening a safe. if they are in distress they punch in a separate code that opens the safe like normal but sends a signal to the police. So in this case you could have 2 email accounts set up. if all things are normal then you request info from email acct 1. if you are for any reason being requested to provide this information then you use email acct 2. Or it can be something as simple as wording in the msg, or some other simple system. putting a 1 at the bottom of the email if all is good, putting a 9 if it's not. it doesn't really matter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     alright so Billy is having stuff sent to him through this remailer. alright no problem it's been working fine the remailer has multiple store fronts allowing for packages to arrive from different points. Wicked cool. If anything ever goes wrong an alert is sent to Billy so billy can prepare for what may or may not happen. remember the remailer is a legal company and in no way can be compliant with doing illegal things. But having an agreement to alert an account holder isn't illegal. Nor is it illegal to not open and rebox a package to send along. But the remailer must send that package to the account holders PROVIDED address.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     as a sender it could help save costs on shipping, and may even allow for some recovery of packages in a weird way. but thats all thinking outside of the box and isn't relevant at this point.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MakingMoneyy is talking about parcel pick up which can also be an option. He waits for an email/call that his parcel has arrived and then he/she goes and picks up the package from the office (sorta like picking up at a PO box) I assume. This does exactly as he said, it allows him to not give out any information and leaves him mostly worry free. Now I bet every time he picks up a package his starfish is puckered so tight that you couldn't slip a needle past. Because thats the downside. That customs says "screw this we want whos getting this not just to stop the package." if it's a personal amount maybe they wouldn't give a shit. if it's more then perhaps it gets turned over for investigation. Then the package gets sent to the service, the service calls you and the cops wait and watch. Grab you on the way out. OR they don't even wait, they just show up there and get all your info from the office and then start investigating you.
     <br/>
     It is a buffer, but in some ways it leaves a false sense of safety.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unfortunately for the OP none of the current services offer what I'm talking about. Hell it might not even be legal. who knows. But all of the current remailer services that are out there right now seem (to me at least) to offer at best a small positive (not giving your real address to a vendor) but could offer a very big false sense of security and there is nothing stopping these remailers opening your package, and/or contacting the authorities or working with the authorities if they show up asking questions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Side note
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For the service I first talked about, the one that doesn't exist. what would it be worth? I know currently the service charge something like 5 bucks a package and they don't offer any sense of safety. That seems steep to me.

    Yes you practically have it right except the fact i dont have to leave or go pick it up
    <br/>
    from the office
    <br/>
    its a little like your first point
    <br/>
    they only have my email address,
    <br/>
    once the package arrives im emailed and asked what i would like done.
    <br/>
    At this point i have the package sent anywhere in the country i want my house, friends house, neighbours, drop etc etc.
    <br/>
    or kept there and bundled with other mail for sending at a later date.
    <br/>
    it makes me feel a little safer knowing that i control the shots so if it gets intercepted the cops cant really come to me as i can be anywhere im just a random name/email address according to the company.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but i do like your escrow idea thats what i would like at least you would know where along the line it goes missing and not have to worry about if the vendor even sent the item
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it would also be safer for both vendor and buyer as if the vendor send a couple packages and if none make it to the 3rd party they can take proper precautions that maybe LE are profiling them and give them a chance to change it up/go into hiding etc.

    This thread had some interesting points though which is some Mail Forwarders will spend considerably less time inspecting Packages than others, and who knows how it would work with Virtual Office Providers. I will post some results later through Trial and Error when I get going with using them with Oneiros Distribution. :)

    I was wondering how this could work (legally) for a vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so established that the receiver (lets say billy) has an acct, and that account name is john smith. so as stated before a package arrives to the remailers address with the name john smith on it. so the local receiving office sends a mail to head office. "package to john smith arrived *date* awaiting instructions 1" (the 1 refers to no one questioning about the package, 9 would refer to someone asking about it)
    <br/>
    Head office sees the email and looks up john smith in their computer and the instructions are
    <br/>
    "do not open, rebox/label. send to *whatever billy gave as his actual address for mail to be sent to from the remailer*"
    <br/>
    special note: "please email peterbillybob@whatever with notification of receiving date and sending date of package. Also email if personal information requested by persons regarding package"
    <br/>
    So head office sends back to local office only "whatever billy gave as his actual address for mail to be sent to"
    <br/>
    Head office then sends an email to "peterbillybob" giving notice that the package was received on date, and will be sent out on date.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (you know the remailer could even use a tracking number because what the hell does a remailer care whats in the package. if LE comes knocking it's a legit business and this is what the client paid for. express tracked mail)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if you were a vendor you could also have an acct. no information needed (just like any other acct.) but now you are given a name and perhaps a warehouse address that belongs to the company. So the warehouse, package sorting/storage area is:
    <br/>
    987 fake st
    <br/>
    fakeville, FA
    <br/>
    FAK
    <br/>
    12345
    <br/>
    So the vendor (or any sender) uses his account number (say a vendor creates an acct with the name Tim Wong)
    <br/>
    so local office receives a package for john smith and follows the process above. however they note that the package is sent from their own warehouse
    <br/>
    "Tim Wong
    <br/>
    987 fake st
    <br/>
    fakeville, FA
    <br/>
    FAK
    <br/>
    12345"
    <br/>
    So in a second email they send a msg to head office. "package received from Tim Wong for john smith"
    <br/>
    Head office does everything as stated above regarding sending the package on. They also look up acct Tim Wong.
    <br/>
    Tim Wong: "please notify *fake email that actually works for tim wong* when packages are received from tim wong. if express shipping is used please note tracking number and retain for 1 month."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So head office (without any knowledge from the local office) sends an email to Tim wong stating "package for john smith received on DATE. The package will be sent on DATE. There is (or isn't) tracking on this package. Tracking will only be given at request and will be held for 1 month"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know it sounds like a lot of work. but... it actually isn't. i mean its like 2 none retards working at separate offices. packages come in and there you go. the name on each package is sent to the home office and then the local office sits and waits for instructions. the only shit part is at some point an email will return from head office to the local stating something like "john smith - billy, 345 somereal address" Of course after the label is made the expectation is that the email is deleted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This could also work for pick up, or as makingmoney suggested, the instructions from head office could be "email peterbillybob@ and await current instructions regarding package" or it could be "hold for pickup from billy" or whatever else.
    <br/>
    there are a lot of options here. for both vendor and buyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The question remains. what is it worth?
