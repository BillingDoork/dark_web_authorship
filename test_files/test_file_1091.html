    Has anyone experienced mail being delivered twice in one day?  Does anyone know why this would happen?  I really doubt it has to do with LE because the first time this happened to me was a year ago and the second and last time was 6 months ago.  I know for a fact this happened because I checked the mail and brought all the letters inside.  The first time it happened, the order was in my mailbox 2 hours later and the second time it happened the delay was 6+ hours.  Both were small quantities.  I ask this because one of my packages is taking slightly longer than usual so I'm just hoping it comes in later in the day.

    Was the order express?  Express orders are delivered by a different truck in some locations.

    I think you guys may be misunderstanding my question, so I'll make it as clear as I can possibly make it.  I normally receive all of my letters and SR orders in the same load.  On 2 separate occasions I have received only letters first, then upon checking again hours later the USPS Priority package is in my box.  I do not use SR for express orders and I never receive any express mail or packages otherwise.

    Yes , I understand and that is totally normal.  I have often gotten my regular mail letters first; lets say at noon .  then at 2:30-pm , another mail truck will stop by and put my express or priority letter in the box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It has also happens the other way around , where my express or priority letter is delivered first , at say 10:30am . Then later on , my regular mail man comes with the regular mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And a good portion of the time  , my express or priority mail will come at the same time as my regular mail, brought by the normal mail man along his route.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I imagine there are alot of random factors that determine which will happen and why.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For instance , I get all those different delivery patterns when I'm getting something sent to an address in the city  . But in a small town , there is only a couple of mail men for the whole town, and if the express or priority doesn't make it in time to be put on the truck for the regular mail route . It will just come the next day vs. another express truck coming out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So yeah , it's nothing to be worried about at all.

    I've had larger boxes that don't fit in the mailbox come slightly later than the rest of my mail, but it's only happened a couple of times and it's been within a few minutes.  Like within the amount of time it takes me to mow my rather small front yard.

    Sometimes they drop off packages(boxes/big envelopes/bubble mailers) separately from the regular letter mail.  There were a few times I was bummed out that my packages didn't come only to find out they came like an hour later.

    NateRiver - It happens from time to time. So there's always that 'outside chance' that the the disappointment you felt when your regular delivery came and went w/o 'the goods',  will be made up for by that one odd day, where they have your expected order on the later truck. A family member was a lifer at the USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, as said before, 'many variables' go into the decision to send out certain parcels on "the late truck". - Could be the transfer station that your zip code's packages are sorted through, didn't get the delivery from the next nearest major hub, until after the other truck left, that takes your areas packages to your local PO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then again it could be some sort of Holiday. Maybe one you never considered? Maybe Mothers Day?- -So many scenarios. I think I don't have to list more.
    <br/>
    It's been happening that way for a while, you just never took notice. Most of us suddenly become 'hyper-aware' of the USPS's delivery habits, when we take that giant entrance ramp onto The Silk Road!  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Suffice it to say. You're going to see all sorts of delivery methods, now that you're 'tuned in' to the whole process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last summer I started to really become a regular buyer on here, and was either pissed that the "late truck" stopped coming, or paranoid that "Hey, they never come at 5 O'clock" ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hasn't happened since then, but from what I've learned, it happens more in the summer for whatever reason. Also the ever slowing economy has caused cutbacks. Even Saturday delivery will end in the US in August of this year. They say Priority, Express, and even parcel post packages will still be delivered "in some areas", but regular mail, and office hours on Saturday, will end.  :-\

    It definitely happens, and should certainly not be a cause for concern in and of itself.
