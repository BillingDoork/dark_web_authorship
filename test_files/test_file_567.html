    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering what would be a good method to ship ghb or gbl within the EU? There are strict rules about shipping liquids I heard?
    <br/>
    Would lpde be enough, or does it have to be hpde for the gbl? Normal ghb vials? What kind of plastic are those?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once received ghb in a PP bottle. Not sure if that was really good since it might loosen up unhealthy materials from the bottle itself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will let Virmo do all the shipping. 99,99*% pure gbl. Not just made up to sound cool. Actually really lab true (with certificates). Basf. Though basf doesn't always matter regarding purity.
    <br/>

    First of all GBL should be transported in HDPE containers, never, NEVER in LPDE or others.GBL is highly corrosive and can very easy melt down PET or other materials. Glass is OK, but of course nobody will send you GBL in glass container.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    GHB is no corrosive so it can be transported in whatever you want.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have received GBL from many placer in Europe and there was no problem at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any problems and questions - ask. I have been using GBL/GHB since 1998.

    PP is not good for GHB. Although this depends on the synthesis of the GHB.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The ghb vials are probably ldpe because they are hard and non transparent. Not 100% sure though. But I think so, because hpde is usually soft...(correct me if I'm wrong).
    <br/>

    GHB is almost non-corrosive. Of course it is depend on the synthesis. If it's crap, it will contains GBL. When I do my GHB from GBL it always has PH 7-8 and no GBL odor. So it is quite good quality. And I am not using any chemical equipment...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No, HDPE is not always soft, nontransparent - true, but sometimes is hard.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regarding your question. I think LPDE. HDPE is quite rare, although milk containers are made from it. Did you consider buying GHB in powder?

    Hmm.. I've read on multiple sites that hdpe is soft. And in my experience that is correct.
    <br/>
    All gbl bottles are quite soft. And hdpe is not really rare. At least not here. Almost all cleaning products are in hdpe bottles out here. Ammonia for example, even demineralized water.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm trying out if anything happens with the ghb tubes/flasks/whatever. Until now, nothing has happened. Been 3 days.
    <br/>
    Although I do remember seeing something white-ish on the bottom in the past. Not sure what that could be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could you pm me your recipe, or put it on here?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To answer your question about the powder. No I haven't. Though I think I should, since I'm planning on making it myself with ethanol.
    <br/>
    I wonder why everybody is so secretive about their recipes.
    <br/>
    And I would really like to hear about how bluegiraffe makes his powder. There is some really nice ethanol out here, without poisonous stuff. But that's not what he's using.

    I don't know who you are or where you live, but for a lot of people it is impossible to obtain gbl. Don't forget we also need to ship and let it go through customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We compared other gbl vendors. Our prices are those of Jennifers with her 20% temporary discount. And most just put 99,99% in their texts. They have no idea what it actually is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We also recently learned that if you play small fish on SR, then you are not suited for SR. Which means you have to ask 2-100x more than it's worth to be a big fish. Then you are welcome on SR.
    <br/>
    We can not buy 100ml for 20 euros. Or well, we can, but then that would be at a company where when you ask questions about how come they say it's 99,99% you go onto a blacklist or simply ignored.
    <br/>
    Real pure gbl is almost impossible to get nowadays (out here at least). Unless you just believe what they tell you. We can also add some salts and heavy metals and make it less pure, or just mix it with water, then sell it to you for 15 euro
    <br/>
    s a 100ml. Would you prefer that?

    You posted about what postage methods to use in the EU.. I have had 1 litre of GBL delivered 4 or 5 times from Germany to the UK. Every order was sent 48hr express, from DHL I think.
    <br/>
    One of the orders didn't make it through, and a love letter was sent. Used the same address again for reship, no problems.
    <br/>
    I don't think that UK were / are too bothered about GBL because of the uncertainty in the law regarding its usage. I dont know if that extends to the EU though.
    <br/>
    Also, I remember the love letter coming from customs, and not from LE...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean for the equivalent to 1L of GBL would surely be 1 KG of another product, and i'm sure that 1KG of another class C would bring more attention than  a customs letter.

    It is soft but not always. As I said, never use anything apart glass and HDPE, you won't notice but PET will slowly melt down.

    You mean GBL&gt;GHB recipe? It is simple.

    1 Girl, this is amazing. Her mother made a big fuss. This was a medicine student (Darwin award should she have after her death) necause she mixed GBL with vodka which might be lethal. Thank you moron girl, really thank you. :(

    <br/>
    One supplier send it in one bottle (HDPE) but you must fill in some document. I always put "to clean my alloys" ;)

    Now they stopped orders for a while but they will be back soon.

    Kind of like how magic mushrooms became illegal here. Some french girl with problems already thought she could fly and jumped out of a window.
    <br/>
    I wonder if it actually really happened or was just made up by the government.
    <br/>
    Now magic mushrooms are illegal, but truffels are not (philosophers stones). Which are basically magic mushrooms :p
    <br/>

    Those two recipes are quite different. The amount of NaOH is not the same (or is 130g naoh on 400 TAP water the same as 140g NaOH on distilled water?).

    What is the actual difference between the 2 types of water regarding synthesis of ghb and the "expiration" date?

    Tap water already contains some salts ofcourse and goes bad pretty quick if you put it in a normal bottle outside of the fridge. Whereas distilled water stays ok for a much longer time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The "half a cup" is quite subjective isn't it? I think that is 120ml?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have now tried to boil a mixture in a water boiler. Water boils at 100c. Ghb also boils in it. While NaOH has a boiling point of way over 100c (more like 1000+), gbl about 200 if I remember correctly.
    <br/>
    Turned out more yellow-ish. So I guess it's not a very good method :p

     Sodium GHB
     <br/>
     Procedure:
     <br/>
     Dissolve 130 grams (3.25 moles) of pure sodium hydroxide in 400ml of tap water in a 1000ml glass container while stirring with a glass rod or similar. The dissolution is exothermic, and the solution will heat up. When everything has dissolved to form a clear solution, slowly add 250ml (280 g, 3.25 moles) of gamma-butyrolactone in 50 ml portions with good stirring. The addition of gamma-butyrolactone to the sodium hydroxide solution is also exothermic, and if it is added too fast the solution will begin to boil, and we don't want that. Keep track of the temperature with an immersed thermometer. The addition of the gamma-butyrolactone will take somewhere between 20-30 minutes. When everything has been added, let the mixture react for an additional 10 minutes with occasional stirring.
     <br/>
     Now it is time to see if the reaction has gone to completion by checking the pH with universal pH paper. We are aiming for a pH of 7-8. If it is too high (pH &gt; 8), then add 10 ml of gamma-butyrolactone and let react for a few minutes more. If the pH is too low (pH &lt; 7), add a few ml of concentrated NaOH solution. Continue like this until the pH level is within the desired limits.
     <br/>
     The solution is perfectly clear and tastes slightly salty. It may be slightly yellow colored, but not much if pure enough butyrolactone was used (distillation of the lactone before use takes care of this problem). If an acid is used to neutralize a too basic a solution (instead of adding more lactone), crystals of the sodium salt of the acid can precipitate in the solution, and the taste is severely impaired. The final solution will be around 750 mL 50% NaGHB. The solution can be concentrated (by boiling off excess water) to ~600mL without it crystallizing at room temp, but if concentrating as far as to ~500 mL it will invariably solidify.

    Did you heat both water+NaOH solution and GBL?
    <br/>
    Did it made rapid reaction when you put NaOH solution to  GBL?
    <br/>
    Did you put NaOH solution in parts? Let say  5 times, and stir?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wit your  solution. Put some acid solution in it, for example apple vinegar or citric acid from the food store. And stir, always check PH every time you put acid.

    Guess you did something wrong?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can't remember the amounts of each substance, you'll have to take them from another recipe, but it is important you check pH at each stage. We used a large pyrex casserole dish on a gas burner (need gas for temp control) also a meat temperature probe (up to 200C) and a pyrex measuring jug.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Add 125 ml GBL and 50ml of water to the dish. In the jug mix 150ml water with 60mg NaOH (carefully and slowly, add to water not other way round, it will heat up. This is the bit I can't remember amount but it doesn't matter as we will add it slowly bit by bit to solution later. Find proper amount from online recipe).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Heat GBL/water to over 100C you should get it to 110C as GBL raises boiling point. But it will start to evaporate and you will lose product so hurry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While maintaining temp, pour slowly and carefully NaOH solution, it will fizz violently. Keep checking pH, add a bit more, check. Its advisable to keep a little GBL to balance it if you go over. pH should be 7-8.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once proper pH is achieved, put lid on dish, with temp probe in solution, increase heat until 150C, to boil off water and fully react. At 150C you have molten NaGHB.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pour onto plate or other flat surface, a sheet of clean glass or mirror could work. It will set and cool like candle wax (don't expect crystals). Scrape into container and weigh, then mix with water (we would use the pyrex dish and heat slightly. ) A ratio of 1g GHB to 10ml water is handy. Cool and put in 500ml water bottles. Add food colouring to prevent misuse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not done for a fee years but had success with this method. Electronic scales are helpful. If you get the amount of NaOH about right you will only need to check pH before boiling off water. But its good practice to check throughout. Particularly check before you drink anything!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can use NaOH (caustic soda) from any hardware store as long as its 99%. At first we used food grade but that was £20 and the store bought was £2. Any 1% impurities are going to be diluted hugely anyway. Same goes for deionized water, you can just use tap water.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you go above 150C you will burn it and finished product may be yellow and taste unpleasant. If as above the pH is 14 you have done something very wrong, probably best to discard.

    The recipe posted by oneroi will no doubt work, but the advantage of mine is the reflux stage where you boil of all the water to ensure complete reaction.
    <br/>
    It sounds dangerous but no more so than making soup.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You also end up with weighable solid ghb so you know the concentration of your solution. You can't keep it in this form as it is hygroscopic and will absorb water from atmosphere until a soggy mess. My brother had some success with gel caps but I always just made up 50G/500ml bottles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CAVEAT: both GBL and GHB are physically addictive and have an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome. DO NOT  use every couple of hours for days on end otherwise you will end up in a world of pain. I have been addicted to heroin over many years and believe me when I say GHB can be just as bad. It is a very powerful drug. Do not take it lightly or you will be in trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Interestingly, it is the only non opiate I have known that will treat opiate withdrawal completely. I have seen several people in full on opiate withdrawal take a dose of GHB and for the duration of the dose be absolutely fine.

    Yeah it can also work very well for alcohol or benzo withdrawal. But GHB withdrawal is also very terrible and  dangerous. Out here GHB is on the opiate list. And for heroine withdrawal Ibogaine seems to work perfectly.
    <br/>
    We can offer help and required drugs for GHB withdrawal though (we're short on the diazepam unfortunately).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People should never become addicted to GBL. Those who do usually die pretty fast.
