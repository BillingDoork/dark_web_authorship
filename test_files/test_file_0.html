    Hey, for those of you who are unaware, there is currently a full lock out taking place at the Canada Post.
    <br/>
    Previously during the rotating lockout your mail would only be delayed a day or two depending on your location, now your order will be not be shipped until they return to work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can read more about it here: http://clients.infopost.ca/en/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sucks, but hopefully things clear up and they get back to work soon :)

    I was literally just about to post a topic on this. I have yet to even hear a legitimate reason as what is causing the lockout. I've talked to my mail courier and she doesn't really know what's going on. I'm probably just paranoid but processing facility security upgrades(ie smiths detection) do come to mind. Especially with the new Harper majority might give them ability to dictate these types of things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Strange that there was just a program on natgeo about new narcotics detection scanners on the Mexican/US border than can find, in contrast, a grain of narcotic material in the space of an olympic sized swimming pool. They use spectrometry technology similar to what was used to decode the atom.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even the fact that they may be privatizing one of Canada's crown companies kinda puts me down a bit. But if it's gotta happen I just hope they are back up and running this week.

    Canada Post lockout part of a bigger agenda
    <br/>
    <br/>

    According to Jack Layton, the current Canada Post labour dispute, in which the crown corporation has locked out its workers, is a part of a much bigger picture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The NDP leader -- and leader of the Official Opposition -- tells the Calgary Herald the Harper Tories have shutdown the postal service and it makes no sense unless you put it in the context of a wider strategy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Layton feels the government wants to weaken Canadians' commitment to the postal service and ultimately sees the crown corporation being privatized.  He also feels postal service will be a pawn in future free trade deals and that eventually mail delivery will be handled by big, multi-national companies with the consumer "paying through the teeth."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In a related development, the U.S. Postal Service says as of today, it will no longer accept mail destined for Canada.  The blackout won't be lifted until service resumes here in Canada

    Postal workers should oppose this drug-detecting machines as it will reduce the number of shipments using their service. I hope these postal carriers win soon and the canadian vendors can get back to shipping.

    heres why i think the lock out happened. there was rotating strikes, full strikes could come at any time. it takes the government to stop a strike and the houses summer break begins thursday or friday of next week with 2 of those days already spoken for. so if they had not done a lock out the union could have went on full strike next thursday and the government would be on summer break until late september. so i'm pretty sure the government told canada post to lock them out by thursday of last week to ensure they could get a back to work legislation in the house before summer break begins. So really we are better off with the the lock out because with out it we could have gone until late september with no mail. it sucks but it was the right thing to do. even with minority parties blocking it we should get them back to work end of next week unless something fucked up happens.

    Yes, I have several items that have been "in transit" for well over a week now. The timing couldn't have been worse, because they were from new sellers. Hopefully, this will all be resolved in the next day or two.
