    Ok so I'm a little bit confused, I messaged him about my order and said my order will be shipped soon (12 hours ago) he never mentions anything about FEing early though
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but in the profile info, he says anything under $500 orders have to FE or else he would not ship it until I do
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so maybe the person messaging back forgot his policy? maybe different person?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is my product going to be shipped?

    Im sorry but any vendor that wants to ask for FE can suck a fat one. No way. no how. not ever. Ive lost enough to dumb vendors in the normal process let along asking to be scammed!

    If your order is under $500, then no he will not ship it unless you FE. It clearly states that in his profile. I have purchased from SuperTrips countless times, some orders being under $500 and some above. I FE'd for every order under $500 and I received my product every time.
