    okay so ive never ordered directly from SRE but friends have and i have recieved shipments before, the last shipment was intercepted by  my mother ( old house, she never checks mail.  my question is should i open  a priority p.o. box for small shipments, say 5 grams of MDMA max, is this a smart move? im just doing this to get the swing of things, i plan on opening a business box therefore no name on the package. id like advice from experienced roaders and any advice is greatly appreciated.  i will also have junk mail sent to the box so it will blend in with my other packages.  im just trying to avoid another package getting intercepted because my mom threatened to go to the cops.  advice please, experienced roaders.

    you shouldn't be getting scheduled substances shipped to your mother's house!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    maybe DVDs, cosmetics, etc. but if your mom can figure out what's in the packages maybe you should try new vendors lol

    Practical solution: Knock your mom off her perch and order whatever you want in her name, for spite  :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alternatively you could find some friends who don't live with their parents and have it delivered to them. The business PO box seems to be the best of your options though.

    <br/>
    parabol also has solid advice.

    "a business box therefore no name on the package"
    <br/>
    So if you have a business po box the name of the business is on the letter instead of your name?
