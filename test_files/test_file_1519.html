    Hi all so this is mostly common knowledge but heres a few tips from the Royal mail themselves on how not to get your package stopped by customs, And how to make everything go through plain sailing. This is probably widely known, but half the things on here i have seen people asking about  so i though i would post it to make sure everyone gets to see it. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    International Mailing Checklist
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Address your mail fully and clearly and always include the zip code or postcode and the country in English. The country must be written on the last line of the address in CAPITALS. Find out about addressing your items to Western Europe or Rest of World.
    <br/>
    Remember to include a UK return address so that we can return your mail to you if it can’t be delivered, free of charge.
    <br/>
    When using dark coloured or red envelopes, use a white label to display the address. This helps us to read it quickly and accurately.
    <br/>
    Avoid using very small or square envelopes to send cards and letters.
    <br/>
    If you need to send money use a postal order or personal cheque – avoid posting coins.
    <br/>
    Check that you’re using the correct price for the country you’re posting to - underpayment can cause delays. Check our current prices.
    <br/>
    Always check the minimum and maximum size limits as well as weight limits for the country you’re sending to before posting. You can check size and weight restrictions for the most popular destinations with our country guide.
    <br/>
    Check if any of the items you are wanting to send are restricted or prohibited.
    <br/>
    If you’re sending a packet outside the EU, you must complete a customs declaration for each item.
    <br/>
    Packaging material should protect the items enclosed from damage and be fastened securely to avoid them coming undone in transit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    recieving Mail Internationally (in the UK)
    <br/>
    All mail that enter the United Kingdom may be examined by customs, but normally letters, postcards and packets containing only documents or similar forms of correspondence are excluded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are receiving a package from overseas (unless it’s from another EU Country), please be aware that it may incur customs charges. Any package assessed as being liable for customs charges will also incur a Royal Mail handling fee of £8.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any goods imported into the UK over the value of £15 are liable to import VAT. Gifts between private individuals over the value of £36 are also liable for VAT. Goods and gifts over these values may also be liable for customs duty. You no longer have to pay customs duty for goods up to the value of £135, however you will still be required to pay import VAT and excise duty where applicable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please note that these limits do not apply to alcohol and tobacco goods where both excise duty and import VAT may be charged. It is not permitted to send alcohol and tobacco products into the UK from another EU country unless prior arrangements have been made to account for the excise duty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Top Tips So Mail Can Be Delivered ASAP
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Address your mail fully and clearly. Remember to always include the postcode which can be verified for free online using our free Postcode Finder.
    <br/>
    Return address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Include a return address on all post you send so that we can return it to you if it can’t be delivered.
    <br/>
    Envelopes
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When using dark coloured or red envelopes please use a white label to display the address.  This helps us to read the address quickly and accurately.  Also avoid using very small or square envelopes to send cards and letters.
    <br/>
    Cash and valuables
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you need to send money or valuables through the post within the UK you will need to use Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed™
    <br/>
    Correct postage paid
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check that you’re using the correct tariff when sending mail both in the UK and to overseas destinations, and remember that if you are sending an item to the Republic of Ireland, you will need to use international postage rates. Underpayment can cause delays to delivery. Check our current prices.
    <br/>
    Restricted and Prohibited goods
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are some items we can carry in the post but with restrictions and also some items we cannot carry in the post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Find out which items are restricted and also which items are prohibited.
    <br/>
    Packaging
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should select packaging that best suits the contents of your packet. Packaging material should protect the items enclosed from damage and be fastened securely to avoid them coming undone in transit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And the one thing im not sure about maybe someone could clarify would be http://www.royalmail.com/parcel-despatch-low/uk-delivery/how-buy-our-services/franking (franking.)
    <br/>
    Does it give it a more business look to blend in better? And is it anonymous?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this is usefull to someone. :)

    What you posted is I'm sure a lot of people might take heed, so +1 to you sir, however most professionals or those in the business long enough would know that authorities tend to make our job easier, as most of the time, the local police force site will tell you how they plan to tackle crime, when they would have extra patrols and more inform you when they are about to launch crackdowns, this is thanks to the media also, and it helps to pick up your local newspaper every morning, they get into detail on how they plan to execute their operations. Don't take my word, go to your local police website, you would be surprised how much counter intelligence you gain!
