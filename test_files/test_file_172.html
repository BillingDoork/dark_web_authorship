    There's almost no information about intercepted orders, at least not domestic American ones.  That may mean the people aren't around to post because they're too busy getting fucked by our medieval legal system.  Or it may mean that packages virtually never get intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A nice related vote would be "how many failed orders have you made?"  :)

    14 successfully received packages, 1 unsuccessful (order through F16, so possible it was never shipped) where I got a 100% refund of my funds in escrow. Have 7 outstanding shipments either processing or in transit.  My orders have been about 50/50 international and domestic.

    Check my signature, I believe my successful order total is 18.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One order had to be re-shipped, an early order took a long time to get because the vendor wanted me to FE when I had newbie stats and he lost my address in the shuffle because he didn't have the true FE capability available to him since he was a new vendor himself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stick with vendors who have been around for a few months and have 95+ ratings and you should be all set.

    If you're being smart about your shit then you'll be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Choose Vendors wisely,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Order Domestically
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -If you order international make sure it's not from a Drug sourced country (Colombia, Netherlands etc.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Also don't ever order bulk to your house.

    In the last month I've completed 15 transactions all flawlessly and with 12 different vendors!  Just be smart, review vendor feedback,  search the forums like your doing, and Don't finalize early unless you have an established relationship with a vendor over multiple transactions who you can trust.
    <br/>
    that's my two cents, best of luck MF!

    26 orders and only 1 reship.
    <br/>
    I don't order in big quantities and ask for letters and not parcels (gear crushed and no big rocks), I guess that helps and letters arrive faster than parcels.
    <br/>
    As said previously, always check the forums and start low when you deal with a vendor you've never experienced before.

    15 transactions now and all have come through.. Still got 3 waiting to come in but they were samples so if they dont didnt loose anything but even the sample ones have been great. I hate to speak to soon cause im relying on some Benzos to come in from Europe right now and im at the 11 day mark but so far 100% all has come in.. Mostly all US TO US. 1 from netherlands.1 Poland now waiting on Europe. So far Eirope and Poland have taken the longest ..1ST CLASS from NL took lil over 1 week

    I have had 2 that did not arrive. No customs letter or anything of the sort. Both were from the Netherlands. Both were pills.

    One was 5 pills, one was I think a 3 pill tester. This has happened later, many months ago it seemed easier to get pills from the NL to here, I did 20 at a time with ease.  Now I will not order from NL.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All others form NL was fine, and from everywhere else has been flawless. Those 2 NL vendors are top notch as well, so I know they sent it. It just didn't arrive.

    I've just asked CloudSurfer for a 50% refund because the package never arrived. No letter or anything so fuck knows what's happened to it. He doesn't say where he ships from but says its from within the EU. I'm thinking stinkybreeze might be on to something - Netherlands is too risky.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every other package has come through perfectly and all have been from the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advice is to spot the trend and stick to what works.

    Europe is absolutely fine by me (UK, Italy, Germany, etc.), just not the Netherlands. I have had no problems from any other Euro shippers. I used to get packages from the NL no problem. Not so much anymore.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way, Cloudsurfer does not ship from the Netherlands. I order from him without any problems. CRAZY  stealth shipping. Best I have seen so far.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I love that vendor.

    I've only had one issue, and that was with The Usual Suspect.  Package never arrived, but I don't think he sent it out (I finalized early to receive a discount).  He did make up for it by "resending" my order.

    The Usual Suspect could have tried calling you out saying you might be trying to scam him plus why should he resend if you FE early?

      I've only had one issue, and that was with The Usual Suspect.  Package never arrived, but I don't think he sent it out (I finalized early to receive a discount).  He did make up for it by "resending" my order.

     The Usual Suspect could have tried calling you out saying you might be trying to scam him plus why should he resend if you FE early?

    haha thanks man.  And it was one of my early purchases on the road.  Needless to say that was the last time I FE'd haha
    <br/>
    <br/>
    he gave me the dcn when i contacted him.  when i checked it, the package had been shipped but was marked as delivered in the same city it departed from.  really weird.  but again, this was a week or so before he disappeared.

    51 with 3 currently in transit, My very first order the vendor said I had to FE due to stats, took a month to get to me and i thought for sure i wouldn't receive anything but luckily it was a vendor who was honest just didn't have their shit together so i finally got it, that was the last time i ever FE'd.

    1 was a straight scam (first time, FE'd, stupid stupid)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1 the guy got busted, supposedly never even shipped the order despite insisting that he did (also FE'd)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything else so far has been perfect.  Its nice because no one ever asks for FE anymore with a perfect slate.

    <br/>
    I'm getting screwed here! Only 3 out of 9 have made it through for me. That's 6 no shows!
    <br/>
    -No letters from customs.
    <br/>
    -All orders were from reputable vendors
    <br/>
    -All were international orders
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Two of the 6 that never made it were for LSD. I don't understand how they could possibly get intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas what's going on here? I'm in Aus but 6 no shows in 3 months is bullshit.

    The poll is stupid.

    <br/>
    If you've had only 100 intercepted orders you're going to check "0-5". If you have only 5 successful orders you'll also check 0-5.

    Just check the feedback on the site.

    FE'd on first two because I'm new and they said it was required - Local guy "vanished" I was just happy to be here!  The prices are higher than what I normally pay but I can only assume the quality is top notch and packaging etc...

    <br/>
    I'm still getting the "holiday mail is delayed" bs from the first two. PeoplesDrugStore was the third - ordered next day delivery back on December 20th. No tracking, no delivery, no response - Their profile says they got out of the hospital to find the business was being run into the ground - I understand. Will you send my order now? Still no response. They haven't been online in 4 days. Gone to resolution to ask for refund...Why can't I just find a decent Canadian vendor for mdma, cocaine and percocet?

    Never trust the rating on the site.  It's a useful guide to decide if it's worth researching somebody, but you always have to do your homework on the forums.  I mean not just once, but repeatedly -- a lot of vendors burn out or disappear with a big scam or something.  Unless it's for something like $50, I never place an order without doing a quick forum check.  I can't tell you how many times that's saved me from throwing money away.

      That's a big fat 0. Nothing, nadda, zip, zero - Spent almost $600 from 4 different vendors to 2 different addresses. 2 over 30 days, 1 over 20 and another just 10 so far - ALL DOMESTIC. Tracking on 1 shows delivered but it was not - no re-ship, no refund...I get it. I'm the new guy and I'm just trying to rip them off. But I'm not really. I'd be the best customer to some of these guys if they just let me. Not a good SR experience at all.

     Never trust the rating on the site.  It's a useful guide to decide if it's worth researching somebody, but you always have to do your homework on the forums.  I mean not just once, but repeatedly -- a lot of vendors burn out or disappear with a big scam or something.  Unless it's for something like $50, I never place an order without doing a quick forum check.  I can't tell you how many times that's saved me from throwing money away.

    Very true, things can change fast so you always have to have your wits about you and constantly be on the look out for tell tale signs things are turning bad. The rating on the site doesn't count for fuck all unless you are using it in tandem with the forums and speaking to other established members re their experiences.

    I think the moral of the story is,   never FE and you will never lose money or get scammed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, I realize some require it, but I think you can always find a vendor with the same product with some research that won't require you to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly I don't see why being new should require you to finalize early,   escrow is for buyer and seller protection, right?   So what is the thinking behind a vendor wanting Fe?   Am I missing something?

    many.  sr support my very large weed consumption habit since i been here.  since i started using sr..  i haven't had any problems. Nor have i gotten ripped off.  Beats going to hood trap houses, where quality is iffy, location is hot, and there is a good chance dood will try to rip me off.    i just want weed most the time, and get annoyed by the heroin scene.. and  some stupid ass dealer asking me for a ride or some shit.

    my run ins with le  and possible violence also been stress since i left the street grind. (fingers crossed)   sr keeps me away from the presence of bad influence and trouble.

    I have never lost a single package! I reside in the Great Northwest USA! I have never FE'd. If a vendor needs me to release coins before shipping I move on down the road! DON'T DO IT!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had very little experience with ordering anything from outside the USA. I know customs and USPS idiosyncrasies, but have no idea how any other country does there shit! Out of 6 items out of over 50 that have been made to Spain, The Netherlands, Canada, Germany only 1 took 5 weeks. On that one - honestly I don't think he sent it when he said. But I am patient and it was only a gram of Amphetamine - so I just didn't think about it and kept extending his him via the 'resolve' button so it wouldn't auto-finalize.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other only took a week. I purchased first 1 gram of speed from Spain and that took 3 days! So I got 20 grams immediately because it seemed okay - that one took 2 days! I'm not even kidding! 2 days! How is that even possible? IDK, only that it happened. Waiting right now for a package from The Netherlands and going on 1 week today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best policy with any order from The Road - patience. If you didn't fuck with your name/address - it will be there!

    I live near a major US city as well and have had every single order shipped to a PO box.  Every single order has arrived without incident.  A few were from overseas, and a few were from Canada, so I had to sign for a few packages, but every single order was uneventful, no issues whatsoever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (Well, the only issue I had was an order from a vendor I trusted, had a bad batch and I had to get a partial refund outside of escrow (so not in my stats), but the vendor absolutely made it up on the next order, which more than made up for the one order that didn't pan out.  I still order from that vendor to this day.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    25 of my orders were from August 2012 to now.  Can't wait to hit the big 100 order mark!! ;-)

    I usually FE, but with HIGHLY trusted vendors where I am a usual customer.
    <br/>
    All my packages have arrived. ALL international.
    <br/>
    I have a new destination adress for each time I order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's safe to order from SR as long you dont order 1 kilo of something every other week ;) Trust me, local police will never do some CSI shit and find out you order, no digital trace will be found, atleast not in Norway, where I live.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck :)

    I think 2 of my orders were just feedback for BlueSkyTraders, so they obviously didn't involve successful shipments or add any money to the Total Spent category, just FYI.

    So I'm gonna use the knowledge I learned in my Stats class to figure out what the true probability is that a random person ordering would receive a package from Silk Road from the data received. Keep in mind that the probability that I get is going to include the following: Domestic packages, International packages, Scams (vendor never sends a package), and Intercepts. This fits binomial probability conditions and, as well, also fits the Central Limit Theorem (if you don't understand this, just know it makes the math a lot easier). Now I realize the probability will be biased because this is not a true random sample (this is only an online forum, but it is random enough for real world limitations). It is also an independent sample. Anyways, I did the best of my ability from this data to deduce the number of total packages sent to the number of successes received. Taking n = total number of packages and k = the number of successes (number of received packages), I got n = 1258 (packages in total sent) and k = 1231 (packages received). This meant that there was a probability of 0.9785 (1231/1258) of receiving a package from this study. But we want to find out what the overall probability for all packages, not just of this study. To do this, I applied the Central Limit Theorem and I am 95% confident (standard deviation = 0.004086 and to get 95% confidence, multiply by 2 and add to the study probability) that the true probability of receiving a package lies between (0.9867, 0.9704). I went even further to help newbies have the confidence of ordering by figuring out with the binomial formula what the probability of your first order being scammed/intercepted would be. I'm not gonna post the math (if you want me to, I can) but I got a probability of 0.0215 (which means for your first purchase, you have a 2.15% chance of it being intercepted). If you order only domestically from top rated vendors (check the forums for good 99-100 vendors and don't finalize early), this probability percentage of 2.15% goes way down even further.
    <br/>

    Now I'm off for a beer. Cheers everyone!

    I fucked up once because this pack didnt arrive in time and i went on vacation for spring break. when i returned it already finalized, kinda pissed about it and makes me want to start over, but i have a 900$ order in the works now that will help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never lost a package *knock on wood*, but one is currently MIA, which is preventing me from finalizing on my order.. unless the vendor has not shipped it

    Is it just me that feels like telling everyone how many illegal transactions you have made via SR is a bad idea? I mean, play the game how you want to. But, the way I see it, if you are on here saying "I do massive amounts of orders", then you are probably going to be one of the first targets. This also leads into putting your purchasing stats in your forum signature. Why the hell do that? Some kind of ego boost? It is just spitting in the face of LE (which doesn't bother me) but I am sure it gives them more of a drive to find your ass. Just curious if anyone else feels this way or not? ???

Imagine the resources it would take to try to investigate everyone on here.

    I guess my biggest thought on this is, IF FOR WHATEVER REASON LE DOES link your forum acc to your SR acc, you are royally fucked. It would be nothing more than a personal confession of  however many transactions you made. Which then turns into separate charges and consecutive sentences. Maybe I stay on edge over these things, like a lot of others around here. But, to each his own. I will admit it is nice to see the success rate people have had.

    Most of those who are scammed didn't listen and finalized early anyway.

    Over 50, so far ive only had at most like 30 not show up out of quite a few orders, but i'm sure several of them were never shipped in the first place because of sellers thinking they can get away with it because of australias customs reputation.

    2 no-shows (maybe 3 now). The 2 that are confirmed no-shows were small-ish orders from the Netherlands when I was still very new. One might have shipped, I'm certain the other never did. Lesson learned: never order from the Netherlands to the USA.

    It's all relative....depends if you're ordering domestically in which case you ought to have a near 100% success rate versus o/s orders, also found certain stuff like tabs gets through more successfully compared to powders/pills. And lastly, depends which country you live in.

    I've have about 11 successful transactions here. 10/11 have been super-stealthy with no issues. I use PGP 100% of the time, launder my BTC before it gets to SR, and don't sign for shit. Haven't ran into issues yet. The one time I had issues was when an Indian seller mailed me 10 prescriptions in a flimsy green envelope made of paper-mache. Other than that, I stick to domestic only and get great service.

    In all seriousness, this site is awesome, has made me a ton of money and hooked alot of people up with high quality goods, unavailable in my location. Out of a little over 60 transactions, probably 3 didn't show, 2 of them were confirmed never to have been shipped. Other one I probably got scammed on. Either way success rate is incredibly high, even for international. Trust goes a long way, I'm glad to see it is present on SR.

    So naw not digital orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I consider them all successful because I was able to receive a refund/reship or the loss wasn't significant enough to be remembered.
