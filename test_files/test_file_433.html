    I received a package today that I was starting to worry about, as the delivery seemed to be taking longer than expected. I figured it would be because of christmas, but now that it has arrived, I think it's clear why it was taking a little extra time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My house number was put wrong by the vendor (only by one digit) - so the postal service must have been figuring out whether it should be being sent to the house number or the name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the end they obviously sent it to the name, and it doesn't seem to have been opened. Although I am concerned that it would have been in their possession for probably a few days while they sorted it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think it will be safe for me to carry on ordering from SR right away?

    I have no special knowledge in a scenario like this, but personally I wouldn't be overly worried.

    As long as the delivery arrived, I can find no reason why you should be worried. Just send a good thought to the nice people at the post office, who figured out the address didn't fit the name, and corrected it, without compromising your privacy.

    This is not uncommon.  That's their job, to correctly address misaddressed items.  It just means it took a little longer.  Unless they show up at your door asking you to sign for it I wouldn't worry.

    Dont be too paranoid, you got it and you say the package wasnt opened, then you are clear. Just say thanks to the mailman next time you see it.

    Cool, cheers for the reassurance. It's just with all the talk of things like "do or don't use your real name" etc. - with most people saying you should, I was a little worried it may have raised suspicion. But it's all good then - time to order something else ;D

    I think your perfectly fine, if they knew you had drugs in the package they would of kept it. Your local post office gets all the mail to your zip code, from thiere it gets sorted. The mailman picks up a presorted bag and if hes good he will be able to make educated corrections to errors. He delivered your mail because he saw the error but remembered your correct address, that means hes good at his job. No worries man :)

    Yeah, as long as you got it man! You're in US like me I assume.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a bunch of amphetamines sent to Chicago, when I'm in rural NY!!! - The zip was right, but the city was wrong!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor was ready to ship me more, and then I got it, written on it, they crossed out Chicago, and circled the zip and wrote (try using this) I guess a smart postal worker wrote it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The US postal system is one of the best. Don't believe foreign vendors that complain. - It's the damn "customs" people that delay shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets hope these people don't get laid off!! Good ol US Gov't bails out car companies, but can't bail out it's own postal system?!?!?!   - Come on Obama, give somma dat treasury to da mailman! As you said you gotta "spread it around" as I recall to "Joe" the plumber!

    I would just like to point out: THIS is precisely the reason a fake name or that of a previous tenant can be a terrible mistake to make (or one that never comes back to bite you at all).  They really do pay attention.  This incident says it all.
