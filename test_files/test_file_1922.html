    this link has numerous submitted news reports and some are about people getting caught with weed through mail. in all cases/reports I read, it seems everyone got busted for not following one of the profiling reasons (I.E Fake name, fake return address, already received a love letter, over 3 lbs beings shipped, shipping going with usps, Etc) in all these cases the package was never sniffed by a dog first, they were all flagged for suspicion then sent to a drug dog! just thought Id point out again how important it is to go by the standard guidelines thats stated in all over the  forums and requested by top vendors!
    <br/>
    thanks hope this helps people from getting busted!

    I believe some people use stupid/unrealistic names which they can prolly check name with address in their system and see if its legit, if it's not that's the red flag for drug dog to come sniff.  I dont see it being possible to check each and every return address however, which makes sense since I know people have got packages useing fake names! I would bet that it has to do with the PI's knowing zip codes in their areas?  I do know that some of those busted in the articles were flagged bc the mail Currier knew  either  that no one by that name lives there or they knew it was vacant. I do know the USPIS does not have drug dogs.  They do however partner with local leo when suspicious package's come in. But I also read that the FEDs like FBI help out in big locations or if they have any treat of bombs. But I believe the biggest red flag would be a single address receiving a first class packages every week or when ever, from the same state which happens to be a "drug state". I wonder if they have any type of computerized records of your packages of what you got and who from. surely not. But bottom line seems to be if you use the common shipping methods used on here by the top vendors ( and not buy/ship multiple lbs!) and  make sure the buyer uses correct info , then its nearly impossible to get intercepted. I am actually on day 9 of waiting on a package from a vendor that went into stealth mode after the day he shipped it. and wont respond to any messages. kinda worried about that... hence why I have been up every-night doing research haha!

    I spent quite a bit of time studying this very issue, and from what I read I gathered that the fake return addresses were usually spotted by a person, not a machine.  This backs up personal observations I have made at several post office locations in my area--when the packages are scanned in by a person, each package has a set of eyeballs on it.  An obviously fake address would stand out to someone who has worked in the area for awhile.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How would they know it's a fake address?  In a small town, you would be surprised how well the PO employees know the street addresses and street numbering systems.  I'm not sure how this would play out in metro area post offices, though.

    On first thought, it seems like they would have record of each mail delivered to a person and record of who sent it, but that would require someone has to scan or type that info into the system, and the amount of mail the usps goes through in a year would seem impossible to retain that much information, so if they do, it only seems believable that any records  kept, would be for a limited time.

    Ahhh a half truth. They do have a list or names and addresses but it is not set in stone and sending a realistic name to an address that has never gotten mail for than name simple updates the list. It is a reference list should a package come in with the address destroyed and the name present.  The only time the PO bounces mail based on a name is if it is a Post Office Box at the post office. You have to register every name you want to receive mail for at the box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the most part a postman does not care, it is a job and a monotonous one at that. They simple sort and deliver mail and try to get though the day. They don't care what they are delivering. Sure, if it sticks out, is an obvious fake name, or smells it will set off flags but for the most part if it looks like any other piece of mail it will be delivered like any other piece of mail.

    Think of how little harddrive space it takes to store date, address, return etc (take a look at how big a giant txt file is). I'd wager that not only is it possible for them to keep it forever but it would not even cost that much. I think the hardest bit would be designing the database so that it could easily be searched given that many entries but even that ought to be rather trivial in modern day.

    i think what they mean is if you put your package in outgoing mail on 555 gold street, and the return address isnt a house on that street, then that would be fishy.

    AHHHH! I've read so many USPS conspiracies since joining these forums lol. In the end this is speculation turned to paranoia. Even if any of this is true, liek others have stated, the information is used for much more practical purpose to solve more common problems that the post office would care about. LE doesn't manage any major change in the domestic post office system, the USPS management does this, with a budget involved, which always includes a cost-benefit analysis or similar planning. I don't doubt the substantial amounts of money the DEA would potentially waste, however. I am Canadian, and very much against the DEA and the American judicial system.

    This is not 1969, if you don't think the government (let alone Google, Facebook, your ISP and other internet properties) know a LOT more about you than you think, you are completely ignorant. This is the 21st century, science fiction we read about 20 years ago is here. There are necessary steps you must take, the only reason everyone isn't getting done for this is because of the sheer amount of mail/people far outnumber what paid staff can look at.

      How is a postal inspector ever going to know the real name of the person living there, or that the return address doesn't exist.

     I spent quite a bit of time studying this very issue, and from what I read I gathered that the fake return addresses were usually spotted by a person, not a machine.  This backs up personal observations I have made at several post office locations in my area--when the packages are scanned in by a person, each package has a set of eyeballs on it.  An obviously fake address would stand out to someone who has worked in the area for awhile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     How would they know it's a fake address?  In a small town, you would be surprised how well the PO employees know the street addresses and street numbering systems.  I'm not sure how this would play out in metro area post offices, though.

     On first thought, it seems like they would have record of each mail delivered to a person and record of who sent it, but that would require someone has to scan or type that info into the system, and the amount of mail the usps goes through in a year would seem impossible to retain that much information, so if they do, it only seems believable that any records  kept, would be for a limited time. I am just using an educated guess of course!
