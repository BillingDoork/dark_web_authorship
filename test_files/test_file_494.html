    Please contribute any practical-creative, or experiential knowledge for successful transferring US dollars through USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The subjective amount is 10,000USD. The season is Christmas/NewYears. The destination is Portland, Oregon. The departure is Albany, New York. There is only one address, but multiple drops are viable. The funds are available in the highest denomination. A smaller package/envelope is preferred as practical
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This query is not regarding an SR payment; please forgo any comments about escrow. Other ethical considerations related to payment transfer and functional alternatives are welcome, BUT please focus on "HOW TO: Stealth pack Money for Mail".

    Have your funds available in the highest denominations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vacuum seal your money. This will significantly decrease its physical profile, while containing specific identifying odors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Conceal your cash within another item. (The best items will appear natural in the mail). Creative input?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to maintain your anonymity, incase of detection, you'll have to take packaging precautions more thoroughly discussed in general shipping threads.

    At this volume you may want to consider Postal service money orders or regular money orders that dont require ID on either side and are easily verifiable over the phone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never buy money orders over 2000 dollars in cash at one time or one location I would say from my experience 1500 (been working in banking for a while) then you have about 10 1000 money orders ship em boom your good to go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is of course if this is an option.

    The 5k is only for merchandise. For cash or negotiable items, etc the limit is $15.

     Limit on money (cash) insurable through the mail
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Money (currency / cash) that is sent through the mail can be insured with the following limits:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Except for Registered Mail, the maximum indemnity for negotiable items (defined as instruments that can be converted to cash without resort to forgery), currency, or bullion, is $15.00
     <br/>
     For Registered Mail™, cash can be insured up to $25,000. For amounts over $25,000, the full value must be declared but the maximum insured value is $25,000
     <br/>
     When a claim is filed, money is replaced at the insured value as indicated above only:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After evidence of value is shown (if the actual value was less than the insured amount, then only the actual value is paid)
     <br/>
     Important: If you are sending a significant amount of cash, you need to verify with your local office what is considered valid evidence of value before mailing the item. You should also verify that it is packaged securely enough to protect a high value item from being harmed during regular mail processing.
     <br/>
     After the claim process is complete
     <br/>
     Please Note: Checks are not considered cash, and cannot be insured other than for document reconstruction expense.
