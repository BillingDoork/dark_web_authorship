    Anyone who takes transit in the Toronto area regularly has likely seen the newest ads for "Buffer Box". It's new to Toronto and I believe it is in use in other countries. I haven't looked into it much yet because I'm a bt busy but I just got a call from someone reminding me about it. Anyways, take a look for yourself on their website. Seems to be a commuter friendly temporary mailbox that u rent for very limited amounts of time. It looks quite interesting!

    Doubt it. I've used this before (for regular mail, before they got bought by Google) and the boxes are usually in indoor / pretty private locations. Would be hard to keep a special eye on.

    I think what mito is saying is that there exists another reason to watch a piece of mail when it ends up in one of these locations, not necessarily that there is a perpetual "stake out", so to speak.  I have to say this gives me a bit of a hard on!  But then I realized that this isn't an ideal place to get caught picking up a package.  It's clearly an indication of guilt to travel specifically to pick up a package.  Even if you have additional reasons for being in this area remote to where you live, it could be argued that there is no way an enemy would send you a package this way, because you'd have to be cooperating with the sender to accept.  Unlike the home address acceptance, which could have been sent by anyone and also which an innocent person's conduct varies little from a guilty persons.  (pick it up, take it in..just like every day mail)
    <br/>
    This might be a great idea if you want to ship domestic with superior stealth, and I could see the usefulness in this convenience.  I'm quite excited to see this.  But I'd advise against international delivery acceptance through these guys.  As a criminal defense atty, these surrounding circumstances might make innocence highly unlikely.  Perhaps there is a local person who can pick up on your behalf?  I'll keep a close eye on this thread.  This could be big.  Thanks and +1 to OP

    Ah yes that's the nae.. 'Buffer Box', the recent pilot run of drop boxes along busy commuter routes in the Toronto-Area. I'm bumping this post to spread awareness and to see if anyone has experience wit this service yet. UK's MyByBox is a similar new service on the western side of the pond, with a user in a recent post worried about the frailty of the box and subsequent security vulnerability.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If no one tries this b the end of June I'll utilize it and report back.

    Edit: Ignore this last message. I just read everything. This is quite amazing. The only thing I am wondering about is the tax/duty comment. If there does happen to be one (due to the item being shipped internationally), I wonder how it is paid. Also, do you pay cash once you arrive at the bufferbox? Or are only electronic forms of payment accepted?

    do you have supply 2 forms of government id one being a photo like obtaining a po box?
    <br/>
    main reason i never got a po box. you have to use fake id otherwise it makes no sense to get one. i havent seen any fake ids good enough to use on locals. they might pass in another province or country but people here might be trained to spot fake ones. and they have all those holograms and swip sticks. i would so much rather be shipping to a box registered to a fake name!

    I have seen it a number of times in other posts, but there is little good that comes from a fake id on a mailbox. Your only protection is then mail fraud, which if there wasn't a case before they investigated, there will be one very shortly after.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The person that looks like he's trying to hide something, is probably hiding something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the original note... I don't think I'd trust something that is advertised to be obviously used in the ways most of us would use it. To begin with, their process already kind of red flags for me. They require you to ship to a buffer box address, however that address is not the box itself. The parcel goes to one of their warehouses, and is then delivered by one of their own delivery employees. I have a hard enough time trusting one company to deliver things right and on time. The service seems like its intension is to solve that "I ordered something but I'm gone for a few days" type thing, where you aren't there to sign for it. It's a novel idea, but I don't get the impression that the service is really intended for you to use frequently - and I would assume frequent use would drive some attention.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The delivery is done to what seems like a computer-driven vending machine type recepticle, though they aren't very clear on that. Vending machines break, no matter the equipment or the OS driving them. I would really hate to see a "feed" error turn into a... messy result. That's without even being paranoid about the existence of computer driven receiving. Post office employees may make mistakes, but once a computer is compromised you may as well post your pin code on twitter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In addition, the gov. isn't about to allow a parcel service get away with everything... I am sure in order to place these machines on areas considered city property, some sort of discussion went on around this. Especially in the face of the whole, Rob Ford thing.

    You can make an account just using a google plus account, very easy to fake. No fake ID's needed. If you don't want to use it often then just get another account with different information and maybe choose a different default pickup location.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only things I'd be worried about is international packages getting flagged because of the weird buffer box code it gives you to include in the address and picking stuff up from there. If you get busted after the police see you enter the pin you are pretty much fucked. This is the problem with all drops where you pick up the goods in person though, here there would be no plausible deniability in this situation because you have the pin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it'd be good for the occasional large package, the spy vs spy game of picking up in person isn't worth the trouble for smaller amounts.
