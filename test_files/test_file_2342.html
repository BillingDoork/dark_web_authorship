    Having done some research with a number of OS vendors re success rate of shipping to Oz it really doesn't seem like much is getting through of late, my own recent order included! Anyone else experiencing this?

    From my experience, some vendors really pay attention to detail and package items in such a professional manner that it's just incredible. On the other hand, there are vendors who literally don't give a shit if your package arrives or not, probably cause a lot of their buyers have FE for them anyway. Trial and error, through your own research, is the best way to narrow down the list. I hope your aware of the world wide crack down of illegal and counterfeit goods purchased online and being shipped to countries world wide, which is currently under way, called OPERATION PANGEA V. It's a major, annual operation, conducted by Interpol in conjunction with Authorities in each country, which doesn't conclude until 3/10/12. There have been a few threads started here with all the details, should you wish to do some reading on it.
    <br/>
    When you find a vendor who is always looking to improve there shipping methods, stick with them. You know that they are putting in the effort to ensure delivery, something I really appreciate.

    Sometimes I think this is a ready excuse for when a package does not turn up (does not get sent).
    <br/>

    Its easier for a vendor to say that customs are awesome and your shit was seized, while they send your order to someone else.

    Operation Pangaea doesn't mean you won't get your package.  Australia's already hell to get stuff through customs though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean even if they "crack down" on it, they still can't hold up the mail just to bust a few buyers, it doesn't make logistical sense.  Unless your packages reek of weed most people are still receiving things.

    yeah dude but minimum wage is like 18 dollars or some shit now (they changed it after i moved back to the united states). i mean fuck cigarettes are like 20 dollars a pack now or something so... it's better to pay a little bit more for something and get it than pay a little bit less and run a huge risk of not getting it.

    If international packages (personal quantities) are not arriving for a buyer, unless either the vendor or yourself are being watched by the Authorities, IMO, it means their packaging is not up to scratch. The good vendor's of the stuff I like don't have a problem shipping to Aust and it always arriving. It's due to their effort in constantly improving and refining their packaging techniques and using only quality materials to package their goods. Remember not so long ago,  MIMM asked buyers to send him any ideas they had (or photos) of ways he could improve his packaging and even offered samples for those that did if I remember correctly. It's that sort of effort that would give me more confidence in a vendor's package arriving over other vendor's. So far for me, MIMM has been 100% successful.  :)
