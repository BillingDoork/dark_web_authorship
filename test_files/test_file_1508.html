    I plan on traveling a couple of times the next 12 months for a couple of massive music fests and want know the best way to go about on ordering products from the road to the hotel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last month going to Vegas I had a dozen or so mdma caps hidden and mixed in my pill/vitamin week organizers in my check-in luggage. On the way back I forgot to take out a 3 g worth of medical bud I got from there and made it back home lol. It worked but it was still a stupid thing to risk when I should have shipped them in the first place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously if I planned to order from multiple vendors Id probably order to myself then place in one package but in terms of having ordering from a single vendors for most stealth: Should I order and ship to myself then ship to the hotel before I leave, OR should I just order and use the proper hotel address information with my name as the shipping address a couple of days before I arrive?

    Music festivals are well known for having an abundance of people selling drugs that aren't what they say they are. MDMA is often methylone or another cathinone, increasingly NBOMes are being sold as LSD. If you want to be sure that what you're taking is the real thing, it's very wise to bring your own drugs to a festival.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the OP, if you are 100% confident in the stealth of your vendor by all means have the vendor ship it to the hotel, if you have any doubts and a good handle on stealth shipping yourself, just do it that way.

    This.

    <br/>
    I usually just get them from friends that also go but its starting harder to find. Weed was easy to find in vegas but like previously stated, its hard to start to find authentic mdma and medical bud unless you know who u getting from.
