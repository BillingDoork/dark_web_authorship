    So do we still use them for getting tracking numbers, we just don't have to pay the additional 45 cents? Or do they no longer work at all and we have to go into the post office to get tracking?  I cannot

    Green DCN labels are now defunct and should not be used, according to the new policy. Stamped Priority Mail packages are supposed to be dropped off at the counter, and having them scanned in and a label will be added to the package, and the same number will be printed on a receipt. Essentially, they're trying to avoid anonymous drops now. There are already several topics on this though, so you really didn't need to start a new one.

    Please refer to my other post for all the details about the new changes:

    Yes I understand there are other threads; I wanted a specific line of questioning answered and didn't want to hijack any threads.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SO, if we had some of those in the mail pick-up blue bins on Sunday (or Saturday after 5:30pm) will they still be used/shipped?

    I think you are plenty safe. They may not scan the DCN but if you have enough postage on it then I don't understand why they would RTS.

    Yep, I had speculated that they might still accept the lie green DCN labels for a short period of time. Heck, hardly any of the clerks knew about the new changes in their entirety, why would the people who simply deliver and collect the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But do realize there is still going to be a small level of risk, if you choose to continue using the lime green labels, that they might one day just not process it and simply return it to the sender with a note addressing the required changes, or they might opt to just send it on through without scanning the label.

    farmer1, I trust your knowledge so I am asking you: what is the thing now about allowing anonymous drops into either mailboxes or mailslots inside post offices, as long as it's under 13 ounces? I want to continue to use the green DCN stickers to track, but am adamant about NOT leaving things at the counter (cameras, etc; what if order is from LE? They would be able to track the package down to my face on video. That's like doomsday for me.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess I could try doing experiments, shipping packages to myself using the above methods; if I receive them OK, then it still works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you know anything definite about all this? If you can't use DCN stickers anymore, even with first class parcel, then that means you have to rely on packages getting there without knowing for sure (no trackling). This is nerve wracking to say the least.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, what does RTS mean? I'm embarrassed to admit I don't remember hearing this term before.

    I think hyperocity means well as he tries to help us through this transition. I am hopeful that his comments about the USPS 'finding our acillies heel' (other thread) and " they're trying to avoid anonymous drops now" are premature assumptions about the intent of the USPS. Those dire comments may be accurate or there may just be a failure of the USPS to get their act together and provide the usual options to customers. Until things settle down I expect they will honor (or at least allow the packages to move along with) the old stickers if enough postage is attached. After all customers are just getting used to the changes as are the USPS staff. If the policy has changed though, what happens to work now, may not work when they tighten up enforcement of their guidlines. So, any tests in the mail today might not prove things will work later.

    I hate to say this, but a lot of you people need to read the USPS rules/regulations instead of speculating on this forum and getting absolutely no where. There isn't a change to the DCN. I've ask a couple of clerks and the only thing that has changed is the postage.

    My DCNs went through and are recognized in the system. Will USPS stop the use of DCN slips in the future? Yes, it's possible. It's also possible that they do something else or get rid of another thing we're accustomed to, but for now you can use them. If for some reason I happen to be wrong then I'm wrong and you and I will learn once we drop a package off and the customer receives the order, but we can't view the DCN online.

    Just consider that if you continue with business as usual with proper stampage, &amp; until you run out of DCN's be prepared to start doing reships!  There will be a learning curve both internal &amp; external with USPS, but the reality is you will be able to get DCN's added to first class mail at least for a while, however The DCN aspect will change over to tracking &amp; will not work with priority shipments.  If you do an online based postage system your tracking will work fine but it will have nothing to do with DCN's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So aside from the fact that you cannot keep grabbing the green DCN's, &amp; while they will probably still work this week, and maybe through next month, it would be improper to assume it will continue when they are no longer obtainable.

    <br/>
    Anyway, the people at my local post office (obviously it varies) said if theres a green DCN tag on it it will be sent, but it will not be scanned (at least at this post office, and may even be removed or redacted)... so it seems in my case it would be like shipping without tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whats the point?

    Hello Everyone,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As NCK stated get the white tracking labels the most you can order over the phone is 400. Go to your post office and ask for the white tracking labels and they should give them to you. The white labels work exactly the same as a DCN. The postal worker I spoke to said, "They white labels were placed online for a little while and then pulled off because they deiced to place it somewhere else on the site."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS: Postal worker said the white tracking labels are back ordered till Thursday.
    <br/>

    Thanks,

    So this white slip....I can't find anything on it.  The old one was a PS Form 152, which the guy at the post office said is no longer any good.  Seems even they have alot of confusion, as they were just told about it.   He said you can still mail any priority pack 13 oz and under in any blue box, but to get tracking you either need to print online postage or come to the counter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone elaborate on this white slip?  It doesn't seem to make sense to keep this white slip around if they are changing everything.   They want to force people to print postage online to make it easier for them, and this is part of it.

    Look, we can still mail packs anonymously. When they say, "Can be used at the time of mailing." it means when you drop the package off at the counter, postal driver or USPS mail box(blue) as long as you have the appropriate postage. If you have the postage in stamps then you use stamps. You can attach the tracking slips to the packs and drop them off, but make sure you have the correct postage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, I did notice that the postal employee that mailed some express packs use the Express(18.95) stamps and then added a printed $1.00 stamp. I'm sure they're trying to erradicate the stamps or they're clearing house of those stamps to make way for the updated ones.

    According to a different postal worker, at a different post office: They need to get rid of all of the old stamps before they can get the new ones. This particular PO had orders in for the new express and priority (19.95 and 5.60) stamps over a month before the change over and the orders were simply canceled because there were still 5.15 and 18.95 available.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      My DCNs went through and are recognized in the system. Will USPS stop the use of DCN slips in the future? Yes, it's possible. It's also possible that they do something else or get rid of another thing we're accustomed to, but for now you can use them. If for some reason I happen to be wrong then I'm wrong and you and I will learn once we drop a package off and the customer receives the order, but we can't view the DCN online.

     Just consider that if you continue with business as usual with proper stampage, &amp; until you run out of DCN's be prepared to start doing reships!  There will be a learning curve both internal &amp; external with USPS, but the reality is you will be able to get DCN's added to first class mail at least for a while, however The DCN aspect will change over to tracking &amp; will not work with priority shipments.  If you do an online based postage system your tracking will work fine but it will have nothing to do with DCN's.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So aside from the fact that you cannot keep grabbing the green DCN's, &amp; while they will probably still work this week, and maybe through next month, it would be improper to assume it will continue when they are no longer obtainable.

    If the green DCN slips aren't removed, but aren't scanned, I still think that's enough to convince the average buyer that it was tracked and prevent them from scamming you. But let's face it, the scammers will be smarter than this. So, my best recommendation is to start printing labels online using an account tied to a prepaid card if you want to avoid the potential for the package not to be tracked. Again, every mail carrier is different. One may not care, and will scan the label until told otherwise. Another may care more about their job, and will obey the new policy right away. We just don't know who will obey, and who won't until they're repremanded. And there's no telling when they'll be reprimanded, if so. So at any time, your anonymous drops with green DCN labels could stop getting scanned. Just be ready, or stop complaining and start using online with a prepaid card if you want to continue dropping packages into the blue boxes.
    <br/>

    Also, don't use Tor or your normal WiFi connection. :)

      Green DCN labels are now defunct and should not be used, according to the new policy. Stamped Priority Mail packages are supposed to be dropped off at the counter, and having them scanned in and a label will be added to the package, and the same number will be printed on a receipt. Essentially, they're trying to avoid anonymous drops now.....

     I think hyperocity means well as he tries to help us through this transition. I am hopeful that his comments about the USPS 'finding our acillies heel' (other thread) and " they're trying to avoid anonymous drops now" are premature assumptions about the intent of the USPS. Those dire comments may be accurate or there may just be a failure of the USPS to get their act together and provide the usual options to customers. Until things settle down I expect they will honor (or at least allow the packages to move along with) the old stickers if enough postage is attached. After all customers are just getting used to the changes as are the USPS staff. If the policy has changed though, what happens to work now, may not work when they tighten up enforcement of their guidlines. So, any tests in the mail today might not prove things will work later.

    Well, it could always just be a case of USPS wanting to see more of our smiling faces, or simply a ploy to get more people to convert to using an online account, but I think with the message I saw on the APC on Monday, the reasoning behind these new changes is very clear: "security". And by that, they do mean the intent to ship drugs too.

     Now, I did notice that the postal employee that mailed some express packs use the Express(18.95) stamps and then added a printed $1.00 stamp. I'm sure they're trying to erradicate the stamps or they're clearing house of those stamps to make way for the updated ones.

    DCN, of you still have them, won't be scanned if you drop them off at a box, as it says clearly you have to buy the 152 it at the counter.

    The PO will give you the new white USPS tracking slips at the counter if you ask. You can add them to any priority mail package for no charge. You can drop them off anonymously at a blue box just like you could with the green DCN slips.

    I wonder if Farmer1 got whole rolls or just a length of paper but it might be safer not to answer that if you got like 3 rolls. Anyway, I was also wondering if they are numbered (and in order)? I'd guess the bar code on em has a number Even if they don't seem to. So, getting various batches would seem like a good idea (then stop using a batch if one does not arrive). I might be overthinking this tho.

    Gents, pulled this information from here: http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/503.htm#1063871
    <br/>
    <br/>
    11.2.5 Service Options
    <br/>
    <br/>
    [1-27-13] The two USPS Tracking/Delivery Confirmation service options are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a. Retail option: Available at the time of mailing and a mailing receipt is provided. A mailer may mail articles with retail option USPS Tracking/Delivery Confirmation (Form 152) affixed at a Post Office, branch, or station, or give articles to a rural carrier. A mailer may also present Standard Post or Priority Mail packages to a retail employee at a Post Office, station, or branch and the retail associate will affix a USPS Tracking/Delivery Confirmation label to the package at no additional charge. Mailers can access delivery information over the Internet at www.usps.com or by calling 1-800-222-1811 toll-free and providing the article number.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    b. Electronic option: Privately printed forms or labels or Label 400 options are available to mailers who establish an electronic link with the USPS to exchange acceptance and delivery data. Since no mailing receipt is provided with the electronic option, mailers wishing to obtain a mailing receipt may use Form 3877 (11.2.8).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    11.3.1 Types of Labels
    <br/>
    <br/>
    [1-27-13] Mailers not printing their own labels must use one of the label options shown below (for additional information see Publication 91, Confirmation Services Technical Guide):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a. Form 152, obtained from the Post Office at no charge. This form may be used only with the retail option (see Exhibit 11.3.1a, Form 152).
    <br/>
    Shows Form 152, Delivery Confirmation receipt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    b. Label 400 is intended for use by electronic option mailers, and may be affixed to mailpieces by an associate when an applicable mailpieces are presented at retail locations without postage validation imprint (PVI) capability.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    c. Privately printed barcoded labels must meet the requirements in 11.3 and 11.4 and must include an Intelligent Mail package barcode prepared under 11.4 and 708.5.0. On the Priority Mail label, mailers must use the registered trademark symbol following the Priority Mail text or add the following statement at the bottom of the label in at least 6-point Helvetica type: “Priority Mail is a registered trademark of the U.S. Postal Service.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    d. Integrated Retail Systems Labels may be affixed to mailpieces, as applicable, by a retail associate when presented by a mailer at a Post Office, station, or branch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts?

    Well, what does it mean? Do those label 400 get stuck on by oneself or does it have to be by a postal employee? I want to use it to drop off either first class mail parcels or priority mail in a mailbox, not going in to the PO. Will this do it? And, what exactly is electronic option mailers? Do you give up your anonimity by doing this?

    Apparently this is not a problem for some vendors.  I messaged one vendor in particular and they said this only affects them by raising the price he has to pay to ship priority mail.

    Well you maybe incurring the pain in the ass fee... think about it.. your seller's need to go into the local PO and say "Hey, gimme 3 or 4 hundge of the new "white tracking labels".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did it today and they only provided a few - hopefully they'll loosen up as they continue to lose money
    <br/>
    <br/>
    other than that - Do you want to be that person inline asking for them?

    I am reposting this in various tracking label threads in case it is true - sorry to be repetitive.-
    <br/>
    I was told recently that the Free tracking on priority mail is only if you buy the postage online or take the package to the counter. She claimed that even if you have the "400 labels" you have to pay $0.90 more postage for tracking if you drop in a blue box with stamps. I'm not even sure she was saying you could add the extra postage as stamps? I don't trust this information although she seemed to think she was an expert on the subject. She gave me a bunch of different bar code labels she said did not add tracking (even though they say "USPS Tracking #" in bold print) but would keep the package moving through their system faster. These labels are not #400 and do not have the little extra strip on the bottom with a copy of the tracking number to keep.
