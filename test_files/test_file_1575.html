    I'm not making this up or smocking crack. These guys aren't stupid. If i see the mailman running the route on the other side of the street, i know that i've got 45 minutes till he makes it to my mailbox. I smoke outside of the house, so I time my cigarette at th3 same time as the mailman's delivery. Am thinking that might look suspicious happening to be there alot of the times when i get an express or priority envelope. Would the Mailman report suspicious behavior like that or am i being paranoid?

    lol, why don't you just stay the fuck inside and peek out your window, wait the extra 5 minutes until he can no longer see you and then grab your mail if you are worried about it.

    personally if you're anxious over this i'd arrange another drop location from what i've learned CD's never happen to a place that is shipped to once they usually CD places that have two of the same package coming at the same time, they usually let the first one go through then CD the second one.  sooo pretty much I wouldn't suggest using an address for more than 3 ships per little while, that's if youre super paranoid.. and if your vendor's stealth sucks. If it's standard letter mail seriously theirs nothing to worry about. but as tman said  do not wait around no matter how excited you are time your cigarrette 5 minutes after drop off.  if you have a alternate address i'd use that for the next month if you have frequent purchases.

    i'm a mailman. i've worked with hundreds of mailmen. none of us has ever, ever given a shit about anything except for getting done with our freaking route and going home. either you look scary to him somehow or you're being paranoid... tons of people get packages by the fuckload regularly. people order stuff and some people order lots. whatever.

    Maybe you just misinterpreted his "look." Many people aren't that great at reading other people's expressions or body language even while sober and with good sleep. I think it goes without saying that being involved with SR gives most people anxiety for temporary periods at least. Just as he has a routine, so do you--and your routine involves smoking a cigaratte at a certain hour of the day. (Obviously it's better if this is a consistent habit and not just one on days you're waiting for your package.) You may have to come to terms with the idea that nobody cares about you :/

    You're being unreasonably paranoid. Over a year ago I made an order and two days later I notice the mailman drive by slooowly, then he makes a turn and comes back down our city block. Then I don't get any mail for a day or two, which is very strange. Then my order arrived just fine ~~ nothing happened after I picked it up and I got several other orders in the months that followed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything's probably OK.  Chances are good that you'll get to enjoy your order in peace &amp; quiet.

    I always made a point to wait until the mailman is out of view to get the mail, it's more shame of looking like a loser than paranoia. You're being paranoid though. If it makes you feel better you could time out your smoking so you finish up when he's a few houses away, put the butt in the ashtray and walk inside, to make it seem like a coincidence. Or light up another cigarette after the mail gets delivered, so he'll think you're just a chain smoker and it's also a coincidence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously though, you have nothing to worry about.

    For our safety, we all should be a little paranoid and VERY careful. There is a huge difference, however, between being careful and acting paranoid. Someone who is ACTING paranoid stands out like a sore thumb, and that is the exact opposite of what we should strive for. IMO, standing outside waiting for your mail is acting paranoid.

    You're fine bro.  It's summer time and you're enjoying a cig so that doesn't seem odd.  If you really want to give a good impression pull up a chair and have a beer in hand and the dude won't think anything of it.  Now if it was winter and snow's coming down hard it might look somewhat suspicious but the fact that a lot of people I know have to step outside to smoke because of roommates makes it not suspicious at all.  Do you say hi to the postman?  Strike up a conversation.  Football season's coming up.  Ask him/her who they're pulling for.  And do like I do when I'm paranoid and worrying, order some valium/xanax and just veg out.

    He may not even think there is anything in the package, he may just think, "If I come around and this gay dude eye fucks me one more time while he's outside smoking a cigarette waiting for me I swear I'm going to quit my job!"

     I have done the pull up a chair with a cig and a beer RIGHT next to my mailbox haha.  What a summer that was.  Mailmen seem pretty chill but dont act like a sketchball just be a drunk guy.  Maybe take your shirt off.
