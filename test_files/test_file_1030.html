    So I used to live with two people, my brother and some random chick. My brother moved out and got his mail redirected to his new address. The chick is getting her mail and packages fine. I'm not. My brother says he hasn't gotten any of my stuff. An amazon delivery via DHL said an adapter I bought was out for delivery on the 13th or 14th or something. I bought drugs, first class, extra stealth, Last Monday and they really shouldn't have been anything to have tripped off the dogs. Here I am again today with no packages. I called the post office help desk and they assured me nothing was being rerouted. Even went to the post office to see if anything was being held for me. The lady looked in the back and said no.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What could be going on, if anything? I don't think anyone caught me, otherwise I would have gotten my adapter. Just bad luck?

    So with a little investigation, this seems to be happening. The mailman is mysteriously not putting the package in my mailbox or on my porch (though after I complained no one was delivering any packages to me there has been packages on the porch to my roomie) and claiming to have left me a notice of attempted (not onlynever happened, I've lived at this residence for over a decade, why the fuck would they suddenly stop leaving my packages for me now?). When I go to the post office to see if they're holding any packages for me, they say they don't. But tracking info is telling a different story.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what is going on? I'm seriously pissed here.

    Problem may have something to do with the fact that my brother wasn't getting all his mail and rather than have me pass them off to him or something, he decided he'd have ALL mail with out last name sent to him. And he did this without my consent. And the post office let him. WTF? Let's hope he doesn't open any of my mail.
