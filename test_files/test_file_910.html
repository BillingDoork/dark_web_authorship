     OTTAWA — A Canadian warship has made a major drug bust at sea.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Department of National Defence says the HMCS Toronto has seized around 500 kilograms of heroin from a boat in the Indian Ocean.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The drugs were found after a naval boarding party searched the vessel as part of a security operation this past Friday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “During this inspection, the boarding team recovered approximately 500 kilograms of heroin with an estimated street value of more than $100 million,” the defence department said in a release Sunday. “The narcotics were confiscated without incident and will be destroyed.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “HMCS Toronto has recovered one of the largest heroin seizures on the high seas,” Defence Minister Peter MacKay said in the release. “This massive narcotics seizure is one example of how our Canadian Armed Forces members deployed in Canada and around the world are making a difference in international security and stability by denying criminals, and possibly terrorists, their source of funding.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HMCS Toronto’s commanding officer says it is one of the largest heroin seizures in a maritime environment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Commander David Patchell says the bust doesn’t just keep drugs off the street but also affects the finances of international terrorist organizations.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “This seizure will have a sweeping impact on these organizations at all levels and demonstrates Canada’s commitment to our allies and to ensuring the seas are used for legitimate purposes,” Patchell said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This massive narcotics seizure is one example of how our Canadian Armed Forces members deployed in Canada and around the world are making a difference
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The HMCS Toronto is currently part of a international naval task force patrolling the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean.

    I did some math.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    500 kilgorams siezed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police say its worth $100 million.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was sold at 1gram each (I know this never happens).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tomorrowman (Canada) sells 1G for ฿2.52 which were can translate to $250
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The total street value would be $250 x 500000g = $125,000,000
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So their estimate wasn't far off. Although using 1g is a bit silly.

    When they say street value sometimes they actually work it out wholesale value instead, but there is a few factors such as purity and destination country ofcourse. For both cocaine and heroin it's possible to turn that 500kg into much more, so that $250 dollar gram might not exactly be worth $250 if you catch my drift.

    Congrats to the motherfucking war on drugs, great work guys.  Now, we all can...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.  Pay more in taxes to fund more ships busting people at sea
    <br/>
    2.  Pay more in taxes for the government to destroy these drugs
    <br/>
    3.  Sleep easy at night knowing that the people in charge of a WARSHIP decided to go after $$$ rather than keep the peace
    <br/>
    4.  Pay more to the gangs and distributors for heroin
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah, great job Canada!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Jesus fucking Christ, have some balls and stand up the US pushing their war on drugs agenda on your country.

    ok fine. but please finalize when you get the product! its hard for me to have so many 500 kilo orders out there at once and everyone keeps waiting for it to auto finalize. I really nees the bitcoins so i can pick up another 5000 keys.

    This is your  last reship. If it doesnt make it, theres probably something wrong with your address :)
