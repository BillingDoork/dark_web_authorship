    Hello all, will be first time buying on silk road. I have a question, however.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Theoretically, would it be safe to receive 1-2 oxys in the mail at my college dorm?(no access to PO box) I go to a large university in the US with about 30,000 undergrads. I plan to order from a domestic source.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?

    Why would you compromise your whole college career? Please don't do this.

    Call a friend who lives off campus.

    It's not particularly risky. I moved out of the dorms by the time SR came around, so I've never done it, but I don't see much of a difference between shipping to a dorm and shipping to an apartment mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, bear in mind that if you're shipping to an address, as long as you keep your trap shut, there's always the plausible deniability of "I don't know why someone else is sending me drugs!" If you've ever gotten an underage drinking ticket in college, though, you'd know that the campus housing 'legal system' isn't bound by the whole 'innocent before proven guilty' thing, and they can and will throw you out of the dorms for even being the type of person that even unknowingly receives drugs in the mail, and possibly out of the university.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's up to you.

    There is no need to order to the college. Get a $25-$30 personal mailbox and do it there.
    <br/>
    You wouldnt order to your workplace, why order to your school ? It jeopardizes everything.
