    I have been on the road for awhile now, and it seems I am spending more and more and more on here. Its not my consumption, its the quality and price of getting shit from SR. If I go out with some bomb mdma or some euro whip, my friends might have a bit, then next week they ask for more, and then more people want it..Its spiraling out of control...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im not looking to be a dealer...I just want to hook my friends up so we can all enjoy it together and instead of having packages arrive every week I would much rather just order bulk every once in a while. Do vendors only ship envelopes when doing large orders because I don't want anything that will have to be hand delivered or picked up at the post office because of the drop im using. Do they split them up or whats the go? I just don't like the idea of having a big ass box that contains 100 grams of something delivered. I would much rather have 3 separate envelopes arrive at 3 separate drops...Can someone point me in the right direction and if its sensitive info, shoot me a pm or something...?

    In the same boat bro. Discuss with vendor. They ususly split orders and send to different adresses for swift delivery. Or same add over longer time scale.

    Talk to your vendor, I am sure he would not mind sending envelopes rather than tracking if  you have good history with him.  Either way if you don't want to become a dealer you probably shouldn't, learn to say no!  Remember IRL dealers are way more likely to get caught than SR vendors.
