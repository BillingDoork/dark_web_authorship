    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am thinking about placing a few large orders from the states and Canada. It's all hash and weed but was wondering on what the penalty was if caught bringing into UK.
    <br/>
    Has anyone been busted bringing in a few oz of weed who can shed some light on this for me?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no previous and never any custom letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance.

    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am a new vendor from Canada , I do not have any listings yet as I am waiting on proper packaging materials to arrive. They should be here within one or two weeks, do not listen to people who claim that vacuum sealing with regular ziplock bags is fine, by the time the package gets overseas they will be STINKING, at least to a dog's nose. You really need heavy duty packaging to ensure that if a big order passes by a dog that it will go undetected, however it is statistically quite unlikely your package will be near one fortunately. If you are worried about the police, then I would suggest getting something that you do not have to sign for, and leaving the package inside UNOPENED for 24hours, because if they bust in they can't really say you knew what was inside !

    Vlad is correct.

    There is a show on TLC in Canada called "Border Security" that profile the Vancouver airport/border/customs points.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the last episode, a package was sniffed out by a dog containin marijuana. It was double vacuum sealed ... so that didnt deter the dog.

    I saw that episode. As has been pointed out elsewhere, the outside MUST be very clean as well. InÂ  that episode, they were specifically looking at all mail to a particular destination (Ireland). In the same episode. there was very well sealed heroin package which did not have any smell on the outside, they tested it
