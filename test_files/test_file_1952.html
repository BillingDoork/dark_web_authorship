    Well far as I know, L is odourless or undetectable by dogs due to the size of the dose ie. ug.

    As far as shipping liquids and whether they get espescially flagged, I'm not sure.

    You should be fine, I've gotten large amounts of liquids (both legal and illegal) before with no problem. If you're in Europe, order from Europe. If you're in the USA, order from the USA. If you're somewhere else, it doesn't matter too much. Unless it's somewhere like Canada, then I'd stick to the USA.

    I would not worry about UK customs at all its one of the easiest countrys to get product into and like said above LSD is odourless, a dog cant smell it and even if they opened the package i highly doubt they will even think twice about it being LSD.

    Don't ship liquids. I have lost count of how many times I've said this. This is because liquids are a reason to believe it could be a mail bomb, which comes reason to do anything to your package. Suspected package + then the detection of liquid = guaranteed interception. Postal inspectors have machines for detecting liquids in the post, and they are like 100% effective at what they do, but I don't know much else about them.

    <br/>
    LSD blotter on the other hand you don't even need to vacuum pack. Hell, you could have an box of A4 worth of LSD and it'd fly straight through (not advising that though, lol). LSD has the lowest particulate transmission rate of any common illegal drug because ~150 micrograms is a really tiny amount.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In fact, I cannot think of a better product to transact on the silk road in terms of security/risk tradeoff. Profit is another thing, but having your own LSD lab would be a veritable gold mine. You'd be laughing all the way to the bank and then they'd be like: "lol, I need to see some ID for all this giant pile of money, lol" and you'd be like "lol no dude, lol, I own all the banks as well, lol".

    The lab itself would cost tens of thousands of dollars to make LSD for personal use, mass manufacture would require thousands upon thousands of rare, expensive, dangerous lab equipment and glassware... Just thinking about it is making me nerd out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And the synthesis for LSD... goddam it is beautiful. And complex. And dangerous as hell if done even slightly incorrectly. But it's so beautiful.

    There's ongoing efforts all the time, as you'd expect when something is at least 30k a gram (that's right folks, some wannabe Walter White might think he's a total badass at ~100k per kg street value, but an LSD manufacturer operating at the same level of output would be bringing down 30 million dollars :o , obviously production would typically be nowhere near a kg per month, more like a couple of grams, but still! The mind boggles!), but the main problem with LSD production has always been centralization. It is non-trivial to produce but if you do so you can absorb a large percentage of world market share very quickly due to the lack of competition. If you look at things like operation Julie in Wales, or more recently the lab operating in an Atlas missile silo in Kansas (genius idea I have to admit, even if that connection fucked him in the end), it was always easy to boost production from nothing to incredible amounts and dominate the market as a result. Problem is that is not the way to go, decentralization and swarming is a better idea, but for that you have to simplify the entire synthesis A-Z to achieve that just for a chemist of normal ability and experience, which is what a bunch of people are working on. I'm not an expert in LSD, but there surely can't be more than 10 or 20 serious clandestine labs in the world? Anyway, somebody was saying that the synth can be simplified hugely, and that small scale production will be possible in the future, but we'll have to wait and see.

    It's by far the most difficult synthesis for any illegal drug, and still one of the most complex syntheses for known to man. That, combined with the equipment alone costing more than your average Ferarri, makes it pretty unlikely that we'll ever see larger amounts of smaller labs, no matter how simplified the synthesis becomes. But there are definitely steps being taken to simplify it, but unfortunately no real progress has been made

    What? Synthesis of LSD in the last 20 years has been drastically simplified, it still requires inert environments and equipment that your average person wont have. It also requires time, which makes it hard to keep under the radar at a normal lab unless you have complete control. Really if you have access to the place to do it and the precursors, did ok in organic chem, after a few trial runs you should  be able to produce.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way pickard was said to be producing a kilo every 5 weeks, selling it for $2950 per gram. No smart lab produces a gram at a time, its way too risky, they produce it in batches, then slowly leak the crystal out over time, if its stored properly it won't degrade.

    Yes, it's been simplified, I worded my response a little oddly. I didn't mean it hadn't been simplified very much, just that it hadn't been simplified enough to be made by someone of a lesser skill level in terms of chemistry. It still requires essentially the same amount of skill and knowledge as before, so the same people are still making it. Sorry if that was confusing, my fault.

    Great posts, always liked what DoS has posted, but nowhere does it say he made LSD in his kitchen. He actually mentions utilizing what was most likely a dedicated, climate controlled dark room, as well as another room for drying some of the product. Definitely not done in a kitchen.

    Although this is a great post, I'd seen the first two but not the last one. +1 for that mate.

    How about casey hardison? Probably one of the easiest synths available today, far safer then POCl3, and easier to obtain.

     The lab itself would cost tens of thousands of dollars to make LSD for personal use, mass manufacture would require thousands upon thousands of rare, expensive, dangerous lab equipment and glassware... Just thinking about it is making me nerd out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And the synthesis for LSD... goddam it is beautiful. And complex. And dangerous as hell if done even slightly incorrectly. But it's so beautiful.

    I don't usually argue, and I'm not calling you out, and I know this is about shipping (so please don't down karma me), but being a O chem student, I can tell you for one that the actual making of the lysergic isn't that difficult - well it is, but not non-doable with a chem degree by any means, actually many say synthetic mescaline is much harder. But they do sell ET ergotamine tartratre, a necessary precursor on the SR, so with some glassware, and an inert atmosphere, one could be making LSD relatively easily given the right environment and know how!

    I for one am glad that bottles of lsd aren't freely available. My 2 cents worth!
