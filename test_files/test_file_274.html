    Getting a good amount of felonies worth of bud sent to me, it was shipped monday and supposed to be here wednesday but it's yet to arrive. On the usps site, it's marked as "acceptance" (as usual) and still @ the same facility. It has made no progress since the first update (which was the only update, the one that shows you that it's been accepted @ the usps place) and I'm worried about it. Should I be expecting the worse? Sent to a PO Box btw, any help would be appreciated.

    You really need to do all the reading you can on what a controlled delivery is, precisely why you must never even deny anything to the police let alone talk to them, and just how you REALLY get out of this -- not how people SAY you do.  It isn't as simple as "oh, but that isn't mine, go away now silly!"  Some people seem to think it's something like that... it isn't.  Short version: if you have any suspicion it's a controlled delivery, DO NOT pick it up.  Period.  Don't go in, don't give in to your want for your drugs, pretend the fucking thing never existed to begin with.  Maybe a week later, sure, if you think it's safe. Go pick it up.  If it was a controlled delivery, it won't be there.  If they want you bad enough, they'll come get you anyway and try to make you confess (they're very, VERY good at this -- do not talk.  Period.)

    ... and that's actually all that's coming to mind, but I've been awake for awhile here... somebody else fill in what I'm missing, because I know I didn't spend like a week and a half studying for one paragraph, lol...

    Thanks for the quick reply, I've already read all of that and if it happens I'm not even talking to them, period. I didn't think they could pick me up and ask me shit, only a judge/da could do that?
    <br/>

    Just paranoid because this is the longest a package has taken to get to me. It's normally 3 days but somethings weird about it this time.

    That's what I was hoping. It's a regular usps box, so I'm thinking maybe I should go in and get one of the same size and come out the PO Booking it just for a test lol

    Oh, Christ, I didn't even think to ask.  Is this a tracked express package, or a priority sort of thing with a DCN?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A DCN is not a tracking number.  Sometimes it won't even show up in the system until after it was delivered.  Seriously, it's incredibly hit-or-miss.  If it's just DCN, no worries, that happens.  If it's express... yeah, that's bad.

    Yeah I'm just hoping its "lost" in the post office. Don't really know though, I got my big order from another buddy in a different state, got here on time and it was sent last Friday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Both of them were out of equally big cities. Most of the time it will get to the sorting facility in a day and this one didn't even make it there.

    Er, to be explicit: Express Shipping (domestic) is the USPS 1-2 day overnight option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Priority is the standard 2-3 day shipping option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only express shipping has tracking.  Priority you can pay a little extra and get a DCN, a delivery confirmation number.  That is not a tracking number, it's updated unreliably and is only to be relied upon to prove delivery of the package, not route or arrival times.  Sometimes it really doesn't even exist until it gets put in after delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Express International, is yet a third thing.  Which is its own beast, and is not to be confused with USPS Express domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So.  Priority?  Relax, it's a DCN.  No worries.
