    I just wanted to ask a generic question of people that have gotten stuff sent from Canada with express shipping to the USA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What was the average delivery time; 3 days?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm trying to get a feel, so I can my order accordingly.  I've read that nothing moves on Saturday in Canada also, so...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    There is lots of express methods to ship with ... are you talking CP, Fedex, UPS ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CP for instance has Xpresspost ( 2-4 days signature required ) and Expedited ( 4-6 days no signature )

    2-3 days for me as I also am on the East Coast. I wanted to add that you will have to sign for it. I have done this before and it was fine, just dont go in there looking nervous since it raises suspicion.

    Because USPS is a joke. I sent two packages once, one express and one priority and the priority got there first. What happened to express being overnight?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm just going to start personally delivering my packages to you guys on my big RV with the American flag splashed on the side.

    recent batch ... all identical sized boxes ... to USA
    <br/>
    <br/>
    small packet air ( $8, got a DCN but it doesnt work on either usps or cp lol ) - 5 days delivered
    <br/>
    expedited ( $23, tracking number usually with 5 or 6 updates ) - 1 was 7 days delivered
    <br/>
    xpresspost ( $36, tracking number thats pretty close to live ) - 1 was delivered yesterday after 12 days
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i like tracking numbers for my own protection against receiver claims but honestly being private now and trusting everyone I work with, there is truly no value in it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    used to be that the speed of xpresspost offset the risks of signing for packages, but no longer is that the case. and IMO expedited is just a giant fucking ripoff, always has been but the tracking number is the reason people get it.

    I'm not sure, the sellers to specifically say in their profiles that I'm looking at.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the signature required deliveries, will the postman come to your door to have you sign, or do they typically leave a note in the mailbox, and you pick up the PKG at the post office?

    They'll come to your door and ask you to sign; in this case they don't require ID; anyone there can sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If no one is there, then they leave a note, and you have to go pick it up, and they'll require photo id.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's no option for re-delivery, they only try once then you have to pick it up.

    I've had a few Xpresspost packages sent to the west coast of the US from eastern CAD... it was usually a 2 day wait, once it was 3 days. Currently waiting on an order that already crossed the border in the first 24 hours, should be here by tomorrow or monday at latest (not sure if they'll do saturday delivery).
