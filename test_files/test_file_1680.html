    Yesterday I went into the post office and asked for some of the "400" labels (I've done this with no problem on a few other occasions), and was told, "We can't give those out anymore.  They only give us a few, and now we're supposed to put one on every package.  They only told us about that a couple of days ago".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got the lady to give me the handful that I needed, but now I'm not sure what to do.  I figured I'd try another post office...but what then?  If they give them to me, what does that mean about the local PO?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has this happened to anybody else?  Any thoughts?

    If you ship more then 5 packages a week, post office trolling won't cut it. Really the only choice is use a prepaid debit card and get some 400 labels sent someplace you can pickup but you're not connected to.

    I had the same problem. My solution was using a friend to go to another post office (after being declined from 2) and he made up some sob story how he needed to ship his deceased relatives possessions to pay the bills. haha.

    Yep, this is true(ish). Almost all the PO's are not giving them out, but they all give different "reasons". I don't think they even really know why they can't, they are just making up reasons that sound good so the customers don't get so pissed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered some tracking labels from a highly rated vendor, so I'm set. Ordered 100 and he threw in an extra 50!

    Really, you are going to buy tracking labels off a black market and have them sent to you? Not only is there a chance that if someones package gets flagged from one of the rolls this guy is selling that the whole tracking range will get flagged but you are a vendor giving out a drop address to an unknown person. Hey less competition for the rest of us.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP there is two solutions to the tracking issue and none of them involve begging. You either acquire your tracking labels online anonymously or you do without tracking and write in your policy that buyer accepts full risk of mail system. Anyone whose using tracking labels at this point deserves to get canned.

    Geez I hope no one buys tracking labels from a black market where you could be buying it off a cop. Sounds sketchy at best to me. You'd be safer to just order them for free from stamps.com or usps and have em sent to a anon drop if possible.

    Just use the click 'n ship commercial base pricing, so it'll look like a business. Generate the label and instead of paying for it thru the website, just print the label with the tracking number included and throw some priority stamps on it. Done.

    Pretty much everything in the USPS has some kind of stamp on it. If you take a priority or express envelope up to the counter at a post office they charge you for the postage, and then put the correct stamp on it. They're not just for throwing things in blue boxes without going inside. I really don't see any employee noticing or caring about that method beyond whether or not the item has correct paid postage. I am sure there are other people doing the same thing and not shipping drugs, there must be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And anytime I go into the post office I see all kinds of regular looking people shipping all kinds of things and boxes/mailers. Most are packaged very shoddily. So imo, if your illicit packages look markedly more professionally than the average, everything should be fine. The printed label, even weight distribution, no bulging, not excessively or oddly taped will all make the parcel seem like a legit package. Not something someone just threw together quickly to get out the door, which is what I see most individuals at the post office doing.

    I know it works. There is also a nice feature with the click 'n ship where you can select 'shipping from different zip code than return address' which could come in handy, though I personally wouldn't use it just to not add another maybe "weird" parameter making for a second look. I don't use TOR on government websites like USPS.com, never tried really. Try "wardriving" using an unsecured wifi from some random house/apt building. But I mean c'mon dude, are you really that lazy that you can't just go out to a hotspot at starbucks or McDonald's or wherever, and switch 'em up for security's sake. I am not that tech savvy so I wouldn't know about another safe way outside of TOR for "spoofing" your IP so it can't be traced back to you.

    had a chance to look through the process again, you have to input some sort of payment info before clicknship will give you a label. this is obvious as they dont want people mistakenly sending unpaid labels through the system. but hey you know it works right so we should believe everything you say from now on.

      I know it works.

I don't use TOR on government websites like USPS.com, never tried really. Try "wardriving" using an unsecured wifi from some random house/apt building.

     had a chance to look through the process again, you have to input some sort of payment info before clicknship will give you a label. this is obvious as they dont want people mistakenly sending unpaid labels through the system. but hey you know it works right so we should believe everything you say from now on.

    Watch, how? Most SR buyers don't use the forums or even know they exist. Particularly ones that would be dumb enough to FE at all, and with a new vendor like yourself. You have been actively trolling these forums, in some vain attempt to get your name out there? So what? You'll have some chance of drudging up credibility to continue ripping people off? I am done with this.
