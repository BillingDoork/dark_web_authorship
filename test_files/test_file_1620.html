    I know from personal experience that psilocybe cubensis is not trained into dogs. I have seen others say that LSD gives no odor and is not detectable by a dog. What other drugs or chemicals are not detectable by dogs? What drugs are not trained into dogs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suspect that they primarily are just trained for pot opioids and cocaine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will try to maintain a list here. You should by no means consider it safe to ship these items that are not detectable or not trained in an open packaging only less of a risk to be detected.

    I would suspect that due to the number of strains it is either impractical or not possible to train them for the scent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Without going into detail. All I know for sure is that the dog was told to search on the baggie several times which contained home grown and not once did the dog signal on it.

     That is a myth. Dogs can detect LSD; they just aren't usually trained to do so.

    You need heat sealed MBB's. Vac seal is outdated brotha

    Is it true that dogs can only be trained to search for certain things like eg. K-9#1 is trained for cannabis and cocaine K-9#2 is trained for cocaine and heroin etc, etc...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I read an article about trining dogs like they scent their favorite toy with weed then get them to search for the ball...In turn that dogs now recognizes weed scent as the target... How would they train a dog to search for multiple different things?

    Yes! But there is often a huge different between the dogs!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because i had two situation long time ago!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One was in my flat, 4 officers and one searching drug dog was also here! He found nothing but i had at this time 3 different kind of drugs in my flat, and not vacuum sealed or something like that! And the 3 substances are all in the list!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And i also had a situation where i was not at home, i was sitting near to a friend, and the same happens to him! and he only had 0,1 gram hash very hidden, really good hidden! And the dog smelled it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And a dog can't work longer than 20 minutes of searching drugs in parcel or suitcases from costums or police or whatever!!!
    <br/>
    After 20-30 min of searching things a dog is out of power and have to make a break, so often costum on airport takes two drug dogs ,a active and a passive drug dog!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be safe!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DogsÂ  can't smell vacuum packages,but if the vendor touch the letter or something, the dog could maybe smell it! But the i think 80 percent of good vendors use gloves and make it sure that you get what you want!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If somebody want more information about drug dogs pm me, i have trained over 10 years dogs so i have also 2years knowledge from this special "police" dogsÂ  :D :D :D

    I think the general rule of thumb is that you should expect all narcotics animals to smell most of these four:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1)Marijuana
    <br/>
    2)Cocaine
    <br/>
    3)Opiods
    <br/>
    4)Amphetamines (Meth, speed paste)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and I try to assume that a lot of dogs are trained to smell MDMA specifically, and generally do have some sort of training for phenethylamines. I have no clue if this is true, but considering the popularity of molly, and the slew of newer phenethyls that flow throughout the club culture, it's safe to assume that these need MBB packaging as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Things I do not worry about dogs smelling are
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LSD
    <br/>
    DMT
    <br/>
    Mushrooms
    <br/>
    2C's
    <br/>
    Ketamine/DXM/MXE
    <br/>
    (basically ANY reserach chemical that isn't a phenethylamine)
    <br/>
    Barbiturates
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know this isn't remotely scientifically or factually accurate, but considering the types of drugs, the popularity, etc, this mock-up list is how i've always risk-assessed both ordering silkroad drugs and keeping them on my person or in my house or car. Logically, this list makes sense, and logistically dogs will not be trained to smell obscure drugs like research chemicals and most hallucinogens. There just isn't enough widespread abuse or drug-related gang violence to justify spending millions of dollars nationwide (US) to train a shitload of animals to spot these less popular drugs. And how would you possibly make efficient use of dogs trained to smell obscure drugs? It's a worthless waste of time from any way you look at it. Drug dogs are spread so thin already that the only sensible way to make use of them is to smell for the main four types of drug that constitute probably 85-90% of all drugs trading hands in the country. No LE agency or lawmaker is going to even bat an eye at some college kids who are trading 2C-E in their small friend group. Or Ketamine at music fesivals for that matter. Ket for example, is a schedule 3 drug, and any of it's analogues (MXE currently) aren't even legally bound to the analog act (only sched 1 and 2 drugs are covered).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So by the time you get conclusive data to tell us PROBABLY what the MAJORITY of drug dogs are trained to detect, you would have already done enough research to find a top notch vendor using MBB packaging and almost completely mitigated all risk of getting caught ordering drugs in the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Interested thread to an extent, but a waste of time.

    Dogs can smell just about anything if trained to. They have even trained them to smell money as they smell the type of ink used.
    <br/>
    They are trained to smell the safrole used in MDMA.
    <br/>
    There is a sample smell made by Sigma Aldrich that police use to train dogs to find LSD (Sigma Pseudoâ¢ Narcotic Scent LSD formulation). A lot of people will proclaim that LSD is odorless, well not to a dog.

    2C-X is a phenethylamine. And LSD is not tasteless. Unless you eat straight crystal, you won't taste it really. Look up what Shulgin (scientific) and ChinaCat72 (anecdotal) have to say on the matter. Allegedly a thumbprint tastes like having a metal spoon in your mouth. Dogs would likely only be able to detect bulk if it even has a smell.

    And I could easily see that company selling the LSD "smell alike" chemical as complete BS. Cops wouldn't think twice about that and just buy it.

    Does anyone have any information about detection dogs and mephedrone or other cathinones and if they're trained to find mephedrone would they be able to find other cathinones like 4-mec 3-mmc 3-emc or would they each have distinct smells so they all require training.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also does anyone know if they're likely to be trained to find benzos like xanax, thanks in advance.

     I know from personal experience that psilocybe cubensis is not trained into dogs. I have seen others say that LSD gives no odor and is not detectable by a dog. What other drugs or chemicals are not detectable by dogs? What drugs are not trained into dogs?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I suspect that they primarily are just trained for pot opioids and cocaine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I will try to maintain a list here. You should by no means consider it safe to ship these items that are not detectable or not trained in an open packaging only less of a risk to be detected.

    From everything i have gathered after reading a ton of threads, it appears that dogs are primarily trained to find cannabis, cocaine, meth, opioids, and masking agents such as coffee beans
