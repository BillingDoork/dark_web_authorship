    This hasn't happened to me so no need to panic.

    It's said that anyone can send anything to anyone in the post, it has to be proven it's for you to to actually be prosecuted?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just sitting in my room and it popped in to my head can you really get done if you did sign for a package with the contents of it being drugs? I don't know about anyone else but if I wasn't expecting a package and didn't know the contents of it but the postman came to the door or I had to go to the post office to sign for it I'd still sign for it even though I wasn't expecting it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't see how they could convict you even though you're just signing for a package that's addressed to you! It's not like the letter is see through..

    Even if the criminality of signing it comes into question, controlled deliveries will often wait before entering the premises--after delivery--in hopes that the suspect opens the package (or an accomplice rolls by). They then have solid possession charges and, more likely than not, additional charges for whatever's laying around your house. "I didn't know" is an incredibly frail and cliché defense.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just don't sign for it. Don't risk your life for a couple dollars. If you're suspicious, turn it down.

    The Controlled Delivery just validates their warrant to search the residence. If they dont find any drugs or paraphernalia and the person that signed for the package has not opened the package then it would be very difficult for the prosecution to make the charges stick. But this combination of factors rarely happens if ever. Your best bet is to just not sign for packages that you know do not require a signature.

    this. you should be grateful that they give themselves away by asking you to sign for shit and simply turn it down. if a neighbor you never saw before says that your mail was delivered to them and asks you to take it from them, deny that also, that is a trick they have used in some CDs.

    just FYI, LE has a great deal of leeway in how they conduct a controlled delivery.
    <br/>
    They DO NOT have to get a signature unless the conditional warrant requires it.
    <br/>
    There's no law or legal precedent that says you must sign first. That bit will be entirely up to the judge and whether he'll sign the warrant or not.  They also have the option of having your regular carrier drop it in your box and then waiting &amp; watching.  Or in the case of a PO box where you don't pick it up right away replacing it with a stimulant and collecting video/photo evidence instead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are many many many cases of controlled deliveries occurring where agents merely monitor the package remotely (visually or via camera) and bust down the door once you pick it up.
    <br/>

    A lot of reports online in the bodybuilders forums (steroids).  Read up.

    I don't doubt what anyone has said, but it seems unfair that signing and opening an unsolicited package can be counted against you.... I would definitely sign for and immediately open an unexpected package out of curiosity! ( well I wouldn't now obviously!)
    <br/>
    I suppose it's a case of that on its own could never convict you but once they search and find paraphernalia and also evidence on computer they'd have you.
