    If you've been around the Darkweb for a while you should have heard of the information floating around about the biological weapon terrorist are going to unleash at the olympics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not trying to scare anyone, but there were a few other terrorist attacks in various parts of the world in the past several years that were rumored on .onion sites days/months before they happened. This news never makes it to the media because a lot of this shit isn't even done by terrorist, but by their own governments inciting fear into the populous to control the population and more easily pass 'anti-terrorism' laws, aka, laws that take away your freedoms to keep you 'safer'. These are called False Flag attacks and there are many of them all throughout history. Germany did one back in WW2 to have a reason to attack, and it's highly rumored 9/11 was one by the US government in the light of all these 'anti-terorrism' laws they've passed lately. Aka, all the ones that have taken our freedoms and privacies away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, it doesn't matter who did these attacks, but be very careful about going to large world wide gatherings such as the olympics. Lucky the powers that be aren't so secretive and this information often leaks onto the darkweb before it happens.

    Germany definitely did a black flag/false flag operation in WWII actual, multiple if I'm not mistaken.. US had operation northwoods declasified (scary) but I don't think the US Goverment is organized to pull 9/11 with no whistle blowers just acusers....StonedCrusader, can you PM Me some darknet links to where you're reading this? I've got a damn curious mind I need to satisfy.

    im staying well clear of london during the Olympics, its a terrorist attack waiting to happen, the no good cunts are going to do something at some point in time as revenge for killing bin larden, in the same way he was killed for his part in 9/11, the world has gone mad, i mean what sort of fucked up person does something like 9/11 and kills so many innocent people, and sadly its only a matter of time before something else happens, all this time and money both the US and UK have spent and all the young solders lifes lost trying to help them sort there country out, it makes me sick, we would have been better off evacuating the men, women and children and just drop a nuke on the remaining talaban and alkieda (cant spell that) it would have been cheaper and not half as many of our solders lifes would have been lost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what does make me angry is how our governments (both UK and US) can stand back and send our men to there deaths, it makes my blood boil, sorry a bit of topic there
    <br/>
    <br/>
    back to royal fucking hell, they are useless i have been waiting 5 orders 3 of witch are domestic orders all week and this is first class, can someone explain what the extra money they are making from there price rise is actually doing? cos it just seems like they have gotten worse since they put there prices up, so im now paying more money for a worse service, orders i have sent out have not arrived so all my money is sitting in escrow, so now i have no stock  and cant re-up, looks like im going to have to bankroll my silkroad business out of my living money again because royal hell cant pull there fingers out of there arses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sorry for the rant, im in a right shit mood as got killer tooth ache and its a wisdom tooth (mega painful) ive even started taking my own stock to reduce pain but its hopeless  :'(

    Not to be so presumptuous as to suggest you've got it all wrong, RR, but Al'Quaeda evolved out of the Mujahadeen which were set up and funded by the US gov't. 'Al'Quaeda' itself is not a name of a terrorist organisation, but of the CIA database that contained the names of suspected terrorists. World events like 911 and 7/7 were without a doubt contrived by the powers that be to further the agenda of sending military to the east, which is in the name of 'pre-emptive' attack, war for peace. No doubt the coming false flag attack at the olympics will be the justification for destroying Iran

    Nothing's going to happen during the Olympics in London. The Olympic park is separated from the rest of London by a huge swamp and a shit hole called Hackney which helps. Every London overground and underground station is now completely covered (over 100% coverage) with CCTV which can tell if you're blinking funny. It can monitor your body heat, your gait (way you walk) tell if you're carrying a bomb, plan to pickpocket, have already committed a crime and are trying to get away, it's clinically insane, you can't and won't be able to do anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every single person is followed on some London wide CCTV computer system which monitors your journey the whole route through London, from leaving your house or hotel at point A, to getting on a bus which is completely filled with CCTV at point B, to getting off and walking to point C, to getting on a train at point D to getting off a train at point E etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All major public areas including busy stations have special anti bomb detonation equipment (I don't know how this works) but you can try it out at Clapham Junction, try sending a text (you have to try several times), try using mobile internet (full 3G signal, yet no internet connection), try making a call (takes a min to connect).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's CCTV camera's built into the roads at various points normally under traffic lights, which film and take pictures of the underside of every single car which has to enter or leave the capital to check for suspicious things (you can see an example of them on the A40 on one of the major into London roads outside Paddington). There's also Customs &amp; Excise style scanning machines which use a variety of wavelengths to check for particularly dangerous materials inside vehicles on certain roads and you wouldn't even know you went past or over one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's countless other things, I could go on but you get the picture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Olympics has been a great excuse for the government in this country to employ a proper civilian lock down permanently.
