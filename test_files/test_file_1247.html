    Im receiving conflicting advice. I read farmerbob state that when you vacuum seal the molecules will expand outward which causes more likelyhood of detection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im hearing others state that you should seal the first bag, and then vac seal the 2nd and 3rd bags.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which is safer? And, do you need to use different sealers for each stage so there is no cross contamination
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, is it safe to put different local cities in your real fake return address labels? I live in a big city, but it seems that if I continuously put MY city in the return address its going to point a finger. Of course, if I drop my packages within my city only (its really big.) I understand that will also create a pattern.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts? Advice?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    I can't offer any advice on the vac sealing however, I do know that if the return address zip code does not match the zip code that it was sent from and is different from the zip code of the packages that usually go through that specific sorting center, it is a big red flag.

    Vacuum sealing, unless punctured, will not make something be more detectable. Using vacuum sealing, while still detectable after a set time, is better then nothing at all. Usually I used vacuum sealing to make the item smaller and more compact. To be hidden. It also helped to preserve shelf life of certain products.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vacuum seal, then wipe down the bag. If domestic to domestic you will be fine. Going overseas is a whole different nightmare altogether.

    MBB is really where you need to head.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm having a debate right now on combination methods...I personally bag first, then MBB then vac seal inside a plastic - the MBB seals entirely and the vac following compresses the product gently - so to me you get the best of both worlds...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my style at the moment, if it helps I hope so...but still experimenting to get the perfect package!! ;)

    Hey bud,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We've found that vaccum sealing isn't NEARLY as important as people think it is. Dog's will smell right through the seal unless there are many layers and industrial vaccum packaging material. Just use MBB's. Our method is a vac seal layer to keep the product in place and for the ease/comfort of our buyers who seem to like having it there. The MBB is crucial though, and will make or break your package if it is looked into further. It's easy to use and dirt cheap, there really is no reason not to use it.

    Vacuum sealing reduces pressure inside a container. Atmospheric pressure is now pushing against the outside surface of the container. Vac seal inside vac seal adds a layer of protection against atmospheric pressure. In this scenario, temperature is a bigger concern regarding odor, as higher temperatures (90-120 degF) will increase the pressure of the container and (most likely) expand the material of the container, increasing permeability. This results when packages are transferred on the tarmac under sunny conditions or via freight on the sunny interstate. When the vac seal package is stored in additional packaging at atmo pressure, then whatever happens to the inner containers, there is enough material to preserve its integrity--odor control--hence, MBB....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When shipping, one of the most critical steps is during packaging. HEPA filters and ultra clean conditions are matters of life and death--career and prison. If the initial handling of product is not done cleanly, then contaminants can be transferred to the OUTSIDE of the vac sealed bags: hand-to-hand contact, aerosols, tweezers, equipment, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example of safe handling (every room with a HEPA):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Room 1.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Product is prepared for shipment and transferred into primary container using 2 person method; hands-on person and bag-man. Bag man seals bag, cleans bag with solvent (e.g. isopropyl alcohol)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Room 2.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Product is vac sealed, etc. This room NEVER contains unpackaged product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping rooms should never allow smoking, eating, or drinking.
