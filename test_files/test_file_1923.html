    So I'd like to order a vaporizer, but as it turns out, I'm also completely dry. Would ordering the vape and some bud at the same be a bit too risky?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance.

    If they come from the same vendor packaged in the same box then yeah i'd be worried lol, otherwise yeah like the other guy said in an ever so politely way ... vaporizer's aren't illegal to buy and distribute throughout many places in the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm about to buy a vape myself, made a thread yesterday trying to get some advice (no volcano, no no :D), I think I decided on the Extreme Q cuz i can use bags or whips and it has a quality ceramic heater with triple sensors (but if it's garb. please someone tell me lol, I dun wanna waste my money).  Luckily there's a headshop closeby with about one of everything, so i'll be able to get it once I get the flow, but damn so much crap products/info to sift through !
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which vape have you decided on buying?  Or should I just assume you're buying a volcano? heh

    Ether: It's obviously not, but like many on SR, I'm hopelessly paranoid. I just thought that a vaporizer order might raise some red flags, since the majority of people that buy vaporizers are potheads.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Quinone: After much DuckDuckGoing and sifting through YouTube vaporizer reviews, I settled on the Extreme Q  :). Many blogs say it's the best whip-style vaporizer on the market, and I've always wanted a whip-style vape, hence my decision. Not to mention that it doesn't break the bank like the Volcano does, and unlike the Volcano, it's both a whip-style and balloon-fill vape, even though the Volcano is of course by far the best balloon-fill vape out there.

    legally, it's hot water. meaning: you won't get in legal trouble and shit if you do it, but you'll be watched for the rest of your life if you get caught. Your mail will be seized regularly, etc. But only if you get caught. But not everyone gets caught, that's the thing. Most people don't

    I shit you not, too much quantum mechanics is bad for your health.

    As a kitchen tool there is no issue with buying a vape, when it comes with a whip and other paraphernalia from which a case can be made that its being bought for illegal use (aka to get a warrant ... to open the vape box, which will just have a brand new vaporizer in it lol) then meh they may flag your account if you are the like 1 in a 10000 they catch/care about, but it will have no correlation whatsoever to a weed purchase from here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just wouldn't be worried.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    O and a piece of advice, instead of spending $10 a bag on replacement extreme q bags, buy volcano bags and put the glass piece on it yourself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think I might go get mine shortly, shoulda tonight but meh.

    If you can afford a Volcano, go for it, but personally I would recommend a Silver Surfer vape (mine was $300 something and they put a custom image on it, very bad ass) or a Magic Flight Box, which is a great little travel size vape and is only I think $120 or so.

    I loved my silver surfer back when I still smoked/vaped.  The unit itself was around $230 at a headshop, picked my color, picked the base color, picked some 'custom' glass for the knob and wand and stuff, came with a very nice hemp carrying case with pockets for the whip and mouthpieces, also bought the hands free attachment.  Have since quit smoking herb, but the vape itself still works like a pro (5 years later), I gave it to my sister for her birthday :D

    So I did go grab one, decided on Extreme Q and am very very glad I did.  This thing is badass and comes with so much extra shit, like fuck.

    But it's the whip/balloon duality that sold me on it.  Heats up fast (but I leave it and my herb for like 15 min just to get all the glass and herb equilibrated and it's smaller thankfully (then a volcano).

    For $220, i'm a happy camper, coulda bought 2 of these for the outrageous price of a volcano.

    The extreme Q looks like a good vape, a cross between a whip vape and a bag vape if I'm right?

    That was the first vape I ever had, loved my buddha. Ended up selling it on a spur of the moment type thing and regretted it, but happy when I found it's replacement in the silver surfer.

    Im Canadian, no way it would have cost me any less if I bought from e-bay, they would have charged me insane shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also liked the appeal of being able to drive 10 min and go get my vape.  Which for the record is great.

    Good times with my Extreme Q, I've owned it for years now and it's served me so well. It finally started breaking down and not heating up properly so I contacted the company that makes them (Arizer) and the owners are so chill, you know they're potheads. They sent me a new one first and then I sent the old one back, talk about customer service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can also buy the battery packs for it to make it portable, me and some good friends used to just take it to parties and vape people out with some good sativas, yup good times.

    Wow  the 'extreme q' sounds good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the Volcano is a wonder indeed bit a bit of a mess about filling up big bags - looks worse than rolling a joint!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had plenty of vapes from the first which were well made but basically jars with glass screw on tops and a heating element with a small holder for the herb. Still got my old Blue Meanie and some other one smaller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Used to enjoy scraping the vaped resin or tar off when short. Harsh but active!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not sure what to go for. Nearest city headshop has a vape for £30 or so. With a dial on to set heat. Chinese. Likely last a year and you will never get a bew one back or be able to clean a vape to send via Chinese customs.

    A simple glass pipe vape used by crackheads or meth is good for bud, hash or oil. not ideal but useful and mobile.

    I've also almost come to the conclusion saying fuck bags, I LOVE the whip.  What companies idea was it to fill bags in the first place, I mean a vape is structured just like a  hookah (cept with the ..everything being different), why not just suck the vape straight from a hose.  Hell, make a vaporizer with 4 hoses, that'd be boss ! lol
