    More than likely you probably just got ripped off
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you FE'd (finalized early) on both orders then consider your money gone. Unless you get your stuff or a miraculous refund - it's just money down the toilet. IF you one day do get your package then make note of the transaction and judge whether you would do it again and review accordingly. ...
