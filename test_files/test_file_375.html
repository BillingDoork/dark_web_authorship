    1. Placed an order with an extremely successful vendor 18 days ago (has been in transit for 17 days). Their stealth is apparently without peer. The product has not arrived although shipping times on their page say between 7-17 days for international deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Placed an order with a relatively new vendor (under 200 transactions) and it arrived within 7 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The second order was placed a few days after the first one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had been wondering if my address was flagged, until the second order arrived yesterday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I be worried about the first one not arriving or give it some more time?

    Yeah I'm telling myself that also but (as I'm sure most people know) the waiting fucking sucks especially when other orders have been so fast.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Having a look at their feedback other people have experienced 20+ days before it arrived. Seriously how can a package take that long to deliver? Being sent from Estonia or some shit?

    Customs can be finicky, sometimes it is out of there in days, others, it can sit there for 30 plus, it depends on how busy they are.

    Yeah but isn't it strange that one package (with only the barest of stealth techniques applied) got through real fast vs the other (super stealth) that hasn't shown up yet?
