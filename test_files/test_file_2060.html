    Ok I don't start a thread until searching for info on the forum first. I came up with insufficient info so I'm starting this ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The golden question is how significant is the difference in security between priority and express?
    <br/>
    This is in regards to say like an 8th of bud, nicely packaged...(US domestic)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know there are going to be mixed responses/opinions but I wanna hear them, I normally wouldn't think twice about having a package sent priority but these past few days I haven't been able to find any green locally and it's been frustrating to say the least...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be great if some vendors chimed in who have sent bud express, and whether or not they have always arrived safely and on time

    The majority of domestically shipped weed intercepts are Express mail packages.  Postal Inspectors vigorously profile incoming Express packages for contraband.  I don't know of a single experienced, reputable seller who ships Express.  Experienced buyers(by experienced  mean someone who's been around at least 5 yrs)I know would never consider receiving an Express packge that contains contraband.

    Depends if the dude behind the monitor has extensive shipping with express packages.  If you can conceal it well, it can be done.  For the totally inept, seizures will happen.

     Dude who the fuck gives a shit about an 1/8 expressed, I get a express weed shipment nearly once a week.

     As long as its smallish I wouldn't give any thought to it.

    Sands, you are making the common but somewhat dangerous assumption that Postal Inspectors..should they stumble upon one of your weekly weed shipments...would have no interest in trying to find out were  it came from and/or to whom it is addressed.  I sincerely hope you never  have to find out first hand just how wrong you are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping/receiving drugs in the mail by way of ANY class of mail(Priority, Express, 1st Class)is ALWAYS risky.  While it's true that the chances of your pkg safely getting though are very good,  that does not change the fact  that every single time you receive an illegal drug package you risk getting caught and prosecuted and sent to prison.  It's commonly accepted in most circles that Express mail increases your risk.  For those who wish to minimize their risk when playing dangerous games...avoid Express pkgs.  What's the rush anyway?  Another factor that  unnecessarily elevates one's risk is impatience.

    Express mail gets through all the time, but the majority of interceptions are express mail.

    Especially if it is international you want to avoid using fast shipping. Fast shipped international packages are put under much more scrutiny than slower shipped packages.
