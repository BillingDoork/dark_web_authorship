    So I was waiting for a delivery from USPS and a "friend" kinda knew about it, anyway this motherfucker calls me up and tells me I'm gonna be mad...he intercepted my mail 3 houses down from mine while I was home waiting. My mailman knows me, my house what I drive and my fucking ink,  I bought the house 4 years ago and have had the same mailman.  Friend tells me " I just told him that I was you and he just handed over all of your mail". WTF is that shit? He described my mailman to a T. Its not like I want to call the Post Office and and complain and as for my "friend", gave me some bullshit about he thought my gf would be mad and was doing me a favor.... I always get packages why the fuck would she care about this one SHE KNEW.  Needless to say I haven't seen or heard from him since I told him we needed to talk in person about this. Out of my "package" and btc and there goes my fucking Halloween party.  DON'T TRUST ANY GOVERNMENT RUN AGENCY. I hope this little dbag don't open any credit card accounts, I'm always getting the apps in the mail. Any ideas how to proceed with the USPS?

    Well I would start by discussing this with my friend...after the blood was mopped up I might causally make sure my mailman associated my name with my address and if my friend did have my package I would let it end there. If you confront the mailman he might just have your friend charged to cover his ass.

    He knows he has a ass kicking coming his way and he knew about the package because of my Halloween party, he was the only person that I trusted. I know now not to tell anyone anything else. I heard from a reliable source that his loudmouth fucking wife put him up to it, she and I dont really care for each other and I've told her the best thing he could do with his life is divorce her dumbass. I'm just shocked by how the mailman handed it over knowing that wasn't me. I could understand if he told the mm that he was picking my mail up or some shit but to just say " yep thats me" no idea check...wouldnt have worked anyway cause I use a alias but never the less didnt even ask.

    Fuck me.

    You first need to reevaluate your life.  No friend of mine would ever blatantly steal from me...and then tell me he stole from me.  Something don't smell right here.  You're an idiot if you told this person and trusted this person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for this "friend," I totally forgive him...if he lived.  In fact,  I wouldn't be posting about this because I would'nt want to give away potential evidence after I fucked his world up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this real life? Seriously.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: The only question you have is what to do about the postman? The problem is you and the people you blab you fat mouth to.  This site is predicated on people taking their personal security very seriously...

    I'm sorry dude but what the fuck were you thinking. NEVER tell ANYONE your receiving drugs in the mail, not even your girlfriend... thats just one more person who the cops can pressure to talk. What they don't know wont hurt them.

    At least you know where he lives. This should be an easy fix. Also, it sounded as if you used an alias? Then how would the postman know it's for you?

    Humans are the weak link to every operation. Sorry to hear about your package and a likely former 'friend'. If it was MDMA, We can have a package to you before Halloween no problem ;)

    P.S. As was mentioned, I wouldn't stress the Mailman too much. We're talking about a federal charge... he might be obligated to report it which isn't good for anyone.
