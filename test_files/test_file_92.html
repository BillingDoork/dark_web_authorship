    All right so we all know about metered postage. Problem is these things make it a lot harder to ship priority/express 100% anonymously, for a couple reasons. Now I'm not looking for advice on how to ship anonymously via using the meter. I know how. I am looking for a less time-consuming method for anonymous priority and express postage. Thus, I thought of a particular instance when I bought from a vendor, who will remain unnamed, that used actual $18.95 STAMPS, not the metered stickers with barcodes but actual STAMPS, like the forever ones. So my first question is, are 5.15 and 18.95 actual stamps still sold and, if so, where do I get them? Of course a PO would be a good place to start but I don't know if even they would have them, especially with the new meters put up. In fact, being that one of the main reasons the meters were put up in the first place was convenience, I doubt PO's are still carrying around big rolls of every kind of stamp anymore. So I'm wondering now if there's any particular places that people know for sure sell these kinds of stamps. I know they're special, but they must be out there if I'm seeing a vendor using them, unless they have recently been discontinued.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Side note: Also searched online - nothing to be found. Seems like the forever ones are the only kinds anyone buys.

    Your local PO should have at least the 5.15, 1.00, .65, and .10 stamps..... don't know about the 18.95 stamps, never had use for them.

    Yep, as others mentioned you can get them from an actual PO... They should be sold in any quantity you're looking for, people still use them all the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But, a workaround is to use the current Forever Stamp value of 45 cents and use 12 for SFR Priority box/envelope without DCN, and 14 with DCN. Yes, 14 stamps may seem ridiculous but I've seen more on both legal and illegal items received. Another advantage is that you don't have to go to a PO for them, all kinds of stores carry them.

    I'm aware of this but, like you said, 12-14 stamps? And jesus, doing it on an express vlope? No way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And all right, PO it is. I'll see what I can do. Thanks for the advice.
