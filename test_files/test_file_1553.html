    Hello ''Silki´s!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yesterday I made an order, and usually I encrypt the data with pgp.
    <br/>
    But anyhow (was thinking about something else...?) it happened that I sent it unencrypted, fu.k!!
    <br/>
    I tried to stop the transfer but it was already to late, it was sent!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anybody have experience in sending data unencrypted?
    <br/>
    Consequences?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I cancel any order to that adr?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for help!!

    You'll 99.9999% likely be absolutely fine. Your address will have been encrypted by the Tor system, and if we believe what we're told, SR has its own encryption and it'll be securely deleted once the seller marks your transaction as 'In Transit'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In future, don't get distracted!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT - this post is in no way meant to be an encouragement not to use PGP. To be clear - I think not using PGP for your sensitive information is completely insane.

    I personally think encrypting is extremely important! Your freedom is worth the extra trouble. I don't think though that one time messing up will cause you any problems. Just try to remember!

    I notice by the day that people send unencrypted messages with personal information, I think it must be stressed out more in this forum the importance of PGP, not that it already isn't but a lot of people don't seem to bothered about it and most likely don't understand the consequences, in any case should something happen.

    Not a huge deal IMO, just remember for next time =)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    99% of my customers do not encrypt their address unfortunately, and even worse some even PM me their address to confirm (followed my a solid scolding by me about the importance of PGP)

    PGP-ing your info is mostly a best practice and partially a last-ditch effort to keep it secure in the unlikely event that the SR services are compromised. Many, perhaps MOST vendors will tell you that buyers generally don't follow this best practice. Some vendors even get pissed if you DO encrypt your details. NO PGP FOR THE KING, amirite?

    The only time people encrypt is when they ask me if it worked, like that guy said 99% dont do it.

    Hi Silki´s!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your encouraging and uplifting posts are calming down my concerns, THANK YOU!!
    <br/>
    Even the vendor (one of the biggest on SR) did soothe my thoughts.
    <br/>
    Hope it is like you all say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SR community is really great, wouldn´t know what to do if it would not exist, THANK YOU ALL!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...and have a lot of fun with the items offered!!!
