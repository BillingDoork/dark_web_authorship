    I received two packages together and one of the packages was clearly empty. I checked the package and it had no signs that it was tampered with nor did it look resealed. I carefully opened the package and the seal/contact points didn't look like it was opened more than once (professional job?). There was nothing inside the package not even a note. Was the content removed by customs? If yes, why was there no note inside and no sign of it being resealed? The other package (identical) had its content in there. Perhaps they were separated during sort so the first package didn't get found?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've received similar packages from the vendor before without any issues. I'm wondering if it was shipped out empty by mistake. I did a search and I did see some similar posts about empty packages which are suspicious and scary at the same time. Here's a similar post but I didn't check the weight on the postage before I discarded the packaging like the OP did - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178474.0
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These packages are the first to be delivered to this new address. I'm worried that this address has already been compromised so early on. Should I burn this address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is definitely keeping me up at night! I would appreciate any feedback. Thanks!

    From what I understand, this is very unlikely to be anything to worry about. First thing that I'd do is message the vendor, ask him if there's any chance he could have accidentally sent it out without contents inside (trust me, shit happens). If it makes you feel any better, I'd clear your house, and wait a week until your order next - just to be on the safe side. Otherwise, I really can't see any issues. Just a question - what quantities are we talking about here, and what substance? Also, what country are you in - or if you're not comfortable with saying that, at least say the general area. Information such as this can always help people understand exactly what is happening, and the chances of it being LE-interfered. From what you've said in your post though, I wouldn't be worried.

    Was there tracking on the package? Sounds like a vendor going bad, ship empty package with tracking, show admins tracking and solid sales history and they will win an escrow dispute. Sounds fucked

    No need to jump to conclusions. It might well have been a complete accident. Contact the vendor and tell them what happened. If they jump straight to defensive mode and accuse you of lying, then this might be true. If they are apologetic and offer to make it right, then this was a premature thought.

    Hi, as someone said no need to jump conclusions, it could one of many reasons, either the customs opened it and took the illicit material and send the letter anyway, or sometimes you have postal thieves, or in our recent case the envelope was weak due to too much focus on the stealth the sorting machine tore the side open, and the product actually fell out, it could be a number of reasons, but consult with your vendor first nonetheless.

    Yeah I wouldn't worry, if it was busted, I don't think they'd just send you the empty package lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What were you buying? Was it a powder or something that doesn't take up much space? Was it completely empty, or did it have other stealth materials (other envelopes, bubble mailer, etc) just no product?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most of the major vendors pre-pack everything, so they can just slap labels on and go. Could have been a fuck-up on their part, forgetting to put the product in while pre-packing.

    Pro tip: Pre packing items actually defeats the purpose of using any vac seal or MBB, its our recommendation to NOT do this until last minute, your actually trying to buy time from the moment it is posted till it hits the customs of receiving country, if shipping internationally that is, the only should be ready and set is all the other tools and materials needed to put the letter/package together. There a good time to most vendors who actually give a shit about their product making it to the buyers letterbox.

    I don't want to jump to conclusions but I'm just hoping that it was a mistake by the vendor - yeah shit happens and that's totally fine. Postal thieves would suck too but I guess it could happen as well and you can't avoid it. The product didn't fall out in this case. The package was perfectly sealed.

    i'm not going to call out the vendor. my main concern is if this incident smells like LE or not. if there's signs of young mail men stealing packages from Europe then that's definitely a threat to all vendors out there. the vendors will need to step up on their stealth game and change out their packaging frequently to prevent these thefts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW - where have you seen these cases? I did a search and not much info came up for "empty packages". I doubt the mail thieves would go out their way to steal the contents of a package and then reseal the package. why wouldn't they just take the whole thing? maybe that's another issue not related to my specific incident. thanks for your feedback though.

    There is pretty big reason to worry. You got an empty package? That is the beginning of an investigation.

    chapter 10 excerpt

    <br/>
    "Long-Term Conspiracy Cases
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Over the years we have learned that drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) utilize parcel systems such as FedEx, UPS, and the USPS to facilitate their drug trafficking. There are times during the investigation of the DTOs’ transportation methods that parcels are intercepted by law enforcement. Unfortunately, delivery time frames are our worst enemy. The traffickers know the system and when a drug parcel is delayed they will probably not accept it. The DTOs use “runners” and lower level persons to take delivery of drug parcels. Due to the limited time available for a suspected parcel to be delivered and to prepare for a controlled delivery, the investigator may be better served conducting a long-term strategic or conspiracy case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In order to identify all of the parties (whether peripheral or mid-level) involved in a DTO, an investigative option is to deliver the parcel with a “sham.” This is where the drugs  are removed (with authority of a search warrant) from the suspected package and “other” material is inserted, such as newspaper. The parcel is delivered and through surveillance an attempt is made to identify the person(s) obtaining the package and where it is ultimately taken (residence/business). During a period of time, many of the DTO suspects can be identified and later criminally charged or indicted for conspiracy to traffic in narcotics or other related criminal charges."
