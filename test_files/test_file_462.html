    Any experience on shipping times going from the UK to the US eastcoast this month? Made my 1st purchase and am getting a little anxious as Ive been waiting about 2 weeks. I know its going through customs and its the holidays and all. But still, should I start worrying or just hold on a bit longer?

    that is very unusual because when i used to buy ivory mdma from the uk, it would arrive in only 3-5 business days to the us.  17 days from us to uk shipping is very strange.  only other times that i had to wait 17-20 days to arrive was when it was shipped from the netherlands.

    Yeah I was surprised myself with it taking that long and especially nervous with it being my 1st order. But I reasoned that UK mail has been slow then it had to pass through US customs at the busiest time of the year and then had to make its way through a heavily burdened USPS. The package hadn't been tampered with and the product was well worth the wait. Ill just chalk it up to the Xmas rush.
