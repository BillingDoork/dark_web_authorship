    So, maybe I am being paranoid, so I am asking peoples opinions on this. I placed an order with a vendor (who I will not name at this point) in the wee hours of the morning on Friday the first. Right around 4-5 am EST. Monday comes and it is still in processing, so I message the vendor and get a reply back that "it will ship out in a couple of hours". My order does not get marked as in transit until a little more than 24 hours later, early morning on Tuesday the 5th. I ordered priority so I expected it within like 4 days or so, but no go. So I message the vendor Thurs. to see if I can get a tracking number, and my message was read, but not responded to for 24 hours. I was told that "we relay info close to receipt date". I thought this odd, since I had ordered priority, and my order was supposedly shipped on the 5th, I should surely be close to receipt date by now. So I waited. Nothing. Now it is Sunday, and I have sent them a message asking if I could get an estimated arrival date for my package, and it has gone unanswered, unread. I have read the vendors reviews, and this does seem to be an issue, and though there are customers who have recieved their package, they seem to all be new forum accounts with very few posts. I did not finalize early. My question is, does this sound like a case of possible address harvesting? I know, I am being a paranoid tweaker, but I am bouncing off the walls with nervous tension over this shite. I have been very careful not to bombard them with to many messages, as there have been reports of them cancelling over that very issue, even after it has been marked in transit...complete with descriptions of "tearing the address labels off the package, and ripping up the envelope". Someone please, tell me I am just paranoid, and that I should go take a benzo. I have been on the road for almost 11 months, and never had anything like this happen before. xoxo sickgirl

    That does seem a bit dodgy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for whether they would farm buyers addresses?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Considering how little they can do to mess with Tor.. It does seem like a very good psyop to bust a lot of buyers on the same day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they suddenly raided 50 or so buyers, even if they only got charges for possession.. The damage they would do to faith in Sr would be HUGE. It doesn't seem that out of the realm of possibility.

    If you guys are worried about "address harvesting", may I suggest from now on you only send your address to a vendor using PGP or a the very least using Privnote. Any reputable vendor will only be too happy to communicate with you in this way. :)

    that's not what I meant. I did send the address via PGP. I am not exactly new to the concept of ordering online. Neither is LE. It is not uncommon (from what I hear) for them to create an account, (or forum post, off silk road, or fake vendor onion, etc. etc.) for the purposes of gathering addresses, and making busts, or at the very least surveiling in hopes of busting a large scale operation. My concern was the latter...address collected and kept to facilitate a bust and arrest of myself and the others in my household. I had an incredibly stupid lapse in judgement, and broke my own rule about not using vendors I trust, and not using a new vendor until good reviews have came in. I went with a new vendor because of their unbelievably low, cheap price on what I was looking for at that moment. xoxo sickgirl

    I 'm sorry sickgirl if I offended you. That wasn't my intention. I know the vendor your speaking about (I too ordered from them and saw your post in another thread). Perhaps just "clean your house" and prepare for the worst if your really concerned. I truly believe though if LE were targeting anyone on SR, it would more than likely be Vendors or buyers making substantial purchases. Although buyers are not safe either, the chances of them targeting small purchases just doesn't stack up for me considering the time and effort required. ;D

    Hmm unbelivably low cheap price.... Did the vendor at least send all samples before selling products. All the decent vendors I have seen (including me) start off with samples.

    HiÂ  foxymeow, the vendor did not offer any samples. The prices were cheap, however they were only slightly cheaper than some already established vendors. I thought they were just under cutting others to establish themselves on SR. The price wasn't so ridiculously cheap that it would arouse any suspicion in ones mind, however time will tell.

    No offence taken love. I was really stressed out when I wrote that, so I apologize if I came off that way. I guess you are right, why would they come kicking in the door over a half g.?
