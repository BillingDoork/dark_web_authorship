    Yes i definitely noticed that all mail has been slower lately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even the deliveries are later in the day. Not sure if it's just due to cut backs or what,
    <br/>
    but it sucks!

    You are not alone. Here is a whole thread about slow USPS:

    I am on day 24 of waiting for a domestic package. My case is probably a lost cause, but I've been on here for 2 years and never had any issues like ones I have experienced in the past month. Just be glad you're actually receiving them. A few vendors have even been adding notices at the tops of their pages letting potential buyers know of these issues.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just read this today from a vendor's page today:
    <br/>
    "The rep was extremely kind enough to let me know there are delays worldwide due to a variety of reasons, storms, less workers, etc. She even said some express could and have been taking up to 9 days."
