    My landlord doesn't live in the same state as me but some of his mail is still coming to my house. I usually give it to him once every few months he decides to take the drive to pick it up.. Would it be wise to place a order with my address but his name since he still gets packages and mail here already?

    Wise? Eh. Doable? Absolutely.

    Send a few test packages that are clean then go from there. He does or doesn't already get packages? I feel like it's normal for letters/mail to show up, but generally speaking packages go to where the person actually lives...especially from a business. It'd be one thing if a friend/family member sent a "care package" or something personal to the old address by mistake. It happens. My mom sends stuff out to old friends and gets them returned from time to time because she hasn't updated the address. Packages tho? Idk.

    What if he surprises you when you don't expect him? Send it right to yourself or if your real paranoid, find a TRUSTWORTHY friend and sent it to him, and cut him in on the goods to keep him happy. Has to be a good friend not just a friend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Know what the difference between a friend and a good friend is????
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A friend will held you move,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A good friend will help you move.......a body.
