    To veteran SR buyers: how do you discreetly and securely dispose of the packaging after you've received the good stuff? If it helps, this would pertain especially to packaging that has been holding strong smelling cannabis. I was thinking just wash the hell out of it with hot water and soap or some such then just throw away as usual. Other methods &amp; tips? Thanks!

    well I'm a new SR buyer so I'm wondering how to dispose of potentially incriminating packaging (like my OP said, packaging that stinks of strong weed!) I have some nosy neighbors as well. They wouldn't open a package addressed to me but I know for sure they have searched through trash before for whatever reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So far all I've come up with is washing the hell out of it and then maybe placing it roughly in the middle of the trash so its not easily found nor stuck to the bottom for whatever reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fire is really not an option where I'm at, too obvious...

    i pick up migrant workers at home depot and then bring them to the Mexican border and hire them cross the border with it. i think they give it to their families to use as fire starter and use as toilet paper. but that's just one of my methods i cant disclose any more information  :-X

    As most people have said, burning it would be the most full proof way. That or just scribble out/scratch out the address and name, then just dispose of it in a public dumpster a good distance away from the delivery address.

     Seems like a silly question to me. Personally I cover my packages in a small layer of lubricant and create a small air balloon to carry it away.

    Just burn it,it might smell of the drugs when it is on fire but if its the size of a normal package it will only take 5 mins at the most to burn completely and the smell/evidence will be gone :)
