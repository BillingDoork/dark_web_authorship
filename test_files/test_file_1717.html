    I'm thinking about placing a order from a vendor (who shall remain nameless) but judging from his/her/their feedback they only triple vac seal and ship it out. How safe is this?

    Triple, even quadruple vacuum sealing result in a drug dog being able to detect in a matter of hours. Moisture barrier mylar bags only! Vacuum seal to save space and make smaller.

    I've gotten around 10 marijuana orders and most come triple vac sealed. 1 came double and I cut the first one and could smell it right away before cutting into the second one. I'm thinking of looking for vendors who only use moisture barrier mylar bags for now on.

    Once I received a trip vac sealed package of weed from a newer vendor (this was a few months ago). The bags were loosely wrapped in fucking newspaper. NEVER EVER AGAIN. Its Mylar bags or NO business. I will not go to jail for some moronic shipping methods.

    The key word here is " Probably " and yes you're right that you'll probably get your domestic order but you run a much higher risk of odour emanating like an accusing finger from your mail . Now the postman,woman,person, isn't in the legal position to anything about it but do you really need the gossip about your recreational habits ?

    It is probably enough for like 12 hours of safety. Then, it will probably only smell a little illegal ;-)

    This thread has a listing of vendors that have claimed they upped their game to the next level with MBBs ("Mylar"+):

    MBBs really contain odor well when sealed properly. Vacuum is not needed. There is a recent rumor/concern that Australia may be scanning for MBBs somehow. Many products are packaged in similar bags, so, I'm not sure if that is likely, even if possible. MBBs are currently thought to be top o' the line stealth. I think food grade bags are good for inner layers and for things that don't smell. Good quality MBBs also make a great visual blockage layer.

    LOTS of food products come in MBB for freshness. There is a thread here somewhere here some kind friends of all of us tested seal with a dog. MBB for the win. I have gotten a few things of late that maybe didnt need it but they did anyway and I liked the extra visual barrier not to mention if you store its works great to keep stuff fresh. I reseal with a consumer sealer and it hold its air under water. Great if you stock up on good herb and you want some stealth at home.

    Personally dank herb is a risk and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

    I've never heard of anybody being able to smell it through all 3 vac seals unless the postal inspectors poked a hole through the bags to insert a camera.   Pretty much everybody used to use double and triple vac seal until there were complaints of Australian customers having there packages seized by customs.   Domestic vendors switched to MBBs due to customer demand, not because domestic packages were being seized.   Before I started using MBBs, I had a 100% success rate and with the MBBs I still have 100% success rate.   It would be interesting to see what the actual change was in the domestic seizure rate after vendors started using MBBs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think some domestic vendors are stressing MBBs because it's an easy way to make an order appear to have good "stealth" when there are other aspects of packaging that are even more important in preventing a domestic package seizure.   What's more important is for a vendor to make sure they are not leaving traces of marijuana on the outer bags and also to make sure the bags are being sealed properly.  A vendor could be using MBBs but also using bad packaging methods that leave traces of weed on the outer bags and you wouldn't even know it.

    This...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Proper sterile environment/surface layer to layer, and no cross contamination is paramount. Outside of the package is where/how it will get profiled and deemed suspicious initially assuming there isn't an odor. If it's not a blue box drop, then the person doing counter drops needs to be "on the level" as well that is so, so important. Return addresses need to be really, really well thought out too. And changed often as possible. PE bags seals do somehow pop sometimes (maybe due to pressure change from high altitude). And the asshole pin prick thing they sometimes do could be bad on a small package. They try and "crush" corners and get a peek inside as well it seems. Those two together is why I always did a box inside a box with layers of normal shipping type paper/peanuts. Lots of legit fragile stuff ships that way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And here's an anecdote that freaked me out recently: I'm watching the 'Hash' episode of Drugs Inc. on Nat Geo. And in the show this sedan in Spain that has perfectly packaged kilos of hash inside the gas tank that a snake camera couldn't detect, but someone touched the outside of the car with a dirty hand and the dog hit on that. That scared me a little. The car had to have been driving around a bit too to get pulled over. And in a hot climate, that prob doesn't get much rain given, but still that was freaky in my mind.

    All true NN. Especially the part about other aspects of stealth. Unless a triple-food-vac package sits for days before being squeezed for a sniff, I dont think man is likely to smell bud. Dogs smell it within hours, though, so some does seep out over time. I just think it is better safe than sorry. I don't think the seizure rate has changed noticeably because I think the other issues in poor stealth are usually the reason for a seizure rather than smell through 2x or 3x food-vacs. I just don't want to be the rare case, so, I use the best I can while trying to do all the other aspects of stealth perfectly.
