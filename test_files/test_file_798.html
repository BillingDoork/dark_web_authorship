    Ok guys i need some input from the community
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Me and My friend recently ordered a medium amount of substance
    <br/>
    not enough in my mind that would warrant anything if caught
    <br/>
    we got the order split and sent too 2 separate Po boxes in the same
    <br/>
    state
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now we are from the land down under, and the order was made
    <br/>
    on the 4th of February From a very trusted and reputable mdma vendor
    <br/>
    from a non-flagged country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now on This vendors has very good feedback and i have engaged in a many conversations
    <br/>
    with him and many people from the same country as me have received product,
    <br/>
    and i asume his stealth is amazing since reported from other buyers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now me and my mates package has not arrived yet, and our other friend who made
    <br/>
    a purchase on his own from this same vendor has not received his packet yet either
    <br/>
    <br/>
    we are going on day 28 now and i believe my other mate is on day 23 now
    <br/>
    <br/>
    we have already been refunded a good amount and we haveÂ  sorted out all the issues
    <br/>
    but now we are fucking paranoid!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i made an order from a very reputable ketamine vendor on the 16th
    <br/>
    now his orders always take 6-7 days to land and iv ordered from him
    <br/>
    more than 10 times, now it still has not showed yet :(
    <br/>
    which is leading me to believe that the split order me and my mate made
    <br/>
    has been caught and we are getting profiled
    <br/>
    <br/>
    could it be possible that customs are checking all mail coming into the country
    <br/>
    from the certain country that the orders originated
    <br/>
    because this vendor has 5 star stealth as i a led to believe from
    <br/>
    buys from the community, it could be that the country is flagged?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i just need some input guys im shitting myself
    <br/>

    Rule 1: ALWAYS abandon an address if you lose a package to it, even if you think the vendor might not have sent it, better safe than sorry.

    <br/>
    Don't stress mate, I've had Aussie customs seize more than an ounce of MDMA to an address before and not even raid it, they don't always take action. Definitely close your PO box though, just in-case, and make sure your house is clean.

    is it possible that if Le is watching our boxes, for the not so big orders that were possibly intercepted,
    <br/>
    that it wouldn't be worth there budget to keep a surveillance on the box's for 2 or 3 weeks max

    Would you say that's the same for a domestic order not arriving ? Obviously could be 50 reasons why it didn't arrive... but yeah never had anything go missing before and I order ALOT of crap off ebay. Maybe I'm being paranoid but who knows if someone is randomly screening a very small percentage of domestic mail every now and again ?

    I wouldn't worry about domestic mail, it doesn't go through customs or any kind of checks.

    Ditto. Alot of times we forget that USPS isnt exactly creme de la creme. They lose/ steal all the time. I would definitely hold off on ordering anything to the PO though.
