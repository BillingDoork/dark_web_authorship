    Well I ordered speed a few weeks ago, maybe a month ago. It got seized because I've yet to receive it from England. This brings me to the question of will UPS watch me for other packages/mail from now on? Will I be under a list?

    Surely UPS don't have any business in what's sent to you. That's not their job.
    <br/>
    Are you 100% sure it was sent and would your country send you a customs letter for smaller amounts if seized?

    Not sure if they send letters cause I'm not from there and I don't wanna bad mouth anyone but just because someone has a good rep doesn't guarantee anything! Have you discussed it with the seller?

    Someone else can probably give you better advice but if I was you I wouldn't use the address for a couple of months at least, see if you get a letter or who knows, maybe the parcel will turn up but if none of those happen I'd say use a different address for a while. I know someone who got a customs letter but was back using the address after a couple of months. The letter was for a big enough amount and the amounts now are a lot less.
