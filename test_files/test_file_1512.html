    Someone I know had a CD recently.  It is not related to the Silk Road, but knowledge is power and may help someone else here so I will share info on it.  It was domestic package, cali to east coast.  Small amount,  2 pounds of weed.   Shipped priority flat rate box.  Triple vacuum sealed.  It did not need to be signed for.  USPS left it by the door.  The recipient left it there for a couple hours before taking it inside the house.   The recipient left the house several hours later, as he/she was leaving LE raided.  I would assume they had it under surveillance when it was delivered  and raided when recipient left in case the recipient was bringing the package to a different location.  Hard to say what tipped them off, the address may have been flagged they received a few packages a week from cali.  Or could have been a snitch.  Unknown at this point, but should find out later from the lawyers.   A couple other interesting points, the bail was set pretty low, under 30,000 which to me implies not that serious, I guess because it wasn't really a large amount or hard drugs.  Also interesting to know that they did not need to get recipient to sign for the package.  I am assuming that by the recipient taking possession of the package by bringing it into the house, that met the conditions of the search warrant.   This is in an urban environment, which makes surveillance easier, I can imagine that this would be much harder for LE to do if the recipient house was in the middle of the woods with no discreet place to park and watch.
    <br/>
    I will keep you updated as it goes through the legal process.
    <br/>
    If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer to best of my ability as long as I can do so while keeping the details anonymous.

    I almost don't believe this....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do you know this information? How do you know it was triple vacuum sealed? How do you know this person had multiple packages per week? How do you know the amount?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hate to say it but it smells like bullshit. You provide an odd amount of details for somebody that was a spectator, unless this was of course you, in which case it was SR related because you're posting about it here, because of this happened to me I sure as well would not be posting about it here even in third person offering to answer questions right after I just posted bail. The fact that you're offering to answer questions sounds as if you made this up and want some attention. Though I could be wrong. This really does sound like a made-up story though mostly because of the perspective from which the story was told.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Address flagged? For receiving a couple of packages in a week from cali? Bullshit. California is a HUGE business hub and plenty of people around the country receive packages on a frequent basis from cali. I order crap from amazon all the time and literally 95% of the stuff I order happens to come from California.

    I am extremely skepticle.

    If OP is telling truth, this happened because someone snitched.

    Beleive it or not.  It does not matter to me.  If you can take something from it, then do so.  If not, then sorry that you wasted 20 seconds reading my post.  I posted it because maybe it will be informative to someone, and in a manner that is not in any way harmful to me.   And for the record, no it was not me that received the package.  You will have to use your imagination how I know some details.  Or you can think I made it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And believe it or not, there are MANY people that have never even heard of SR that  have been and continue to send a shitload of drugs in the mail.  Just becuase someone is sending drugs through the mail does not mean it is SR related.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the other person that asked if the package was opened, no the package was not opened.

    I doubt you'll ever find out from the cops and lawyers how they got tipped.  They'll give a bullshit story about an anonymous tipster phone-call or something to cover the truth.  Almost surely it was a snitch tho.  LE function purely on two things - luck and snitches.  If you get busted, you either had a snitch or you ran out of luck.

    Bad advice is bad.  It's not all about luck and snitches.  Good policework can go a long way.  When they want you, they will get you.

    Ordering any number of repeat packages from anywhere is not going to spark a full blown investigation to somebody, it won't flag their address, nor will it make people suspicious and report them. At the very most it might make the mail man think something but he/she isn't going to report you to anybody just because you get a lot of packages from one location. Just thinking about such an idea as that is ludacris. On the other hand if your packages are stinking, suspicious, and poorely put together, then that is a different story.

    Actually, though, I tend to believe OP.  I don't understand why it's on the SR forums if it's not a SR purchase, but I don't see any motivation to post his experience other than a general desire to give a true account of a scary experience.

    <br/>
    And if he made it up I think he would have made the amounts/items/suspense/character drama more exciting.  For example: I had a CD today.  I stuck 3 kilos of cocaine up my bum after I opened it just for safe keeping! Then I got on my motorcycle to see this one stripper I've been seeing on the DL, ya know, and we were gunna go backstage with Swedish House Mafia and roll our asses off but then a helicopter swooped in and shot me in the gut and chucked a piece of paper at me. I opened it up and it was the delivery receipt for the cocaine!! Whoa!! And in big red letters on it was written "NAILED YOU, BITCH". Then I passed out and awoke in hospital with my dick being sucked by the nurse.  She just handed me an 8-ball and kept on going.  I should get CDed more often!!11! Just wanted to share my, I mean my friends story! Whoopsie!

    There are a number of ways LE could have found this package such as if the source was compromised, if the packaging was significantly exposed to weed or weed smoke, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do appreciate that the OP is demonstrating to people that the police can bust you without a signature.  That said, ordering without a signature can be beneficial because (1) you will know something is wrong if they ask for a signature anyway and (2) you can scope out if you're being watched before picking up a package.  Ideally let the package sit there for a few days but very few people have the patience for that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I wouldn't want to receive weed without it being a moisture barrier bag (MBB) but I don't have any proof that triple-sealing in plastic wasn't sufficient.  Maybe it was.  I just prefer MBB.

    this was one of the reasons i had suggested on dropping any packages in the trash can when delivered - ie, to give LE a chance to show up - and for those that need a paint by the numbers version, ala last time, the packages are addressed to a fictitious name, one that for some reason i've had mail show up here for the past two years that i've never met or heard of (i've lived here 20+ years).  i know when garbage collectors are coming,  so i'm not planning on leaving it till the trash is picked up but sitting in the trash for a couple of days gives me some plausible denialability

    I've read a case where the guy threw the package into the garbage.  The prosecutor used it as evidence that he knew there were illegal drugs in the package.  The prosecution won and he went to jail.

    Can you recall some specific details or a link to this case?

    Is it illegal to dispose of delivered mail? Either way, throwing a package in the trash does not constitute a demonstration of knowledge regarding its contents; the prosecutor may have argued otherwise, but its not compelling.

    Apologies, I just did a good bit of searching and didn't find it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree that throwing a package away doesn't itself prove knowledge of the package contents.  However, it is suspect and combined with other suspect evidence a jury may be compelled to believe the defendant had constructive possession.  Maybe the other evidence is drug paraphernalia and the purchase of bitcoins.  Of course, most people ordering on SR unfortunately probably have drugs at their drops which are usually their own homes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One of the things needed to prove constructive possession is control of the area where the drugs were found.  Thus, if possible, I recommend leaving the drugs in an area you don't control.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The system in the US is bullshit.  Beyond a reasonable doubt my ass.  If you receive drugs and you've got drugs already then you're fucked.  Last year dutchaanbod accidentally sent orders of 50g and 100g to customers that had already received those packages a couple of months prior.  Had some of those packages gotten caught then those people might be spending years in jail for something they didn't order but no jury is going to believe that somebody just sent them extra drugs they didn't ask for.

    Despite what people think the Legal system in the USA does not work on a strict set of laws, especially when you are taken to court. Once you're in court it all boils down to manipulation of logic, infference(what reason would a person through away a peice of mail that didn't have their name on it?, sketch), and money, etc etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't rely on dancing around legal loopholes to save you, because it won't really matter when they take you to court and the prove your actions as unusual and suspicious. Ultimately the judges rule can override many laws and loopholes. It's best to appear to have maximum plausibile deniability and simply act from and act with the mentality of a sane person who is following all laws. Act suspicious and it will ruin your case.

    +1 good post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll also point out that long before any trial they'll throw you in jail with a bond of maybe $50k or maybe $300k.  They'll seize your property.  There are costs and fines.  They'll scare the shit out of you to get a plea and you probably will plea because going to trial is scary as shit.

    It is still illegal at the federal level, all the more because it is crossing state lines although the supreme court says that it is illegal either way.  Maybe the feds won't bother for 2 pounds but the answer to your question is "yes."

    Yes although they don't have to hand over anything until after indictment which nowadays often doesn't occur until long after arrest.
