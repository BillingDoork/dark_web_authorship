    Hi,
    <br/>
    A quick question if its not too much info.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you ship a package, I´m guessing no one does just a letterbox drop. You go up to the counter with a big bundle of letters and tell the person that you want them sent ?. What kind of confirmation do you ask for in return. I´m not talking about recorded delivery ones. Just standard first and second class letters. Is it not risky going to the post office with like a big bundle of letters? do you alternate post offices in  the same town? different towns? or do you hop the shipments? so send from yourself to another contact in a different part of the country then have them re-shipped from there?.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please answer only the parts that you feel won´t compromise you. I´m interested in becoming a seller, and the info I´ve found online aint too helpful. thanx

    For standard class letters you can just drop them in the mailbox. For packages we go upthe counter. It's not suspicious because there are people running legal businesses (like eBay) and they need to ship packages everyday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Though you don't want to take risks. Alternate post offices and even town if you are paranoid.

    Thanks for that! Really helpful +1 karma for you  :P
    <br/>
    Two more questions. If you post in a letterbox how can you confirm you have posted it in case of a dispute?  also what´s a DCN ?

    DCN is delivary confirmation. You can get the notes at any post office. Put the note on the package and add 75 cents of stamps to the package (that's how much DCN should cost). Keep the receipt which comes with every note so later on you got the number and can check it online

    Why aren't you dropping pkgs as well? There are any number of things that could happen to your pkgs en route that could end up with the contents being revealed.  It would take Postal Inspectors about 15 minutes to identify the person shipping that piece of mail  Also, they would be able to identify  the other pkgs you shipped along with that one and easily pull them all out of the system for inspection.
