    My vendor gave me the tracking number and it appears it was delivered. I don't know if they just lost it or an employee took it (which I suspect) but in either case what can I do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know the UPS store is not recommended for this but it's the least bad option I have now. Any friends I could trust with this all work during the day as do I. I could have it delivered to my home or one of theirs which would provide absolutely no security, or have it delivered to my work place, which I'm sure you can imagine would invite a lot of unwanted scrutiny.

    &gt;UPS or USPS?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPS (United Parcel Service), though it was shipped via USPS (United States Postal Service).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;Do they just deny recieving it or what?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically, yes. I went to them a few times before contacting my vendor and getting a tracking #. They said they had no packages for me and their was nothing in my mailbox. I thought about going back to them with the tracking # to see if that would help them find it. Is that a good idea?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, while I understand the vendor is not responsible to refund or replace this, is it fair to ask for a small free sample as a show of good faith, since this was my first transaction with SR ever, and I want to be reassured it is not a scam. (Assuming I can come up with a better location to have it shipped to.)

    It seems unlikely a UPS Store employee copmmited a federal offence to steal what was likely a nondescript package and it's probably lost. I don't think the vendor owes you anything.

    It's not a matter of being owed something, it is a matter of making a small gesture to give some reassurance that Silk Road as a whole is not a scam (which if it was I would, of course, be owed everything but be unable to collect it). The tracking # does not prove that it is not a scam, since it only shows it was delivered to my city and zip code, I'm sure a clever scammer could find the tracking # of a package that just happened to be going to the same town and zip and use that.

    The site is not a scam and that should be fairly easy to figure out without a comp. Look around, look at all the posts by people who have received successfully, look at the estimated over 100 million in anual sales. Surely you can put it together.

    It turns it was a mistake on the part of the UPS store and I did get my package unopened, product in tact. I an admitting I was wrong. For anyone wanting to say "I told you so", I am trying to do right by my vendor (Underground Syndicate), and by Silk Road itself. I am also hoping to reassure those who come after me who have doubts (whether reasonable or just reasonable in their own minds) that Silk Road is the Real Deal!

    I dont know why you would get a package shipped ups or fedex anyways, thats just sketchy period. You do know that UPS and FedEx reserve the right to open any package they deem suspicious right. Now granted USPS can do the samething but they need to get a search warrant to do so, and not just any USPS worker can do it either it has to be the USPS Officer. Any person from UPS or FedEx can open it, and I was just reading a cpl weeks back that the DEA and other LE are teaming with UPS and FedEx to crackdown on the trafficing of drugs through the mail because of that reason. I noticed a couple vendors offering UPS next day delivery on the site and it steers me the other way. It's nerve racking enough sometimes receiving a big package through USPS I wouldnt sleep at night knowing it was in FedEx Or UPS hands. Just my take on the whole situation.
