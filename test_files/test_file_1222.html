    200 hits of blotter LSD has not delivered - 27 days and counting. I used the top UK vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Their previous order took six days total - transit to delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stealth was A+ on prior order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMO the only way this letter could have been intercepted would have had to been due to an X ray of a flat business envelope, just like the one you would send your Grandmother a letter in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are UK / USA customs starting to x ray flat letters these days. This seems unlikely due to the volume of mail being handled IMO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can any UK to USA vendors, or USA from UK buyers shed any light on the screening process for letter mail, specifically LSD?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm very sure 200 hits of Lucy is dealer quantity. Drop address is prepped for the worst case as of now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At best, how long does it that for customs to send out a love letter?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At worst, how long would it take for controlled delivery take to happen?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How often does a flat letter sent Royal Mail to USA take a month or more to show?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or is this letter just lost in a black hole of lost letters?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stupid question that I already know the answer to - I should consider this drop address dead forever, correct?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for any input.

    Hmm doesn't seem right. 27 days is quite a long time. !4 days is the longest it's ever taken for me from the UK to western US but I have seen people say it's taken 20+ days. If you ordered from a top vendor with excellent stealth, chances are it being intercepted isn't the problem. Keep us updated!

    I remember on the vendor profile of who you must be talking about that they were backed up, so actual shipping 4 days after marked in transit. It could have been shipped late,in which case it could still be on the way. Best of luck...

    All has been centrally stored at the house.

    Chances are if the package is going to be intercepted it already has been. If they haven't kicked the ol' door down, I'd guess your odds are getting better and better every day they won't. Atleast for that package. I'd just deny the package if it shows up oddly as you already got your refund, and maybe avoid mailing there for 6 months or something. Best of luck!

    Thanks for the kind words dabdiego.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I received two domestic orders this week, last one was yesterday. (benzos of course to calm me down a bit.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, to me this might imply I'm good to go or the wheels of LEO turn mighty slow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going to give all orders, especially UK and German orders a break for a few months to this address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll bump the thread as to what the final outcome is down the road...
