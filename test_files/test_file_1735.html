    Ok so ive read all the stickies and gone over numerous threads but they all seem to be lacking GOOD information. When ordering international bulk From overseas to The U.S. I can not seem to get a good solid answers how one should go about receiving these packages. Obviously with bulk orders no one is going to risk shipping to their legit address. So it leaves the question almost all the international bulk vendors they all have good stats and have had alot of success shipping to the US but most of them all require tracking and when receiving tracked orders from over-seas alot of the times you have to sign for the package. SO HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSE TO RECEIVE IT. send it to a drop house? what happends when they leave a note and you have to sign for it your fucked. IF anyone can enlighten me on how the fuck everyone receives their international bulk without shipping it to their address it would be appreciated. Not really interested in opening a Fake P.O. box Either i feel like its just asking to get fucked with all the cameras and identity verification.
