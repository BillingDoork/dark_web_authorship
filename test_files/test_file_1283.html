    Today I received a notice in my mailbox that something (neither 'letter' nor 'parcel' are checked off on the notice) was attempted to be delivered to me and that I should go pick it up at the post office. It says I have 30 days to claim the package before they open it. If I were to pick it up, I would have to arrive with ID and sign for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is fishy for more reasons than one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First- I have never ordered anything off SR that requires a signature, let alone anything bigger than very, very personal use.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second- the one outstanding order I have, which was likely not even sent, was a 10 strip of LSD from Europe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Third- That they're threatening to open the package instead of returning to sender.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anybody have any idea what may be happening? I've messaged all recent vendors I've used to ask if they've recently mailed a package in my direction by accident. I do not expect to be receiving the LSD, much less do I expect to be considered a big enough fish for LE with my measly 10 hits. My one suspicion is that, it being a somewhat newly rented home, they do not have proof that my name is attached to the residence. Does anybody know what might happen if they do open it up?

    If you're in Canada this is regular procedure for packages coming registered mail from other countries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most of my larger MDMA orders had to be signed for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had 2 different orders from out of country nabbed at customs and they sent a letter.Â  Using two different addresses.
    <br/>

    Go in with ID and your delivery slip and pick it up...

    Thanks. My concern is that I don't even know what the package is, but that it is SR-related beyond doubt. I might let this one go for that reason alone, I'm just worried that it comes back to haunt me.

    good advice but the nature of SR means your gut instict is to always freak out, and expect the worse. getting busted buying personal amounts is rare.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if it makes you feel any better, ive had a similar situation. i ordered from a vendor that forgot to waive the signature(didnt know this at the time), i go to pick it up at my drop house and instead there's a "we missed you" usps note on the door, i freaked out but i was hurting in withdrawals so i just said fuck it. went the main post office and signed for it, was totally fine. i know its not the same exact situation you're in, but when something weird happens on here you feel like you're for sure getting busted, i doubt thats the case for 10 hits of acid - good luck!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    id be more worried about not picking it up, and them opening it and finding out what it is, but who knows

    You mentioned a 10 strip of LSD.. Vendor probably sent it priority. Registered mail. Even if the vendor doesn't check off for a signature canada post the majority of the time will require a signature.

    I'm waiting on a reply from the LSD vendor. If it's him, I'll be relieved as fuck. Thanks for the replies everybody, you've all played part in relieving me as well. Thankfully I have at least 15 days to make this decision.

    I've had the same issues with Canada Post -&gt; USA. Even if the Canadian vendors do not require a signature, it will almost always be default.... So be sure you trust your vendors stealth and go with your gut.. I have found 9/10 times they've asked me for a signature it was just a postal fuck up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Besides, in CD's, they seem to be executed pretty poorly and there's usually a lot of dead-giveaways that deviate from standard postal procedure, or at least this seems to be a common pattern... so pay attention to your post in case they ever try to get you to sign in a suspicious manner... though most of the time it is fine....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are really worried about it and don't want to lose the package, just clean house, and go pick it up. Most CD's won't give you the chance to pick it up at the post office, and will try to force you to sign it at your door, it seems. From what I know, a good lawyer can get a package you sign for thrown out in court since there's no way to prove you ordered anything, but in the instance of a CD, they mainly use the package to get into your house and find other contraband, which if they do, then the package CAN be pinned on you.

    Yup this is very true, there have been anecdotal reports of some buyers having to sign despite me not purchasing the signature option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plus if it was sent registered mail it is very likely you will have to sign for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I agree a CD will likely be done at your door rather then a post office

    Hi man,
    <br/>
    if you had no SR-related custom-problems til now, you should go to pick it up and hide it somewhere outside (if itÂ´s SR-stuff)! Of course cleaning up your residence before!
    <br/>
    If everything is fine for the next 2-3 days, you are out of trouble.
    <br/>
    Cause at least when they open that package, they will visit you!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...and you could avoid this by going to the PO!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Though, wish you the best!!

    Do other canadian vendors find this the case? or US buyers from canadian vendors? I know that shipping with USPS you don't need a signature and it seems with certain canadian postage options (mostly the ones with tracking #s) they say it's optional?

    It would seem that you're better off going to get it. I only have a PO Box, and frequently have to signÂ  for parcels. It would be very, very suspicious for me to refuse a parcel. My guess is that the chances of the Canada Post workers opening it go from 0.01% to 100% when someone sketches out and refuses a parcel.

    I am a Canadian vendor at is is impossible to send tracked/express mail through Canada Post into the USA without a signature being required. This is one of the big reasons I refuse to send express mail into the states and only send by regular "snail mail" and it's refereed to on here. Most customers are not at all comfortable signing for their orders and there are also many more security issue on my end that make it so it is only possible to send by regular mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sp, if you are ordering off a Canadian vendor and you order Express mail and he claims you won't have to sign for it he is lying....All express orders going into the USA from Canadian sent by Canadian Post must be signed for.
