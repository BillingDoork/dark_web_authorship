    5 business days I'm assuming. All you can do is wait, you can ask the vendor for the DCN and look it up to see if it's sitting in a specific sorting facility for too long. It may have been a USPS screw up and you'll still receive it, just gotta wait. After 14 days you may get a love letter in the mail from the postal inspector, telling you that the package was seized for containing such.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Around this same time you also may get a note from USPS saying your package was delivered but you weren't available to sign for it, and you can pick it up at the post office. I don't know anyone whose actually went to pick it up so I wouldn't recommend it, but from everything I've read it seems the postal inspector removes the drugs, reseals the package and remails it - so it's possible you can pick your package up, but there would be nothing in it so why take the risk?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or neither the package nor love letter comes, then I don't know what to tell you.

    I've had legitimate priority mail take 10 days.  Sometimes it just falls off the conveyor belt and sits there until someone notices/cares.

    If you are concerned about the law, if you don't receive a letter from customs saying your package was seized it's almost certainly one of the following things:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was stolen by your mail carrier or at the sort facility
    <br/>
    The vendor never shipped it to you
    <br/>
    Like someone said it may have fallen off the conveyer or been put accidentally into the wrong sorting 'tube'
    <br/>
    USPS sucks balls lately because of major cutbacks, so 'priority' doesn't necessarily mean priority anymore
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you've hit the 3 week mark you almost 100% are never going to receive the package, but as stupid as it sounds it can actually take domestic shipping upwards of that time to arrive.

    The odds of the package getting swiped increase dramatically if it is not packaged well.  If the drunk package handler who works at 3AM smells weed or can feel pills, he will take them.
