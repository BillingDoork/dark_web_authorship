    i was wondering if they post office will ask you to sign for it when i go to pick it up cuz
    <br/>
    its from out of country..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    let me know your experience with this
    <br/>

    if you did some research you would read in the profiling. Its always a red flag from out of country to po boxes if you read in the shipping profiling from the feds its pinned about.
    <br/>
    anyways to answer your question you sign a signature card when you open the box this allowing the agent to sign for you, but again i would go with an address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck on your order man

    I'm in the same boat as Lorax and concerned with getting a shipment from overseas to a PO box.Â  It's not a small amount, just a g of MXE, but I was wondering if anyone has experiences with that kind of shipment working/ not working. Thinking about getting it from the vendor Tunbear.
