    Yes. I got about $1,000 worth of opiates shipped to me and received them safe and sound after the seizure. If you're not getting your package, it's more likely that the vendor simply didn't ship it than there being any police related problem (though definitely take reasonable precautions). Some vendors probably chose not to ship after realizing they wouldn't be getting their money from escrow.

    <br/>
    I don't think there have been any vendor arrests except for the one guy in the UK who sent his address unencrypted and made orders with his vendor account.
