    So I understand it's a required signature for USA, but are you able to cross out the signature section on the prepaid boxes/parcels? Is there any way to waive the signature? Such as running a line through it, writing 'no sig', 'ok to safedrop' or printing some type of label to put on it? Change it online?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If not, what options do I have to order from Canada that don't require signatures and should I just do the signature, not a full name? Use a pseudonym?

    All xpresspost from canada to usa requires signature no way around it. I have received 5 bulk packs from canada and they only attempt to deliver the package once so if your not home your pretty much fucked. Canadian postal service almost makes US look good. Also keep in mind what a signature means is that package worth the time in jail, we all know what a signature means. Also i have personally had to hunt down my parcel twice from canada.

    Oh finally if you do get xpress realize that it will be a different mail man than your normal one so you probably wont be able to tell if its a CD or not even if its unlikely. Best of luck and i find that shipping from overseas is more worth it than from canada depending on what your trying to get. I get most packs from uk in 7 bus days thats only 2 longer than canada.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LAST THING AND PLEASE REMEMBER it from my experiences they do NOT update tracking at all. Literally it will be at your door when tracking says its still in montreal so be on the look out cuz u get 1 delivery attempt.

    CanadaPost DOES make the USPS service look good. We probably have the slowest federal postal service ever, and the only way to get tracking is to pay for express which for USA or international orders MUST be signed for and is expensive! This is why I only ship via regular post and the only ONE complaint my customers can have is that orders usually take close to two weeks to arrive because Canada Post is so fucking slow. Although, you must realize we are in a county with the most unpopulated land in the world AND a population of only 30 million versus the USA 333 million! So OF COURSE our postal service is going to be WAY slower. We are WAY more rural.
