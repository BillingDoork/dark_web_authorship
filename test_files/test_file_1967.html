    I'm located in Korea, and it's gotten to the point where I am in desperate need of some party favors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Korea, like the rest of Asia, is incredibly strict on drugs, but I'm thinking if I'm just ordering a gram or two of MDMA the risk isn't THAT high because A) MDMA doesn't really exist here and I'm pretty sure customs wouldn't know what it was if they saw it and B) it's such a small amount that it would be pretty hard to detect it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone successfully had MDMA or a similar substance shipped to Korea or Japan?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance.

    Cant offer any advice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if they found it, they would know its drugs even if they didnt know it was MDMA just by looking.

    That's true. I realized that after I posted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just can't decide whether or not I should risk this. I've had legal herbal supplements sent to me here from the US, and the package was never opened...
