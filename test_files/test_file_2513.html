    No, it is not a requirement. It is for only your own protection so it is optional.

    I recommend learning how to do so though.

    As others have said, it's not a requirement.  But you should treat it like one.  After all, it's your freedom at risk.

    Once you know how to do it, it only takes seconds.  Check out these threads:

    I have to reiterate the previous posts for full effect: No, usually sellers do not require that. But if you are planning to become a long-term user of SR, it is highly recommended to learn to use PGP. Try it, once you learn it you just might encrypt your every message. It's just that simple to use and safe as hell.

    Here il make a lil more easier to understand
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go download yr pgp program and install, i use gpa i think well thats the folder name anyways
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now go to the vendors page and copy and paste the pgp key from the --- to the ---... all of it.
    <br/>
    Put that into a text document on yr pc and save.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    open up pgp and you want to hit import... then import the text doco with the key in it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it should come up with new key found and then be in yr key manager
    <br/>
    <br/>
    go to clipboard and type yr name and addy then hit encrypt and choose the vendors key
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it will then be an encrypted msg that u copy and past in the address box on the order page
    <br/>
    <br/>
    very simple

    The reason you would want to encrypt your address is this: If you send your address unencrypted, then the SR servers have your order info and address. If LEO controls the server currently, or it is compromised in the future,  there is a chance they've got your info on file. If you encrypt using PGP, then the only person who can read your address is the vendor who posesses the private key. If SR gets busted, all they have is a string of gibberish characters with no way to extract your name or address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pretend that your address is a note that you're passing to your vendor through SR. If you just write it out, anyone who wants to look could see it. If you encrypt it, people could still see it, they just wouldn't be able to make sense of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Learn GPG. It only takes but a moment, and the peace of mind is priceless.

    Thank you all - I could not understand why vendors post a key code but not an email address, now I  finally understand that PMs can be encrypted.
    <br/>
    TOR just hides where you are geographically - what we are typing can be read by eavesdroppers, they just don't know where we.  That is, until we provide a vendor with a name &amp; address that aren't encrypted - it all makes sense now.  Ready to buy now!!  Thanks again!

    i didn't really think of the scenario that SR would get busted, so i guess with that in the back of your mind GPG encryption is a good idea. The point is that Tor traffic is already encrypted, so apart from silkroad i don't think anybody can access it, in practice, except the tor exit operator.

    You should never send any personal identifiable information unencrypted, always always always use PGP/GPG encryption, do not use privnote either, involving a 3rd party only exposes you to unnecessary risks. There are some really good tutorials on here if you need any help.

    NO WAY! if you sign it then you lose a good deal of your plausible deniability should you be sending your addy to LE

     <br/>
     <br/>
     it should come up with new key found and then be in yr key manager
     <br/>
     <br/>
     go to clipboard and type yr name and addy then hit encrypt and choose the vendors key
     <br/>
     <br/>
     it will then be an encrypted msg that u copy and past in the address box on the order page

    Okay, I'm still trying to get this to work.  I am following these instructions plus another nearly identical set of instructions from a tutorial and I cannot import any keys.  I am copying &amp; then pasting the vendor key into a text document and saving the document.  I go to pgp and open up the gpa Privacy Assistant and click import &amp; select the file containing the key.  Every time I get a message that says "no keys found".  I am copying the entire key from --- to ---.  Have tried several vendor keys. I was able to import other keys using this same method when I first set up the pgp but it doesn't work now, no clue what's wrong. Anyone care to help?  Thank you ~

    Take some advice: forget about GPG4WIN.  Try GPG4USB instead -- it has an interface that 100x easier to use, let alone understand. The documentation on the GPG4USB site is also excellent -- it shows you how to use the program -- with screenshots.  Furthermore, you don't even have to install GPG4USB on your machine -- you can unpack the software onto a folder on a USB stick and run it from there. (Naturally, you can also run it from a folder on your computer, if that's what you'd rather do.)
