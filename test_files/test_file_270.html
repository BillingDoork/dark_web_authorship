    Dont talk with Police. We dont know your country laws etc..but normally you dont even have to talk to police or follow this letter.

    Only a judge can tell you to come in for questions.

    Depends on your country but I think it is common sense here. So generally, if something like this happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. clean your home. This makes you much more comfortable. ,-)
    <br/>
    2. If they do not "call you in" (too lazy for LEO DICT right now) you do not have to go anywhere. Just ignore the letter and clean your home.
    <br/>
    3. Make sure your IT Sec. is up to date. No traces on your PC etc. (much info here and on the clearnet)
    <br/>
    4. Make your self comfortable with the law in your country. If my guess is right (here it would be) 10g hasi plus 1g of coke is nothing (much) to worry about. Its personal use AND who said it is yours?! Because some stranger shipped you some drugs and called the police?!
    <br/>
    5. If they get penetrant and write again or visit you. Just be polite and tell them your name and NOTHING else. You dont have to talk to them and you really should not.
    <br/>
    6. Think about a new drop address for online orders. Even if they cant touch you on this order I (personally) would not risk to use this address again. (on the other hand ... hehe)
    <br/>
    7. If you what to keep your DL, its is sometimes a good idea to stop consuming a few month.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...just some points that come in my mind if I here your story.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    take care

    Unless your atty. name is Mr. Google, you should be getting advice from a legal expert in your area. It will cost you a 100 or so, well worth the price of assurance. Google isn't always correct, for real, talk to a lawyer if you're that worried.

    where im from (Scandinavia) I noticed the same, in letter from police they wrote that in case of absence, they would come get me at home or work..
    <br/>
    I guess the best advise is to say nothing and talk to a lawyer.
    <br/>
    When I was in once though, I just denied all and pretended like nothing. Eventually case got dismissed "because of a lack of evidence".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Non-drug related, but I recently read about a case where police dismissed charges because it was took too much resources for such a small case. Atleast where I am, I think resources is a problem for LE, and they are even neglecting more serious cases than small drug-cases because of low resources, and stretching their resources may be a good thing.
    <br/>
    So if you decide on a lawyer, still go there, and after a lil small-talk with the detective and occupying their time, tell them you wont say anything about this case without a lawyer.. try stretch it and make it as time-consuming and complicated for them as possible, aslong as you can still act innocent. That's what I will try next time,lol =P

    The best free advice you will ever get.

    <br/>
    Deny, Deny, Deny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police who have anything with proof on you will do what's called a "controlled delivery." They will pretend to be your mail man/fedex/ups guy and hand you the package. In this case, you are fucked. It's game over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they just knock and your door and want to talk or write you a letter, we call this a "knock &amp; talk" it means they have nothing on you, no proof, and are trying to trip you up with leading questions.

    It's pretty much been covered in the responses you have had already but just to reiterate say NOTHING to the police, if they pull you in for questioning they will probably try and scare you will all sorts of stuff but unless you give them something they have nothing, the only person talking in a scenario like this should be your lawyer. Nearly every single case of people who have been charged is the result of them talking and admitting to the offense.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Clean your home, redact your hard drives and stay calm and do not allow yourself to be tricked or coerced into incriminating yourself, that's the best advice you will get.

    Yeah but the problem with the 'say nothing' to the police advise, is that with the exception of the US and Holywood films, not doing so instantly pegs you as being suspicious.  Maybe they're used to the people they're questioning in the US just standing there mute, but I'm not sure that would fly in all parts of the world, especially if they came to your door where there should be a presupposition that you have no idea why they're talking to you.

    In this situation though, I would definitely clean house, and go get some legal advise, pronto.

    You're at a distinct advantage that you got a letter and that they didn't just turn up on your doorstep, because you have time to prepare.

    This.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police with enough evidence for an arrest don't send letters cordially inviting criminals to attend the station to be arrested.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police who are hoping to intimidate you into doing something silly, on the other hand, might well send you a letter in the hope you panic and decide it's best to 'come clean'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shred the letter, clean your house and go on with your life. Maybe take a month off SR and find a new shipping address for good measure.

    I agree to a point; however I think getting rid of the letter and acting like nothing happened is a better option than saying anything silly. If they do show up, maintain that you have no idea what they're talking about. If they arrest you, that's when you should say "Sorry I don't want to talk to you until my lawyer is present". There's nothing suspicious about that, it's what anyone who's been charged with a crime they didn't commit would do (assuming they have a reasonable level of intelligence).

    By say nothing I mean admit nothing, basically deny all knowledge. If you get hauled into the police station it would be entirely reasonable to say you will not speak until you have your lawyer present though.

    Being suspicious doesn't prove guilt. If a police officer is taking there time to mail you/question you then they already assume your suspicious. Like he said clean house and if your are "picked up" deny everything, if i was you id drop your pc off at a place unrelated to you just for added security. Either way the swiss LE have to prove you in-fact had knowledge of this package arriving. ANYONE CAN MAIL ANYONE ANYTHING. It is asinine to assume that just cause something illegal was sent to a certain location, that the person who owns that location is 100% guilty, sure its suspicious as hell but LE intercepting the package is only the beginning of the case of course they will try to question, scare tactics are mostly all they know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Clean house and don't let it bug you they are trained to read body language and can tell when one is nervous or hiding something.
    <br/>
    Good Luck

    We know almost nothing about the OP. There are various reasons why it may not be in his/her interest to raise suspicions with police. Most innocent people do not have lawyers on speed dial.

    OP: do you know if you have a right to a lawyer present for questioning by LE? (it ISN'T the case everywhere)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If yes, then I would do as firehawk suggests: destroy all trace of the letter and move on. Practice your surprised look in the mirror if you have to. If LE show up, then get your lawyer.
    <br/>
    If no, then get the lawyer now so that they can advise you.
    <br/>
    If you're unsure, forget raising suspicions and get the lawyer now.
    <br/>

    Really, unless you're in the U.S., Canada, U.K., or Australia, don't go seeking legal advice on SR. What you are told may be completely, utterly wrong.

    Pretty much what everyone else has said.
    <br/>
    No matter what the police say, DENY EVERYTHING and do not say anything. Everything you say is just evidence that can be used against you.
    <br/>
    They will try and tell you you will be better off if you talk to them, but you won't be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DENY EVERYTHING and you have nothing to worry about.

    Call a lawyer and let the police pick you up. Who cares if they pick you up or show up there, ultimately you'll end up in the same place. Never, ever talk to police without a lawyer my friend, I'm speaking from experience. You'll be fine as long as you don't open your mouth and start rambling. Good luck.

    The only thing they might try to do is to arrest you on SUSPICION.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is only a scare tactic, they have nothing, will get nothing (assuming you house cleaned appropriately), and will do nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF this happens, hold your ground, deny everything (maybe express some outrage that you feel like you're being victimized).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF this doesn't happen, and they just want a 'chat', again DENY everything!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A false name is the perfect alibi, you have NOT touched the package, there is NOTHING to link it to you. Anyone could've sent it to your address with the hopes of grabbing it as it was left waiting there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the vendor messed up, then that's their own fault, as long as you house clean, nothing can be done to you. The evidence is circumstantial and won't ever hold up in court (unless you admit stuff).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF they arrest you on suspicion (before that you are just 'helping them with their inquiries', pffft), and you successfully deny everything and keep your cool, then they will de'arrest you, and off you go, free as a bird ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But Switzerland is more lenient than the UK, so I think you'll be alright :)

    "Deny, deny, deny" is not the same as "say nothing." I would do the latter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Denying everything gives them a story for them to poke holes in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They want to talk to you so you can fuck yourself over by either admitting something you shouldn't have, or denying something where they can prove that you were lying. Being caught in a lie, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, is WAY more suspicious than saying nothing at all and can get you convicted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They don't wanna talk to you to "clear this all up." They want to talk to you so you say something that fucks you. If you say nothing, they have wasted their time; they'll know nothing more about you or your case than before they talked to you.

    Wanted to tell the same, been in similar situation long time ago.
    <br/>
    Got a call from them, that they want to speak with me.
    <br/>
    Asked them back, if am i a suspect or just for questioning. (if youre a suspect, you can bring your lawyer, as you would defend yourself, and dont have to answer all questions).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and if for questioning, just deny everything.. tell that maybe someone is trying to set you up / revenge or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Offcourse all this differs from country to country and theyr methodics of working

     Just food for thought, and this really goes for everyone, in the event that you are contacted by Police, Customs, or any other LEO, the last place you should come seeking advice, is SR and/or it's forums. The reason being that you're basically identifying yourself in one way or another, potentially letting the LE that busted you know that you knew about the drugs. Think about it... maybe the local LE in your area is part of a larger joint task force that has been checking mail, and also checking here, bmr, etc. You posted exactly what was in your package, and when you went to the police... and what you told them...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the future if you get a letter, or call, or controlled delivery(that you spot/deny)from LE, maybe "read" the forums  as a last resort?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'd like to think that once people figured out they could order drugs online, their very next thought was to figure out how to be safe about receiving orders, and what to do when something get's seized. Do NOT just order, wait... not receive and then post details about the exact type and weight of your order on here. Especially if you're going to/have to go willy nilly into the police station to "See whats up", at that point you should DEFINITELY NOT then come back on here to 'confirm' the time-frame in which you were at the police station, being questioned. I think people over-estimate the safety of TOR and become ignorant to the information they give out to the masses.  :-X

    Though I wouldn't say it's a problem with TOR; TOR is working as advertised, hiding the origin of your traffic. As the [in]famous Gawker article pointed out, it's what you choose to share over TOR that kills you.
