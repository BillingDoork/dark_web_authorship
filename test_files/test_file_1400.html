    So we all know MBB's are very effective at preventing items in the post being smelled out, but obviously if a letter (an envelope seeming to contain just a letter or document) containing a MBB goes through some sort of x-ray machine there's going to be a noticeable black square in the envelope, which a postal service employee is unlikely to mistake for a business document.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Forgive me if I'm being stupid and some simple answer eludes me, but how can an MBB be better concealed in an envelope? All I can think of is sending a 'document pack' which contains enough paper to appear to be a fairly impenetrable block on x-ray, in which is hiding a packet of fun :P

    The question is.... how many of those million letters/packages every day do they actually X-ray? I believe domestic mail doesn't get X-rayed at all, mail within EU should also be rarely X-rayed. Even a ton of overseas mails arrives without problems, so I think overseas mail is the only thing that may get X-rayed every now and then.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could be all wrong though, that's just my theory using common sense =P

    MBB's don't block x-rays so they look similar to a plastic bag on a scan :)
    <br/>
    Most letter post doesn't get scanned,  but if the envelope is too big or bulky you just have to disguise your pack as one of the thousands of legit products that get foil packed and shipped around the world every day :)

    Not the foil ones, they are sealed with a pair of hair straighteners or a domestic clothes iron.
