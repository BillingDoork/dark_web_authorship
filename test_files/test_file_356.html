    I'll be europe next year, and i wanted to know if anyone has taken medicine back with them on the flight home?
    <br/>
    I would have it triple vaccum sealed and within my 'Checked-In' luggage with electronics on top and below package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone done this before? I'll be leaving from Italy. Would be great to hear of anyone's experiences...?
    <br/>
    Me personally i'd be cool as a cucumber and dont have a problem with it. :P

    I'm assuming you're talking about weed or something, not things like benzos or prescription drugs.  I don't think it's a great idea to put it in the checked baggage, despite vacuum sealing, since on an X ray it will show up as organic matter inside of plastic packaging which could seem suspicious and if it's perceived a big enough anomaly to warrant enough suspicion airport staff might open it up and look inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I was going to smuggle weed I'd always body pack it somehow, I brought just over an ounce with me once for a vacation which was vacuum sealed up a few times with a machine and then just strapped to my chest with duct tape.  It was still quite risky doing it like that because if I would have been patted down someone could have felt it, but I made sure to wear clothing with absolutely no metal bits anywhere so that the metal detector at least wouldn't go off.

    If you are bringing back pills I would recommend putting them in your carry on luggage in an empty prescription pill bottle.  I have brought back non controlled medications that require an script in the states but are available over the counter in Europe with no issue this way.  Weed or anything else I would think is not worth the risk.
