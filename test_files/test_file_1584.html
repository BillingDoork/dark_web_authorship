    Shouldn't be sketch, just depends on how your dorm mail system is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only issue I would see is the name on the package/mail not matching the residents of the dorm room.

    It's better to get a PO box off campus. You can be kicked out of school if you are caught with drugs on campus.

    I knew somebody who got 500g of MDMA from the netherlands to their college dorm every single week. Every morning when the mail is dropped off they would have to go down to the collection office and sign for their packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's only as sketch as the situation, or rather, no general situation is inherently sketchy, but you generally have to develop the ability to judge situations and analyze the variables in them, especailly when doing illegal things.

    If you were caught getting them mailed, I think getting kicked out of school would be the least of your worries.

    I think it is safer to order to regular addresses. College students would (in customs eye) be a huge part of the SR demographic.

    Someone I know went across the country to attend college, and he frequently complained of parcels vanishing. I've personally never had a package go missing (SR or legit), so I'd be hesitant to set up deliveries to a dorm.

    I did that with an oz a week or so and it was fine.  Make sure that your vendor has top knotch packaging.  If you get caught, you will be expelled.  On the contrary, college students are offered alot more "outs".

    There's usually nothing wrong with college post units.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The big deal is the address...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    College post offices are typically Contract Postal Units. They are typically given their own zip code and when addressing packages it is very important to follow the address format the college specifies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Typically it goes sort of like:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Attn: Addressee
    <br/>
    College Name
    <br/>
    Box Number
    <br/>
    1 Example Street
    <br/>
    Example, EX 00000 + (box#)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Each college is different and make sure you send some legit packages through the mail to make sure there aren't any troubles with things coming up missing for whatever reason. Always check your box and pick up your packages as soon as possible in the event of a conspicuous package. Always make sure the Addressee is the box holder. If the name does not match many automatically return the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've shipped to them and never had a problem.

    Imagine being the cocksucker stealing mail and you steal something only to open it and find a half key of MDMA. That's like winning the lottery right thur.

    As an ex-RA, I can tell you that the best way to get caught is to be stupid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was a pretty relaxed RA, but there were always those kids who thought it cool to smoke IN the dorms with no fucking barrier or anything. Then I'd have to intervene.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With packages, do your homework.  You need excellent stealth; with good stealth, your box looks nothing more than some junk a college student would order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now if you get the package, run upstairs, and suddenly the whole floor reeks of dank ::) And either your roomate doesn't know, or is fully in. Let there be know in-between.
