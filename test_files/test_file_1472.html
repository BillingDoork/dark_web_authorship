    A pink slip was left on the door at my house. My parents went to pick up and sign for the package that was for me and it turned out to be an ounce of mids I ordered almost two months ago. This obviously is not fucking good. Please tell me what I can do. I'm not a minor either.

    He stated that he is not a minor.  Seriously, this story doesn't make a lot of sense as stated in the OP ... lots of details missing.  Like, did they open the package?  How did they react?  What is the concern here?  Are the parents just angry, or are they turning the guy in?

    I have no idea how the fuck the signed for it. They said that it was a pink slip that just said there was a package that needed to be signed for and the went in and somehow signed for it. If you think that I'm some dumbass 15 year old, that's really not something I'm concerned with changing your mind about, I just need to know what precautions I can/should take.

    A)  Get a drop to have your gear sent to. (stop using mum and dads addy)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    B)  that slip should have had YOUR NAME on it and it's illegal for yhe post office to give parcels to someone other the the NAMED person on that pink slip....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    C)  Move out of your parents ?

    Your question as stated above makes no sense whatsoever.  You compound the problem by restating virtually the same question below without a stitch of clarification.  What can you do?  About what??

    LOL!!  That my good ChemCat....is nonsense.  The addressee may assign an "agent" to pick up the mail in their stead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if it wasn't allowed it would fall under USPS policy ..certainly not under a US Statute.
