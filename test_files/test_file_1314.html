    After spending a week of going from post office to post office it seems ive come into the same issue
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Me: Hello can i please get a dozen form 400's?
    <br/>
    teller: What are those?
    <br/>
    Me: DCN stickers, you know the tracking number sticker
    <br/>
    teller: We dont have those they are printed from a machine
    <br/>
    Me: Ok can you please give me form 135's then?
    <br/>
    teller: what are those?
    <br/>
    Me: the green DCN stickers
    <br/>
    teller: we dont have those, order them online
    <br/>
    Me: ok thank you for your time!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This sums up the issues, its not how it went but did repeat my fav line of bullshit
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do they give out the new form 400's or do you really need to order them off the net?
    <br/>
    have any of you asked to speak to a supervisor since these people are brain dead?
    <br/>
    does asking for a supervisor draw more attention to you?
    <br/>
    what past asking for the direct form # do you think i should say?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my current stock of 153's is almost out and i need more, i have no issue going to over 50 post offices even if i have to cross state lines but for the love of god 2 out of 30 places that ive gone to so far giving me what i want? ok help with my approach or just confirm im not alone and its brain dead people.

    Yep same experience here..I get the impression there just going phasing them out. Don't think it has anything to do with SR. It's just more cost efficient for people to use the USPS website to pay for shipping and you get the tracking included as well. For people that ship drugs that kinda sucks but I don't think that even crossed the USPS minds. It's all about budget. More ppl doing it online means less coming into the office, means less employees.

    have you tried to get a supervisor and if they are going to be phased out then what idea do we have for tracking on our orders?

    No I didnt bother because my PO is always so short on employees. I don't think I've ever seen a supervisor there. Like I said I think they won't be around for much longer just on my own theory so it would probably be wise to find a different method.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If we think about it and I'm just am average person shipping out something legal would I be trying so hard to get a DCN sticker or even know what that is? I really really doubt that. I thought the whole point is trying to blend your package with the crowd. So here we have the postmain taking out the contents of the mailbox and out of so the hundred boxes in there he finds one with a DCN sticker isn't that the opposite of blending your mail with the others when everyone else just prints the label online or drops it at the PO?

    They have them on stock but they're just too lazy to get them for you or don't even know what they are. If they tell you to order them online, tell them that on the website it says that you can get everything listed there in any post office.

    But come on man and don't get why people insist on poking the bee hive. Maybe I'm just smarted than your average postal worker but if someone came in and insisted on having those stickers even though they can get them online would make me wonder.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I was the PO employee this is what I would be thinking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So you saw on the website that you can get them here in the PO and you decieded to get in your car, drive here, and ask for them in person. Hmmmmmm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then you'd say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ya I was on my way home from work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which I'd say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sry don't know what green stickers you speak. Maybe try it on the website?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really don't understand the majority of the ppl's opinion on this subject. It's like your trying to raise attention. Not attention to a specific package but just general heat that you don't want. Each his own I guess.

    The post offices are being told to tell people to order the labels online.Â  Everything indicates that the gov't wants to be able to track the labels back to a person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your best bet might be to order online to a drop not connected to you.

    Yeah exactly but there's a lot of people on here that are trying to find a work around and still be able to get those stickers. If they're not going to be there any longer how are you going to get them?! lol
