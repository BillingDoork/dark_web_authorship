    I have 2 big international packages coming that I need to sign for and well lets just say its not a good time to have these come due to some other circumstances ......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you sign for a package and just dont open it then the police come to your house , they  cannot pin you with a crime , correct ??  I could just sign and let it sit there and if they ask questions just say I am not sure what it is was going to ask my roommate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice on what to do ??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I need the supplies in the package in a little bit but its not the time to be exposing myself for added heat.... in case what I think what is happening is happening .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was told that as long as you dont open it its a federal crime for the police to do so ...is this correct ?

    If you sign, it doesn't matter if it has been opened or not.  You signed and took possession of the narcotics.

    If you refuse it then it will go to the return address.  If you aren't home to receive it, then you can pick it up from the post office.  You still have to sign when you pick it up from the post office.

    FYI- If it's sent FedEx, you can leave a note on the door saying your not at home but leave it in a secret place for when you get home. (ie; under the front steps, etc.) The delivery person is allowed to except this as a signature. Think about it  :)

    Imo...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't sign, you're rejecting the package... the post office will return to sender, not hold it for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you sign... that alone is just a piece of evidence.  For example, what happens if your maid (if you had one) not knowing anything signed for it, would LE convict them?...  the maid was just doing their job.  So like what happens if a buddy was crashing at your place, you weren't home and the post man had a package for you?  Think LE could convict you or your buddy based on that?... idk.  It would sure make a more difficult case though.  If you have to sign, I'd say got this route perhaps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Failing to be home and having it sit at the post office wouldn't bring you any security I don't think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's your ass on the line, so it's your choice.  I personally wont order from any vendor requiring a signature.

    If I was in this situation and I KNEW IN ADVANCE that I had to sign for the packages, I would act like I have a surprised reaction to the package being delivered,  probably sign, then, with a black sharpie marker write "UNKNOWN SENDER/RETURN TO SENDER" and leave it outside for 2-3 days (in a place where the postman won't see it)...Then again, I don't know your situation exactly, but this is what I'd do probably. Plausible Deniability, you never opened it, yes you signed for it but didn't even look at the sender's address when you signed, but when you realized you didn't know the sender you decided to take action and return the package since you don't know who the sender is

    I had this very same question, thinking of ordering something international to europe. I can choose 4 packages or 1 signed for which would be alot easier. However I try to use a fake name and different address where possible for international so it complicates matters somewhat. Decisions decisions. For your question though, if theres heat on you, is it too late to cancel or are they already in transit? have you had some other packets intercepted or something?

    <br/>
    Curious how do you pick a drop location or address ???

    I hear about this all the time but  always am weary of picking a for sale house sign out of the ground and then waiting for the shipment ...otherwise its just gotta be a friend of yours willing to help you out ...any advice for future would be good ?

    Dollar value does not matter. I did message the vendor I just wanted to know if anyone else had this problem.

    Signing in someone elses name is not an option to my best knowledge. Im pretty sure they make you show id.

    I have a hard time believing that USPS cares as much as you think they do about possible drugs being sent through the mail. They are bankrupt and can barely handle regular mail let alone check for drugs. The only stories I've heard of with controlled deliveries is people sending pounds of weed through the mail without vacuum sealing and trying to store it in peanut butter or cans etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been buying things online since the 90s and have signed for a lot of stuff and it's not as complicated as you think. The mailman knocks on my door and asks if I'm who the package was address to and I say yes then he has me sign a piece of paper and then he leaves. They never ask for ID and I've even had friends sign for me without my consent just because they were over that day. They used their own name but said that they were a friend of mine and that I was at work blah blah.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been shipping drugs through the mail for a long time too. Just a few days ago I mailed some MDMA to a friend 2 states away like usual in person and it was delivered 3 days later without issue. I've done this so many times I've lost count. I've also ordered off here to my house in my name over 100 times and only had 2 orders go missing.

    Previous poster anon911 is correct (and congrats on post # 500, Hero!).  USPS is understaffed and although there are some great, hard working people behind the counter... quite a few are simply trying to get their ticket punched and cash in after they put in their time.  The recent squawking from the Postmaster General and some in Govt really highlights the bad relationship between USPS and Congress, their source of funding.  USPS doesn't have enough money to operate, always wants more, but can't enact the 'proper' changes without Congressional approval.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In short, the predicament that the USPS is currently embroiled in is great for sending illicit substances through the mail.  I go as far to say that many workers are disenchanted with their jobs and are giving even less of a fuck.  If you do your due diligence and research the process and ways to protect yourself [and you really should, so your drug mail doesn't look/smell/feel like the bottom barrel of mailed drugs (and thus picked out of the line and examined/opened)], you'll soon begin to understand a lot of what I've just typed. ~RP
