    Hi guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm buying a small amount of PED's, Basically I'm wondering if there is no mention of stealth packaging on the sellers item page, does that mean they don't stealth it or is it just common etiquette around here that it doesn't need to be mentioned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example - An item I'm looking at buying says it's packed in a sealed pill bottle with the drugs name on the side. Now these drugs are illegal in a lot of countries, hence why we are purchasing them on here lol. Wouldn't it be in the seller's best interest to try and stealth pack the PED's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just want the best chance possible through Australian customs lol, the way I look at it, buying it from an Aussie seller is obviously safer but 3-4 times more expensive. So I'd rather take a chance ( or three ) to get it through customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can any sellers or buyers from Australia weigh in here if you have received or successfully sold/delivered any PED's in pill bottles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance!

    If your order is coming in a bottle full of pills/tabs (and I imagine you are buying at least 100 tabs, otherwise why bother?), it will get flagged by customs. There's a reason prices are so expensive locally because people don't have the option to reliably buy from O/S.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know of cases where small spray bottles have been sent and the package has been opened so a bottle of pills is just asking for trouble.

    Thanks for the input Rocket :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah I was looking to get over 100tabs, I can see how it would be flagged easily, was kinda wondering how some sellers would stealth that amount in a bottle. The safest way I thought would be multiple envelopes spreading the order out, but then I guess some people may be disgruntled with the fact that it's not a sealed bottle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh well, a bit more research to do I guess. Maybe i'll find a nicely priced local seller.

    Hey Cats,
    <br/>
    I cycle a couple of times a year so know what a frustrating game it can be to get good quality steroids. I can honestly say 98% of anything in a glass vial or amp will get seized by Aus Customs. I was so desperate at one point for HCG that I ordered it from 8 different overseas sources from different parts of the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every single package was going to a different address and was under a different name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ONE single ampule of hcg made it past Customs! It was at that point I promised myself Id buy everything but my pct and anti e drugs in Aus. It took some time but I found a good UGL, they even had HCG when I needed it too.
    <br/>
    Buying roids from OS is like throwing your hard earned cash in the fire,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Message me if you need a good OS source for your PCT and anti estrogen needs : )
    <br/>
