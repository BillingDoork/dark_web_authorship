    Hey SR,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Question: What is the longest wait time that you have experienced receiving regular First Class International Mail from NL to US (no signature required)? Are two of my drops flagged now?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Details:
    <br/>
    I am on day 20 for a fairly large order from an NL vendor. I had him split the order up into 4 different packages to be delivered to 4 different addresses. The first arrived on day 12 and the second on day 14. It seems strange that each of the remaining two packages would take this long to arrive. Of the two packages that did arrive, the vendor's packaging definitely seemed legit enough to successfully make it through. I have a feeling that he is selectively scamming and never sent the other two packages at all. After all, what are the odds that half of the packages came through without a hitch and the other half were seized. I mean, there is a small chance that one of them could have been seized, but two? He is a fairly new vendor and has received mixed reviews. On the one side, people love his service, his product, and his packaging and then, there are the few that just don't receive their orders (selective scamming?). Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.   :)

    23 days when there were 4 packages that all arrived at different times from the same order. One was 10 and the final was 23. I was nervous as hell and FE instead of going to auto-finalize. When it arrived we let the good times roll. Keep in mind some vendors will drive to different post offices and they also space the days out to not be too frequent.

    For me shipments from the NL have never taken long, but a friend of mine was stuck waiting for 18+ days on one of his orders.
