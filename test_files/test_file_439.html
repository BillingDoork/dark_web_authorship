    I always kick myself after ordering and THEN checking the forums. FFS
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So is djabber reliable? I just placed an order with him also. His feedback seems good but theres always going to be a few bad reports no matter, I hope its no problem though!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone know if he uses the forum?

    Just to let the OP and sup3rm4n know, djabbar is frequently noted as sending packages out late, often a few days after they've been put 'in transit'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Judging from his feedback, there is also a not insignificant number of people that do not receive their packages - whether this is due to customs (as the packages are sent from NL, and therefore checked more frequently than packages from other most other countries) or due to djabbar not actually sending them is a question nobody but djabbar knows the answer to.

    Thanks for the info GG.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I appreciate it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope this order comes through. I tried out a few NL vendors and all of my packages arrived in good time, around the time I was guessing they would so I hope this one is no different.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I plan on making it every fortnight, so having to find a decent NL vendor is on my list and I thought djabber was the guy to try after reading his amnesia listing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The suspense is killing me already, I had to order 2g off a uk seller to see me through lol  :o

    I think that djabbar doesn't make this stupid things else he should have refused to resend with tracking code. I still received nothing...

    Hopefully theres no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Out of the last 10 feedback scores there has only been one bad mention.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also the last 10 feedbacks have been written less than a day ago so he must be a well used vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have faith

    A buddy of mine ordered an ounce off djabbar a few months ago, and never received anything.  He felt he got scammed because he never received a customs letter and he's ordered successfully a bunch of times from other vendors based in NL.  I hope you guys have better luck, personally I haven't ordered from him as my friend's experience was enough to put me off.

    I have had some experience with djabbar.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered 200g of hash for $630 USA shipping with track and trace. The package was intercepted by US customs. By the time the package was intercepted the transaction had been in SR resolution with an extension. After about a week djabbar agreed to reship for free. When he agreed I finalized. After I finalized he told me that he shipped the package but he just used the regular post instead of tracking. I found this hard to believe but I waited and about 6 days later I got a 196g bar of hash. Djabbar was honest with me and he worked out some issues we had. His 200g plagues are a few Gs short but no biggie
