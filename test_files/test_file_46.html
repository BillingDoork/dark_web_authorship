    I want to become a vendor here, and i could really do with some help. If you want you could pm as to not reveal too much, but i need help on how to package and ship effectively, and also places where i could purchase the packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's best padded envelopes or normal ones? How to vac an heat seal packages?Where to get the equipment to do so ? I'm stuck.
    <br/>

    I'm from the UK also if that helps. Any tutorials or anything would be helpful.

    Hey man, welcome to Silk Road. The more UK dealers the better! I'm not a vendor, but from my experiences as a buyer, this is what most vendors tend to do with weed (and probably other drugs):
    <br/>
    a) Put the weed in a normal baggie. Not all vendors do this, but I like it, as weed sticks to the inside of vac-seal bags like you wouldn't believe! It's also very helpful if you write on the strain name, as it helps to keep track of what's what if the buyer has ordered more than one strain, or from more than one vendor.
    <br/>
    b) Vac seal 1-3 times, normally twice. Not sure how much multiple vac-sealing helps, but I doubt it hurts! I'm not sure where you'd buy the equipment, but I know happyhippy has some bags for sale (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e4b911fb1c)
    <br/>
    c) Place the vac-sealed weed in something to disguise it. An envelope is sometimes used, as that obviously stops visual identification, but it still feels like weed if you squeeze it! Mostly it's put in some kind of container or a cd/dvd/blu-ray case to hide the shape as well.
    <br/>
    d) Put the whole thing in an envelope. Normal envelopes seem to be sturdy enough, but jiffy envelopes are a bit more squidgy and hard to feel or see through, and seem to seal more securely as well.
    <br/>
    e) Print the address (don't handwrite) and send it off!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think that's about it. I've never had a UK to UK package not get through, as all the (reputable) vendors on here package like this, and it seems to do the job.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck, hope to see your stuff for sale on here soon!
