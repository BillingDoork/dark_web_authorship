    I ordered a package Wednesday and selected overnight option. Vendor said the USPS said delivery by 12/1/12 but when I searched the TN it showed check in, sorting, then a depart from sorting facility on 11/29 and no other posts at all. Shouldn't there have been some kind of "checked in at ___ " on 11/30?  Nothing posted on 11/30 at all so I'm getting worried!  I thought overnight ment overnight but the shipping option was express mail guaranteed by 12/1/12 and I had to pay $20 for what I thought would b overnight. Also can the USPS see who checks tracking #'s?  I checked from my iphone and computer today.

    when you check packages like that you give up plausible deniability. so picking up the package and writing "return to sender" on it and waiting to open it for a day or so is now off the table since it's obvious you are expecting the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sometimes postal workers do not scan packages and that could easily be what happened here.

    If it said depart from sorting facility that probably means it's on its way to where you are. If you live something like coast to coast it has a long way to travel so thats when it wouldn't be updated for the longest amount of time.
    <br/>
    Too bad it didn't show up today!  ???
    <br/>
    Thats strange though, if you said you paid for overnight on wed. but yet the vendor says that it comes by 2/1. If thats the case, I always give it an extra day. When you look on usps they always tell you expected by ____ but it always shows up for me a day later.
    <br/>
    AND it was just cyber monday!
    <br/>
    If expected delivery was by 2/1 id give till monday or tuesday before i'd get worried.

    USPS does some crazy shit.  I placed an order last week and gave the vendor my address.  The vendor actually questioned the address i gave him because he thought it might be incomplete.  I assured him it wasn't and i had used it several times.  Anyway USPS put it in another box to store it because the office at this place was closed for the holiday on a Saturday.  The USPS man was the only one with access to this box.  He then took MON and Tues off the next week and didn't tell his replacements what he had done.  I caught up with him on Wed and he gave me the package.  In the time between SAT and WED he never updated the tracking, the vendor chewed my ass up on side and down the other, the vendor threatened to bash me on the vendor forum.  Meanwhile, i'm sitting here with no package getting treated like an asshole.  The vendor ultimately apologized for their behavior and cancelled the order which resulted in a full refund for me.  When i got the package i PM'd the vendor and offered to send them the coins.  They haven't replied for days.  Anyway, my point is USPS does some crazy shit and there is no way of predicting what will happen.  The only thing you can do is order way in advance of actually needing anything.  That way if shit hit's the fan you have time to go through the process at least two more times before you actually need your product.  Best of Luck i know how you feel.
