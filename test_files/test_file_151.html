    Hello fellow travelers,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For a while now I've been thinking about trying some shrooms and of course I would order them from SR.  So far I've only bought pharmaceuticals from SR and felt pretty safe because it's not like they really train dogs or people to smell for pills right?  My question is; can drug dogs smell shrooms?  Do they even give off a scent like bud does?  If so how are shrooms normally packaged to contain this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance for the help!

    I think dogs trained to smell shrooms may be impractical, they probably do exist for specialized busts but not for the postal system. essentially they would be smelling fungus/earth/vermiculite and rye grain... There are many legal types of mushroom shipped every day, think shitake, and a million other specialist ones that are not available in many places that are shipped in individual orders.. I would say its possible as all things, but unlikely. Especially seeing as a scent dogs needs 4 years to be trained I think for a particular scent, and shrooms were still legal less than that in europe.. Hundreds were shipped from amsterdam legaly..

    mush-e-mart.com now wholcelium used to have these nifty little envelopes with a silica lining, they used to dry out the shrooms whilst shipping. SO put in wet shrooms one end, when the buyer opens them they´re pretty much perfectly dry!

    Dogs CAN be trained to smell shrooms.
    <br/>
    So can pigs.
    <br/>
    Pigs were used for years to sniff out truffles.
    <br/>
    Only "recently" have they been replaced by dogs.
    <br/>
    Pigs apparently have an issue with eating the truffles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dried mushrooms are shipped across the world everyday. It would be a HUGE waste of any ones time for a dog to "flag" every package that contains any mushroom content at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the question becomes:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can dogs smell the "actives"?
    <br/>
    Can they even be trained to smell the actives?
    <br/>
    How may years does that take?
    <br/>
    How much $ does it cost?
    <br/>
    How often would a dog that is properly trained to smell actives be "useful"?
    <br/>
    How many packages of "uber illegal shrooms " would that dog have to "catch" before it would be worth the time and money to train it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    .....feel the answer is obvious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do not not REALLY know the answer to these questions...but in asking them and pondering the answers I think it is fair to hypothesis that this is not a big issue. For you or anyone else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    with that said.....make sure your vendor always uses a vac packer, and you should now be able to sleep at night ;)
