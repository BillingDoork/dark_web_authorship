    As I get the Grand Wizard's Lair set up, I'm seeing a great deal of demand from my drug-using friends in the other hemisphere.  I've been led to believe that shipping to Oz and New Zealand is difficult because customs are strict and mail gets a pretty close once-over.  But I also see that a few non-Aussie vendors have managed to successfully ship Down Under.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any Aussies or Kiwis willing to offer advice on how one might get small quantities of 2c-s, methylone or similar non-smelly powders past the ever-watching eye of the customs man?  I'm guessing that poppy straw or cannabis edibles would be challenging but I'm thinking a few capsules of 2c-b or 2c-t-7 or a couple grams of M-1 might be doable.  And where the Grand Wizard has a will he always finds a way:  Igor and I are hoping to take this consciousness alteration franchise worldwide.

    I've purchased over 10 international orders to Australia. Products from NL, India, China never made it through. Everything from USA and UK were fine. Personally I would stick with powders and not caps.

    Keep it simple and stick to small packages of powders, less than 2g/shipment has been safe for me thus far.  The only issues I've had are packages from NL.  Also lost a shipment from MIN in Canada just before he/she got bust.  Ive received plenty of international shipments that would (I assume) just blend in with the vast mail volume arriving.
    <br/>
    Good Luck.

    was the shipment to your real name/address? if so what did you do? nothing? Jut curious because ive had one from spain not turn up months ago but nothing happened, im guessing the vendor didst send it though cos he pulled his listing and went into stealth a day after he "sent" it.

    only plain white envelopes will slip thru. everything else you run the risk of flagging your mail box. Also don't order from the same country less than 10 weeks apart. If you have one package intercepted don't use the address again. Stay safe and don't get greedy, and you might just make the long haul.

    only plain white envelopes  &amp; 10 weeks apart ?   ;D

    I would love to know how you came to these two conclusions

    10 weeks thing seems bogus, people with relatives/business interests would be sending far more often than that, and there's no way its all getting checked.

    I'm beginning to develop a theory that the plain whites are great though, just from personal experience.

    Yeah, the inconspicuous letters are the go. Just think of the amount coming from some countries, no chance of being picked up. Lol at the 10wks rule. My bank account would certainly appreciate it!

    I've sent acid and mdma to Oz many times, and not yet had a letter not get through. Just be smart about sending it.
