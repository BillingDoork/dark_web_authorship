    Hi everyone
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm hitting up a couple of festivals in Croatia this year and I want to post some goodies over to myself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anybody had any successful or unsuccessful attempts with sending stuff over to Croatia?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the moment I'm thinking doubled vacuum sealed bags hidden in an ear or headphone box, with the headphones still in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to send it to the campsite I'll be staying in. One thing is I'll have to put my real name on it as they'll ask for ID when I collect it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts/tips?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers

    Sounds dodgy man. Mainly the real name part and campsite. It will be a little suspicious with the amount of drugs coming into the country around the time of those festivals. You would be best of with a fake name sent to a villa if you know anyone staying in one.

    I wouldn't do it to the campsite man thats sketchy shit, if you have booked a apartment for a festival maybe post it there but personally I still wouldn't chance it. The croatian police are pretty brutal especially on Brits who have come over for a festival/ holiday, heard some horror stories about people spending the nights in cells and having to pay large bribes while I was at outlook. One of my only experiences of people getting drugs to Croatioan festivals is a mate of mine who drives K down as liquid and cooks it up in a apartment but obviously this isn't a option to most people.

    yeah the old rose water k method! mix your k with flavoured water the end of product maybe a little harsher too sniff and smell of strawberries roses or whatever is in the water but its a good technique when driving. Or you put in inside your tyres.

    What are you taking?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Probably best just to keep it on you and take it on the plane or coach etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have taken drugs on planes quite a few times and never had a problem. I can give you advice if you choose to use this method :)
