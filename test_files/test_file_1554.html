    Basically, I've got 50 pills coming from Netherlands and my friend has just told me there has been a couple of people who imported 200 pills and got caught.. I live in quite a small town and it's made me think that they're going to open all packages coming from the Netherlands?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I worrying too much? Also what is the best thing to do in this situation where I may get caught?

    Depending on what country you're in, "they" (i.e., postal workers or LE in your town) may not be allowed to just open any packages they feel like, whether they're from NL or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd clean my house if I were you, and possibly your computer equipment too depending on what you do with it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it arrives, assume it could be a controlled delivery. If you're arrested, keep your mouth shut. There are entire threads on this forum devoted to what you should do in the event of either of these things happening - I suggest you read them.

    Do you know if there's anything such a controlled delivery in EU?
    <br/>
    I think it's something for US
