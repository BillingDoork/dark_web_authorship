    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will be going on a trip to Thailand sometime in the future, and I had this idea of smuggling a very small amount of drugs over on the plane.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. I'm only going to bring 2 white speakers (Supertrips) with me. Would that be a 'safe' amount? I will probably put the speakers in caps, then a ziplock, then a rubbermaid, rinsing with isopropyl at every step.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. How detectable would 2 20mg 2CB caps be? I was also planning to smuggle those for the 4+ hour redose :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In total it would be a small-time smuggle, only 4 caps. But if people here think it's too dangerous, I will just go for booze there instead. Thoughts?

    Hmmm - as for the 2C-B, I know it's absolutely NOT detectable by doggies and the such. So theoretically if you hide it well enough you will have no problems. Just don't walk through the airport holding it in your hand and you should be fine!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Same pretty much goes for the MDMA - 2 - 4 caps should be no problem at all. IMO it won't be. But if you are nervous, you can always ship it beforehand, this is a technique that always works. Just send it to where you would be staying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's my advice, I've smuggled things domestically, and I think overseas should be more or less the same with no smellable product  :)

    I'd just ship it. I used to smuggle, and I did everything in my power to avoid going through airports with drugs. If one unexpected little thing goes wrong, you're fucked. I've gone through airports four times with drugs, and everytime something could have happened that could have exposed me, and however unlikely that may have been, it's still something that can be avoided by shipping it to where you'll be staying.

    I actually just smuggled MDMA through an airport last week. I was only flying to the next state over howevere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I took an old prescription bottle still full of the capsules( i didnt take the prescription) emptied the capsules, filled them with mdma, and popped the capsules back in the script bottle. noone noticed a thing. This was in my carry-on bag.

    The idea of shipping it sounds good, but I don't have any sort of stealth packaging to offer for the package's protection. I will only be going for a couple of days too, so I will have to ship it at least a week before yes? Is shipping such small quantities even worth it, I wonder?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My country's airport security isn't stringent at all (no dogs), but I'm not sure about Thailand's security. I think I could get away with such small quantities but I'd like more opinions on the matter first.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On a second note, any vendors want to sell me low quantities of drugs for my holiday? :)

    Just remember the Thais are conducting a pretty harsh WoD at the moment; its been a while since I was there so I can't comment on current airport security.  But if you are thinking of posting, take into account very long delivery times....I've been let down by Poste Restantes a few times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the heady days of the mid-nineties when airports were easy, friendly places SWIM took things all over Asia...eg, ten pills into Malaysia complete with signs at the airport saying "drug mules are beheaded".  Those days are over sadly (the easy airports not the beheading). ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd suggest going to Cambodia...quieter, cheaper, nicer people, much more relaxed about...well, everything.  You can buy anything you want in Sihanvoukville.

    Thailad is famous for draconian laws against drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However on any beach drug dealers will offer you to buy hashish or shrooms. They say they have opium (I did not buy). The quality of the product is poor if you buy on the beach and it is always rip-off (shopping in Thailad is often a rip-off, cause they are asians, you know). But it is possible to find a great hash in Thailand for a good price. There is also 'Fool moon partyl' every month on Ko-Phangan. I guess you can buy MDMA or some other 'trans-party drugs' there.

    u will be fine. if ur travelling via air asia, id assume. Syd/Melb/Perth -&gt; KL -&gt; BKK or USM. basically no customs at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    even if ur flying 'premium' should be fine if ur taking 1 or 2 pills. planning to take bout 4-5 caps of mdma and few caps with coke in it to SEA in the future. i dont see why they would stop an traveller with an Australian passport unless ur shitting ur pants or acting dodgy.

    Go-go dancers and 2C-B.  Life doesn't get much better than that, my friend.  You're a lucky dog.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As to your question, I wouldn't worry about such a small amount.  Just throw them in with some other pills you are traveling with, like tylenol or whatever, and you'll be fine.  Nobody cares about your 2 tabs of ecstasy.

    well put it this way... a thai jail cell is about 5m x 5m... and has 20-50 people in it at any one time. There is a bucket in the corner to shit in yuo all have to share You get one meal of slop a day, but the rest of your food has to be purchased from the canteen by an outsider putting money in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A menial charge of a few gs if caught will get you anything between 3-10 years...

    I am specifically heading to Phuket, so are customs there any good? It's not going to be a few g's of stuff, just 400mg MDMA + 40mg 2C-B. While the laws are pretty draconian and there is a pretty big anti-drug campaign going on, I'm wondering about the safety of bringing such small amounts in. So far the responses have all been positive, and I'm getting a bit excited for the trip.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone have any other recommendations on stealth packaging for on-board flight smuggling?

    That's pretty clever. With some pretty pure powdered product, you could pack a decent amount in there. I might have to give this a shot, thanks for sharing that tip mate.

    The thing is do you take those highlighters/markers on international flights? My trip to Phuket would be considered as an international flight (int. airports at destination). I'm not scared of leaving the country, just arriving in Thailand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, is 2cb detectable by dogs and all that? I'm pretty sure MDMA would be. Do MDMA molecules leak from glass? I just came up with a sealing plan yesterday involving vials and bleach...

    I am sorry for hijacking your thread but I was going to ask the same exact question and I am still looking to hear some suggestions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am going to take a domestic flight in Italy next week, I wont be going to any big (main) airport, and I was thinking about taking a 3 grams of mdma with me. I will have a handbag carrying my computer as well as a luggage with some clothes and sheets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So far I have been thinking on two options, one is to crack it in small pieces and to put it into a single pain killers bag  and throw it along with a dozen of other pain killers bags in their package and put it in the luggage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other option is to put it in my arse? But how? Would the dog or any sort of scanner see it? As far as I know none of the airports I will be going have any body scanner.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have never done anything like that so I'm looking for some advice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Well that would depend on your airport's security. Every country has different standards, and typically for domestic flights those standards are very low. Do you just walk to security and go through with just an x-ray? Do you get scanned upon arrival? Are there dogs (even if it's just once a week) in the airport?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's my plan for the Phuket trip, please let me know if you think it's a good idea:
    <br/>
    1. Make the capsules first. Bag them in seranwrap with clean hands, then bag those in a brand new ziplock (small one).
    <br/>
    2. Place capsules into a small glass vial
    <br/>
    3. Place glass vial into bleach or some other solution to burn out any stray molecules (make sure the damn thing is sealed!)
    <br/>
    4. Take out vial on the day of flight, stuffing it into my carry on somehow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some concerns:
    <br/>
    1. Is glass easily detectable by an x-ray? I'll probably be using a small glass vial that can fit 4-6 caps in it.
    <br/>
    2. Are individual capsules easily picked up by x-rays? If they are I might just split it into two vials instead of just one.

    Mochill, please post us from Thailand to tell if it was successful :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think generally it is good. I'd rather take the vial with me in a handbag: security will have less time to detect anything. It's very hard to see small details on their X-ray screen. The only real danger is sniffing detectors.

    I think that drugs of any kind through airports is a huge unnecessary risk. If something goes wrong, you're fucked. And you're not just fucked, you're fucked in a foreign country, which is like fucked squared. There are drugs in any country, and I would just try and find something in the country you're going to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you still think that the benefits outweigh the risks though (and that's something which only you can decide upon), I would suggest finding a bottle of vitamins which come in capsules, empty a couple of them (and mark them in some way), then fill them with your molly. Given that it will only be 2/3/4 capsules out of a whole bottle, it's unlikely they will be detected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, apart from concealment, a very important thing would be to not stand out in any way while you're in line at security in the first place. Don't act nervously or differently in any way from other people. In other words, don't look like you're carrying drugs and they won't have any reason to perform "random" checks on you. I would guess that dressing up rather than down would help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've never done any of the above myself (as I said, I see it as a huge risk), so please take my advice for what it is.

     The thing is do you take those highlighters/markers on international flights? My trip to Phuket would be considered as an international flight (int. airports at destination). I'm not scared of leaving the country, just arriving in Thailand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also, is 2cb detectable by dogs and all that? I'm pretty sure MDMA would be. Do MDMA molecules leak from glass? I just came up with a sealing plan yesterday involving vials and bleach...

    Bro, you are really over thinking this.  Just put the caps/tabs into a bottle of regular pills, put the cap on tightly, and throw it into your carry on bag.  They are not going to be sicking the dogs on you at the airport in Thailand.  If you were talking about smuggling quantity, it would be a whole different story.  But for a few pills of ecstasy and bees?  Don't worry about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW, maybe you wouldn't mind stopping by Nana Plaza for me to tell this girl Noi that I miss her?  I really do miss her.

    This - locked up abroad scared me straight  8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Real talk tho back when I was on that other shit I shot dope a few times in an airplane from newark to somewhere in louisianna, I was high as fuck getting on the plane too. They screened the Islams standing next to me in line tho, that' for sure ah hah ha. So I'm in the bathroom fixing up a dope shot, and the stewardass comes up and asks if I need help (cause I told her I had diabetes) or some shit like that, I was all xannied out, and I said "Nah" and went back to finding a vein at 40,000 feet and I hit it then I went back to sleep at my seat. Good times. I wouldn't advise it, but it's very possible. This was domestic tho. I bet I could get a hand grenade onto an airplane. Smiling goes a long way. That xanax confidence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know how that helps you, but that's my story. Is it real? I don't know, but I have lied in the past.

    Gambino - I over think a lot of things but in this case I'm really just getting as much information as I can :) Everyone should always research their drugs fully. More so if the research is about smuggling!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've thought up of a new method of smuggling my stuff. I think I'm definitely going to go through with this because the potential for fun is just too great to ignore. I'll update this whenever I get back! I'm pretty sure I'll be back :O
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please do continue to post information about your smuggling practices, especially concerning Thai customs. Does anyone have a good description of what happens once you touch down in Phuket airport? That would be especially helpful.

    Always carry your drug on you and not in your luggage of any sort. Security can check your bag without you knowing it, TSA can open the pill bottle and question you making you nervous and suspicious, the highlighter idea is great but you never know if TSA is not gonna go crazy and forbid you to take it aboard. (i've seen crazy stuff happening, TSA forcing people to leave behind some items that weren't suspicious at all). Many times my carry on bag has been searched past the scanner because they thought they saw something suspicious, and they open and check everything. If the guy is in a bad mood he could find your vials or pills and decide to play with you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once, i was controlled in my car, and the cops were in a really bad mood. They found a bottle of ginger pills (to help digestion, very good before shrooming). They got suspicious and decided to take me to the station, letting me  hand cuffed for 4 hours, the time for  the test kit to arrive at the station. So....be careful with that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Put a tight underpant, and stick your baggies in it at your balls level. They don't necessarily like to rub your balls upon checking. This is one of the last place they will check. If you're searched here, it means they are already suspicious, and pretty much fucked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My 2 cents.

     Well that would depend on your airport's security. Every country has different standards, and typically for domestic flights those standards are very low. Do you just walk to security and go through with just an x-ray? Do you get scanned upon arrival? Are there dogs (even if it's just once a week) in the airport?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Here's my plan for the Phuket trip, please let me know if you think it's a good idea:
     <br/>
     1. Make the capsules first. Bag them in seranwrap with clean hands, then bag those in a brand new ziplock (small one).
     <br/>
     2. Place capsules into a small glass vial
     <br/>
     3. Place glass vial into bleach or some other solution to burn out any stray molecules (make sure the damn thing is sealed!)
     <br/>
     4. Take out vial on the day of flight, stuffing it into my carry on somehow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some concerns:
     <br/>
     1. Is glass easily detectable by an x-ray? I'll probably be using a small glass vial that can fit 4-6 caps in it.
     <br/>
     2. Are individual capsules easily picked up by x-rays? If they are I might just split it into two vials instead of just one.

    I am pretty sure there are no body scanners installed to those airport I will be passing through.. Also I am not a foreign as I am Italian citizen .. So I am not that concerned about them possibly scanning my body, not even a body search will give them any result since I am hiding it in my butt ..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The big question here is... Are dogs able to feel mdma??? I have been told they are not.. But I am really scared about that..

    The thing is I'm not going through American TSA. I'm going through Asian TSA, where the people manning the xray are typically not interested in what goes through. Wouldn't it be worse if drugs were found ON ME rather than in my bag?

    Latrina - If you are hiding it in your butt using a condom up your rectum, then you should be okay. If you are just hiding something between your asscrack, I suggest finding a way of sealing the MDMA before doing so. You should be fine since you are a citizen flying a domestic flight.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dogs can detect MDMA (any concentration can be detected) but if you aren't bringing a lot of stuff with you, the dogs will typically ignore you for a variety of reasons. They are tired, are trained to go for the big shots, or they just aren't there. I think you will be OK. Post back after you try!

    Not something I'd ever try, but met a guy who took MDMA to Thailand. He said he mixed the caps up with his multivitamins (I guess they looked the same?). He said the problem was that by the time he got to his hotel they had all melted together.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why not save yourself the stress and just buy one of the magic mushroom shakes there?

    You sure dogs wont react if they smell small quantity of something passing through? Cuz my friend in paris airport was been hold for a whole night because dogs reacted badly at him, and he just forgot a ganja of hash among with his cigs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways I am still in doubt of what I should do with this mdma, whether ship or carry it with me, but in the case I'll decide to bring it with me I'll definitely stick it up in my ass on a condom.. It's just 3 grams of mdma, shouldn't be that uncomfortable. :D
