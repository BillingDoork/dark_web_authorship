    i wish i knew more details. after speaking with my bud he said he did previous order from this vendor and it went fine. then this new order which was considerably more money wasn't as lucky. also according to tracking number you can see it was clearly shipped but then it just stops and says "please contact &lt;shipping company&gt;". so who knows. i actually told my bud that he be better off if it was a scam. how could someone manipulate a shipping company or whatever? who knows.

    If it says "please contact &lt;us&gt;", it was probably seized. At this stage, LE would be looking for unintelligent buyers to reach out to the shipping company to ask about where their package is, at which stage a controlled delivery, or even possibly just a sting, would be set up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other hand, and I personally feel this is less likely given the information you have ostensibly presented, but it could be simply a vendor who does selective scams. In fact, if one were to consider it heavily, a methodology that could be used is when a large order comes in, super-insecure packaging methods would be used and some product, just enough to get it seized, would be included. In this case, the vendor could profit even with a 50% refund given.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So yeah... your order is fucked either way. I just hope you aren't fucked, yourself. Sign for nothing. Don't even answer the door... unless it is about to be busted in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay safe. And if you can, take the package into the resolution center. Since the supposed issue is with the package getting seized, that means the vendor is the one who fucked up(in theory), so I personally think a 100% refund would be fair. :)

    All he had to do was ship out some nugs not vac sealed or anything to some random address with a random return address.

    Then he gives you the "dummy dcn" and you read it, you think LE has your drop and parcel, but really this dude is just sitting back banging the H you just bought off of him.

    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32819.msg373730#msg373730   I just spent two hours defending myself  in a nearly identical thread started by this SAME OP! FYI The 'buddy' who did a successful order and the large order had the problem? I was nice enough to give her 50% of her loot right away and so far she has not held up her end of the bargain so now I'm out hundreds of dollars of dope as it is with no access to the money I'm entitled to. Not saying she's gonna steal it just saying I ain't a scammer probably cuz i wouldn't be able to live with myself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Really though. all yall haters quick to cry scam or narc please read the real story in this op's identical thread i linked to above. then I'll expect an apology from all yall. FYI Not 1 single package got confiscated by LE. 1 Jackass named pyrat13 freaked out and handed his local sheriff his but the other 3 were snagged in the sorting facility just like the op says in his 2nd or 3rd post. I earns my scrilla It's easy when you treat people right and fair. Which brings me to the price thing that smart-ass smokeweed420 brought up AGAIN I've been shut down cuz of this fucking asshole handing his drugs to the cops outside his house so I havent adjusted prices since the BTC was 7something so "NO" I Don't charge 250/gram for tar (just jokin with ya 420 i ain't mad atcha) I'll field any questions anyone wants to ask, I'll defend all my actions. I invite all challenges to my integrity. I only ask that you read this guy's other thread first cuz the whole story is really over there.

    And  FUCK ALL YALL FER REAL YO! Most of yall have colored shit by your name that usually indicates you been doin something right. Well it sure as shit ain't RESEARCH. How the fuck are all yall just gonna assume I'm pulling a scam or scams? Based on what? Not facts. I'm the only one who knows the facts and ain't  nary a one a yas PM me? Is this a community or is it every man for himself? Cuz I been lookin out for brothers. I got more positive support from the ones who's orders got flagged honestly. I ain't lookin for sympathy from ya but God damn you're just gonna write a mother fucker off without a shred of evidence? really? Everytime something goes missing it's a scam every time?

    I am just curios how people know about all this in detail. How did clipped off safety know the dude handed it over the cops, flagged other packages, etc. Was he witness to this, read it in the paper, kid told him after bail? Not hating, just trying to understand. I see a large amount of this sometime. Or reputable vendors who somehow get back on after they were caught we 2 kilos. Miraculous intel or have partners speaking for them. What the dirty on it?

    From the other post ClippedUp linked to it sounds like the buyer complained to Clipped saying he never got his package. Clipped saw the DCN said it was delivered and then pressed the buyer about what really happened to it, then the buyer realized, "Oh, I gave that package to the LEO that has been sitting outside my house for the last week since I didn't know what it was."  :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course the LEO found the product in the package that the buyer was too stupid to find, so then LEO snagged some other shipments out of the postal service.

     This fucking idiot  placed an order for heroin a week after his 19yr old wife died under mysterious circumstances. He knew LE was posted up and he ordered drugs off the internet anyway! Still, it got through. He signed for it. He opened it. It was a stealth laminated certificate (of course containing his order) congratulating 'him" for completing a seminar. He then freaked out thinking someone was setting him up for forgery cuz he said it looked like a doctorate degree!!! So in his infinite wisdom he decides he's gonna outsmart popo, takes the package outside AND GIVES IT TO THEM saying he didn't know what someone was trying to do to him but he never ordered a fake diploma!

    Top of the second page in that other thread details the package confiscations and Clipped Up's reaction. Seems to me like he did all he could and he got screwed over, plus he claims to have given the idiot buyer a 50% refund.

     Exactly ZERO of my packages have been confiscated by LE. Out of the decency of my heart I warned all four buyers subsequent to finding out Pyrat13 had given a package -the entire package, slip, flat, envelope, cover letter, dope-laden laminated certificate to his local sheriff's department who incidentally had him under surveillance since BEFORE he even ordered. They were like lawn furniture at his house and he thinks it's OK to have felonious amounts of drugs sent to his house WITHOUT INFORMING THE VENDOR. So, #1 NOT confiscated. Given to. I defy anyone to tell me how that is in any way MY fault. Please.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So I finally get the truth out of him 5 days after the fact and about 4 hours after I had just dropped off 4 pkgs with my friend who works at one of the major world-wide shippers. Can't go snag em back cuz the office is of course closed now. Meanwhile, apparently, dickhead's local yokels must have passed pkg1 to the nearest DEA or some such organization because my friend tells me two executive-looking dudes came in super early and took some shit with them. After they left he went to look and sure enough all 4 of mine were gone. I asked if they could have been LE. He said no fucking way-these guys work for my company up at the white collar level But that doesn't mean they won't end up at some LE installation. I ask again what should I have done as a vendor? Stick my head up my ass and hope for the best and think fuck my customers if they get set up?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, I PM all 4 buyer's whose shit was now in the hands of either Corporate big-wigs or what I overwhelmingly thought more likely some DEA bureaucrats who were now deciding who, if anybody, should they go after. BUT, I actually found out that NONE, ZERO of the four packages ever even made it out of the sort facility! So, again #s2,3&amp;4 are just disposed of. I absolutely DID tell those people not to accept a package any time soon.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     @StewertWatts: Even though it miraculously turned out the police never got ahold of your buddy's package don't you think I did the right thing telling him to cover his ass just in case? One buyer got an "apology letter" from the carrier basically saying your package aint coming. I wonder if you know, Stewert, if your friend got one too? Wouldn't you say I did the rightthing warning your friend? I mean it didn't come, right? But you don't seem to be giving me credit for potentially saving him a very uncomfortable evening, no? It would appear you are warning potential buyers that I am trouble. Now that you know the real story can I get you to retract that sentiment as it was ultimately based on erroneous information. I simply thought I should err on the side of keeping my customers out of jail. I think I made the right call but I'll welcome any opinions.

    Wow, what a tool. &gt;:( That's sounds like an awesome way to discreetly package. Now LE has an inside on what to look for. Delete all posts!  :P I rather packaging be something no one talks about  :-X, although you gotta educate eh? Anyways, that sucks. Sorry to hear this  :'( .Hope it all gets sorted.

    i remember reading a thread about some kid that had his wife recently pass away.. and not to mention he was on his computer a week before she passed researched some kind of chemicals to kill someone and make it look like suicide or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    shit was CRAZY.
    <br/>
    then he orders some ron! &gt;_&lt;!
    <br/>
    gives it to the police!?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sounds like he was already in some trouble with the law and told them he could get a package for them.
    <br/>
    boom, delivered, re-delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and that's all on the buyer. the vendor should get a 500% refund and pyrat should take care of his needs for the rest of his natural-born life... and should never have to worry about vending again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    pyrat... WTF...
    <br/>
    you don't deserve the use of this website or HELL.. even these forums.

    @ThumbsUp, StenoJ and shadrock. Thank you for doing the modicum of research which was necessary to ascertain what a fucking tool this Pyrat13 retard is/was. I really don't have the strength to go through it again (for everyone else there is a nearly identical thread started by this same OP whose "friend" still hasn't paid me what was promised even though I was kind enough to release funds early because of some sob story). I went above and beyond. I could have stuck my head in the sand, spent the bitcoins and let everybody get "the knock".  Instead I will be starting over again from less than zero and attempting to build my business back. It's called Karma and some of y'all will be blindsided by it I can see clearly. I still invite all enquiries and if something doesn't make sense as to why I am not a solid individual feel free to ask - hell, accuse if you want to. I've got nothing to hide.
