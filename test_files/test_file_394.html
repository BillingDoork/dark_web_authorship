    Hey There SR,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For my security I plan on shipping my 1st order to an empty house. I Know the owner and maintenance manager, it is an empty rental that won't be lived in for quite some time. I know for a fact the owner ships things there and there has been mail sent to it in the past as I've had to pick it up before.  The maintenance manager told me no one will be living their for at least a year if not 2 or more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I use the owners name? or Just last name? Or is it OK to use a completely different name? OR I could use the businesses name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any suggestions?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks
    <br/>
    <br/>

    try and keep traffic coming through the mailbox if you can, especially if the owner no longer receives any mail there. any postal worker might raise an eyebrow if theres no mail for many weeks or months, and then suddenly a package shows up.  signup for some free coupons, newsletters, and catalogs. maybe sign up for some magazines and voila, complete cover while you shop!
