    So I just moved into a new residence.  I made an order from a domestic vendor on SR that I've ordered from before to this new address.  after awhile waiting for the package to come I asked the vendor where it was and he said the shipment showed up as undeliverable as addressed.  I'm a 100% sure that I put the right address down, since I triple checked it.  After another few days the postman put a Vacant notice in my mailbox, so I called the post office.  They said that they only deliver to registered residents and that all packages were returned to sender, that were shipped in my name.  So anyways I'm just wondering what ever happened to my package.  If the return address wasn't a real address would it have been sent to a mail recovery spot.  If it was, then would they open the package.  It's been a couple months since I've ordered and I've received no love letter.  Am I safe to order again?

    If you've been ordering regularly from SR vendors why is this the first time you've posted?  \

    Something is fishy about all these posts I see about shipping problems coming from people with very little or no forum history.   It's as if none of these people have ever used the postal system before they decided to order drugs in the mail from SR.  I just am not buying it.

    Agreed. This is either fishy or you should probably reconsider using this site until you get your own residences/countries postal system figured out.
