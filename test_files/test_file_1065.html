    I'm not clear on what you are saying, the postman just drops the mail where precisely? on the ground in a heap so the residents have to go through it to find their mail? how many apartments are there in the building? surely there is somewhere for mail to go?

    sorry about that should ve been more precise actually there is a shelf just near to the main door the post man comes in and drops all the mail for that building having 8 apartments in that shelf and then everybody pick up their mail whenever they want...thats the most critical point basically coz you never know wat if somebody sneaks through your mail or watever,,, a bit confused maybe but am sure thats not gonna happen :)

    I got pretty much the same problem and can't figure out what to do. If my package got nicked before I got back from work I'd never know if it was another resident responsible or what had become of it. The only other option I can think of is to have it sent to my work address but I'm really reluctant to do that as if things went wrong then it could cost me my job as well as everything else.

    Not terribly cheap, but it's what I'd use in your situations.

    what are the chances of your neighbors stealing it?
    <br/>
    If it is small amounts..
    <br/>
    I would just treat it like how you get your normal mail
    <br/>
    and be sure to buy from suppliers who have a good
    <br/>
    rep for stealth.
    <br/>
    I have had no problems with UK to UK domestic.

    If your neighbours are thieving junkies or your main door doesn't lock consider something like this if you are not receiving enough packages to warrant a PO box:
    <br/>

    CLEARNET *** http://my.bybox.com/

    I have the same issue but my neighbours are just about OK.
