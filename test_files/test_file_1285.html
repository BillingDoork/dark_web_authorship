    Hey guys, I haven't posted in a while because everything has been smooth and I haven't had any questions or legitimate concerns yet, but I'm thinking of ordering JesusOfRave's 20g MDMA listing instead of just 10g like last time. Let me first say that I've ordered international PERSONAL-sized MDMA/pills a few times, 2 times to be exact, from Schizofreen in the Netherlands. I live on the west coast of the USA, and have had every order come to my place of residence, under my name. I have also received two small-bulk orders in the past, 50 pills from Schizofreen, and about a few weeks ago, 10g from JesusOfRave. Schizofreen has good packaging and amazing presses, which is why I want to order from them again, but I am waiting on their upgrade to Moisture Barrier Bags, just to be EXTRA safe. JoR already uses Moisture Barrier Bags (MBB) in a standard envelope, from England, which is obviously less scrutinized compared to the Netherlands when it comes to entering the US and going through customs. This makes me feel far better as his packaging methods are thorough, being that MBB's are odor-proof when packaged properly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway.. on to my concern. Once again, I've only ordered 50 pills at the most, and 10g of MDMA at the most, from Schizofreen and JoR respectively. JoR's new 20g MDMA listing looks really tempting, but I'm wondering if by some crazy chance that it got discovered by customs (although I highly doubt it), what are the chances that customs/LE would actually do something more than send me a little love letter? 10g I don't have a problem with ordering really. I just sell to personal friends and their good friends, because I like spreading the love of real MDMA instead of cut-shit, and because the extra money is nice for supplying my love for music. I could be wrong, but I'm convinced that 10g really isn't that much when guys are shipping 50g, 100g, 200g+ orders which is TRULY bulk amounts that LE would go after. There is always a risk, but is it that much concern when ordering 20g instead of just 10g?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I appreciate the advice, thanks.

    Depending on the vendors shipping methods, 20g vs 10g would not be much more conspicuous. You've seen how much 10g looks all at once in a bag, it really doesn't take up that much space you know? 20g would not take up that much more space and could be sent just as stealthy as 10g. I don't think that 20g vs 10g would increase the chances of seizure in the way that 10g vs 100g would. Again, it all depends on the vendor's packaging methods, but I think the risk between the two quantities (10 vs 20) would be the same.

    The technical term for that is "drug dealer." Anyways, if you really want to be paranoid just cough up a few extra bucks and buy two 10g packages.

     To answer your question, choose a good vendor and you are fine. LuckyLuciano seems to be one of the better ones and I would order from him if I wanted MDMA most likely. I stay away from the Dutch/German vendors, but they do a good job too usually.

    I was going to say the opposite.  I've seen at least 1 thread where someone got a CD from LuckyLuciano, But I haven't seen that for the german vendor's I've done business with.  All in all, LL's done a TON of orders and has a really good success rate.  Besides, after everything I've heard regarding his MDMA, I REALLY wanna try it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dunno, I didn't think of Canada as a risky country to receive from, but that seems to be the general concensus of the forums and I haven't made a dozen transactions with canadian vendors so I'm by no means an expert.

    That is exactly what I was thinking. When I received 10g, it surprised me how little it was. The envelope easily could've held double the amount and still been just as stealthy. JoR unfortunately just took down his 20g MDMA listing for now, but it looks like I'm leaning that way. 20g of MDMA for $560 is a pretty good deal.

    Hahaha, indeed it does. I'm not denying the fact that if you sell drugs, no matter the reason, you are a "drug dealer." I thought about two 10g packages, and having the 2nd sent to a friends house, but it seems as if 20g in one envelope is fine, especially because JoR uses Moisture Barrier Bags &amp; ships from England.

    I've been a member for 7 months, with about $2200 spent. I'm not a huge spender compared to lots of people here, but I know SR pretty decently now. I already did plenty of research for feedback on his packages. I have also checked out other vendors, and I feel the most secure ordering from him due to the MBB mainly. I don't know if you have ordered from JesusOfRave before, but I highly recommend it. I've done research into LL in the past, but have never ordered from him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the advice guys, I think I will order 20g from JesusOfRave when he eventually puts his 20g MDMA listing back up. I just wanted some outside opinions on the situation.

    and If you can afford the 20g investment then why not? you easily be able to get rid of it all wheather its close friends, personal, or retail 10g will be gone sooner than you want it to be and then you'll wish you had bought 20g.
