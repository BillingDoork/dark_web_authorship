    I have a friend who has 437mL of scentless (to humans anyways) prescription solution that he is sending to me, how should he package it and ship? He is thinking about transferring the fluid to a mouthwash container, taping the lid and marking 'health drink' or something on customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any input?

    It really depends on what this "prescription fluid" is. In my opinion it would be less suspicious to put it in a bottle of cough syrup, reseal it, and label it 'medicine'. It's also probably a bad idea to send the whole 1L at once as Australia is notorious for having strict customs - breaking it up may increase your success.

    I like this idea. Can a vendor with experience or someone with knowledge of customs comment on this as well? Thanks for the suggestion

    Given most drugs can be diluted into liquids then reconstituted via some process or other your success or otherwise will probably entirely depend on whether customs inspect and test it. Have no direct experience of importing/exporting liquids, I am presuming given they are impossible (or at the very least much harder) to conceal it will literally be the luck of the draw as to how nosy Mr customs person is. Packaging it as a health supplement or medicine is unlikely to deter/fool customs, if they have made the decision to open your package they will most likely go that little step further and test, for entry into AU anyway.

    i'm guessing your point is still valid even though it's going from AU to USA?
