    What is the best practice for receiving packages? Is there anything that we can do on our end to make sure that the packages reach us safely, and with no hassles from LE?

    Wait until about 3 seconds until after the mailman has driven away, then run at full speed while jumping for joy to the mailbox.  After you open the mailbox, throw all of the other mail on the ground except your SR package then run back to the house at full speed again.  If you don't see any LE you can run back to the house while jumping for joy, if you see LE then you should just run back to the house as quickly as possible.

    I have something to contribute regarding real name vs. fake name that hasn't been dealt with elsewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you live in a jurisdiction that uses a system of national registration connecting names to addresses, then you are better off using your real name. If you have a nosy postman and have lived in the same house for the last 20 years, use your real name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if you live in a jurisdiction that has no system of national registration connecting names to addresses, and no nosy postman, using a fake name is best practice. Let me give you an example. I live in an apartment building housing thousands of people. To my address alone I get mail for at least 200 different people. There is no way that a fake name could raise a red flag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So it depends on where you are living. But a fake is the way to go if your area doesn't follow the system of national registration.

    Either call the post office and ask, or send yourself 10 letters with all different names and see how many get through.
