    Greetings all! I'm new here and just thought I'd see if anybody would clear up some concerns I had about buying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I plan on shipping to the apartment I live in. The lease is under my girlfriends name and I am not listed anywhere as a resident. It is also a different address than the one on all forms of identification I have. So basically there is nothing connecting me to this apartment. I don't plan on buying any grass, only freebases/powders in personal use quantities. I am located in a small town in the US and plan on ONLY ordering from domestic vendors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *QUESTION*
    <br/>
    So based on this, do you all think it would be relatively safe to ship straight to my apartment? I am completely new to all this and would really appreciate ALL the advice you guys have to offer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A lot of people talk about PO Boxes and virtual offices but advise not to give fake information when opening one so I don't really see how that is better than my current situation where I am somewhat anonymous at a residence where I am 150% sure the person won't snitch (as she is my gf and relies on MY money for HER bills lol). I would prefer a "pigeon hole" method but unfortunately don't have access to anything of that nature here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *I would really appreciate it if somebody with experience could point out the potential flaws in my current method (shipping to apartment where Im not on the lease) as well as point out the benefits I may be overlooking in all other methods.*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been scanning the shipping threads for hours but haven't really seen anything that calms my nerves. But I do apologize if this question has already been anwsered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance

    First of all WELCOME!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The question would simply be a matter of "Do you get mail at that address?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If someone sends you a letter to that address, with the Postal worker leave it for?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If yes, then you are good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dont waste time or $ on a PO box! ;)

    Thank you!Â  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't receive any personal mail at this address. (I still use my parents address for my primary since they only live a couple minutes away.)
    <br/>
    The only thing I have had mailed to this address is some music equipment I ordered, but other than that I have never listed it as my address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But our postal worker would recognize me, assuming the package was being delivered by hand. But letter sized packages all go to our locked mailbox in the apartment complex office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I guess that means I should be ok then?

    Yea man you should be fine, there are several loopholes around it. Remember even if it is a controlled delivery they need to prove that you were aware what the package contained and had Intent. I make it personal habit to just throw the parcel by the door for a few hours incase anything was to go down. I've also heard of people writing on the package "return to sender" and leaving it by the door for the day, which is another very good idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Typically I wouldn't worry this much for smaller orders the most you will receive is a letter of seizure, if your ordering pounds of coke/weed then yes a controlled delivery is more likely.
