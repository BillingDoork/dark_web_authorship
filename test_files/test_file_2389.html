    Had she not signed for it, do you think she still would of gotten pinched?  I think there must be some other evidence that associates her with this package.   Thoughts?  Do you think she'll get convicted of anything?

    I'm curious about this too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be honest I think someone posted a legal precedent here that shows that signing alone doesn't prove ownership. I'm not 100% on that though. She probably had other incriminating things in the house which brought the signing into perspective and made it believable evidence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although if you are asked to sign (providing you have nothing else in your house), take the package and write RETURN TO SENDER across the front, and wait a while. If they bust down your door they're going to be hard pressed to stick shit to you if you've got nothing else and didn't even open the package.

    Signing is only 1 piece of the puzzle for the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In court it is easier to deny ownership of something you refused to sign for but as far as the police investigating you stopping just because you didnt sign for something, that doesnt happen.

    Signing alone does not prove your guilt.  However, it usually allows them to search your property, and if they find any drugs, then you're going to get charged.  Also, if they find any trace of Silk Road--bad news.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if you have it delivered to a "clean" location, are patient about opening it, and generally cautious, then you really have nothing to worry about.  I think there was a case where a controlled delivery caught the guy just after he opened the package that was addressed to him.  He had nothing else on him, was totally clean other than the package contents, and ended up having the charges dropped.

    One other thing to remember, Know your delivery people. USPS,Fedex and UPS drivers all generally use the same route everyday. I'm on a first name basis with my USPS and UPS delivery men, If a newbie shows up with a SR package I would immediately refuse the package.

    Signing for a package in this type of situation doesnt mean that the person is claiming ownership or has knowledge of the contents. But signing for a package that contains contraband does make the states case stronger. Also the police will surely attempt too get a confession and the fact that they have a signature maybe enough too make a person confess.

    This is so true. Shut the fuck up when the cops show up. People don't realize your not required to answer any of their questions,return their phone calls or let them in your home.
