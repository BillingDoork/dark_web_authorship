    While it does seem odd and against standard logic (longest distance takes shortest time and shortest distance takes longest time) it is quite possible because of who's handling your packages.  Entirely different set of eyes and hands moving through customs across the ocean as opposed to in the next state which is just USPS doing their thing.  Now if you were in the middle of Montana or South Dakota or something I'd be scratching my head thinking how the hell did someone get a package from Germany in 1 day there.  But since you're in NY (NYC? I assume you're close to the big apple) it was able to make it in 1 day.  And this is just me but I'd delete that post saying your general whereabouts.

    I've seen many shipments do strange and mysterious things when following the tracking. I don't want to mention exactly how many SR purchases I've made, but it's been dozens, over multiple accounts and to many addresses, all without issue (except for scammers, and to date I've gotten 100% refund each time).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I used to repair and sell legal stuff online, I made hundreds of, maybe a few thousand shipments, all over the world, and never had one get lost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Paranoia doesn't seem to make shipments arrive any faster, either.
