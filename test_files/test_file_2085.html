    Hi I have an order from NE thats gone missing. The vendor has had problems with packaging being idenified so lots have gone missing. They offer on the forum 100% refund for anyone one effected. I contacted them coz its over 2 weeks now but they want customs/seizure letter before they give full refund otherwise its only 50%. I get they are trying to protect themselves from scammers but do you even get a letter in the UK if its been seized?

    you don't always get a love letter from customs in the UK, if it's a negligible amount it's most likely just been destroyed and your won't hear anything from it.

    you also may have been scammed...not to worry you but I heard other people in the UK saying this same thing from something shipped within the EU to UK.Â  I can understand why a vendor would demand a seizure letter but to be honest it's also an easy way to give you a demand you can't meet if the package was never sent...
