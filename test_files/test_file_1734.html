    The USPS has an address validation site that also provides the zip+4 for the address. Use that and you can be pretty confident that address will be deliverable.

    The problem with using the last 4 digits is that sometimes the vendor doesn't know what they are.   When customers give them to you, they are often the wrong 4 digits and using the wrong 4 digits is worse than not using them at all.

    Often, when I receive packages whose address does not include the +4, I find it hand written in blue pen ink on the package. I had assumed that my local post office make use of it?

    If you're a vendor and exporting, it is imperative to do the easy task of looking up the format. If I were to copy and paste 20% of the addresses I get, they would be returned to sender. Buyers should know the address format obviously, but from the amount of people who don't this leaves it to us sellers to do it right. It isn't much work and your reputation and money is on the line.

    Ever since I provided an incorrect +4 zip I just don't add it on now.  The +4 zip will be added automatically by processing and sorting machines and it'll be determined where the package needs to go.  Unless the vendor asks for it I simply don't provide it.

    The +4 at the end of the zip code are not NEEDED, but they are indeed helpful. While I never use them or even know them in the "real world"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can tell you that they are used to identify the "CR" (Carrier Route) an area that is even MORE specific then the zip code.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Protip: The CR (Carrier Route) is the actual "route" that a mail person is on that day. In other words it is the "area" that is serviced by one particular postal worker.
