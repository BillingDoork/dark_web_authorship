    So I've ordered a small amount of a research chemical, after the package didn't show up forever, I contacted him as the package has DCN tracking, and he told me his tracking said it was delivered 4 days ago. Including today, I haven't received anything. No one has gotten the mail besides me, I carefully look through for anything with my name on it, and nothing, My neighbors are old and would probably return something if they noticed an incorrect address but that's never happened before anyways. I know sometimes it'll be marked as delivered, but would usually be at the PO and arrive the following day. What the fuck are they doing with my shit? Vendor is also trusted and has not one negative feedback, and has been used in the past so I can definitely say it's not their fault.

    if its a research chemical whats stopping you from ringing the courier service to see where it is with the DCN? I have called in the past from payphones for illegal o/s packages that were seized nothing happened. just told me it was being held at least i knew it was gone

    Maybe double check that the vendor is looking at the right tracking #. Happens to the best of us. Past that, I'm really not sure. You have contacted USPS, right? I once had a package say delivered as well, probably a year ago. It turns out my mailman had it in some crevice of his truck and skipped right over it when I ended up calling the PO so who knows, this could be your situation as well.

    This happened to me a while back with a few pills I had ordered to the house. Package was shown to be delivered but I didn't receive any mail. My guess is that it was delivered to the wrong house by mistake and I never got the package returned to me (and of course I couldn't report it). Vendor was sympathetic but declined to reship or refund, which I totally understand, but it sucks nonetheless that I lost a few bucks. That's now why I ship to a separate address where it isn't possible to end up somewhere else.

    If you call up USPS and ask about the DCN on a package that they have intercepted, they're going to have a recording of that phone call, and that recording will show up as court and be considered proof that you intended to possess the package. There's no plausible deniability if you inquire about a missing package like that. You know that the postal inspectors and your local town/city police, and maybe even some state police, have all been informed about your missing packages right? You're now in the system as a known drug seeker and potential distributor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Research chemicals are not outright "legal". If a Postal Inspector were to visit/call the buyer, I assure you the buyer could not form a satisfactory legitimate reason for having wanted to order said chemical; unless he happens to be enrolled in a Chemistry degree program at a school, or is a professional chemist...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if they can't prosecute you for the chemical, they can use your intent as a non-professional to purchase a chemical which is known to be psychoactive in humans as evidence that you likely store more chemicals/drugs that may be illegal and get a warrant to SWAT raid your ass.

    Just saying from personal experience, called told me it was held that was it, no raids or police asking to to be questioned (and it was for a very large order).  Better yet get a trusted friend to call at least then IF the call is recorded its not your voice that MAY be being recorded.  and as extra precaution like everyone else i also made sure there was nothing in the house at the time to cover my ass.
    <br/>
    as for research chemicals go yes you are right about what their profession might be however its not exactly illegal to order and plausible dependability does work for these type of shipments speaking from personal experience as well.

    The PO won't be able to help you anyway.  They'll have the info you have..delivered.  This happens frequently.  It was delivered..just not to you.  It could be either the shipper got the address wrong..or you could have mistakenly given the shipper an incorrect address..or the carrier simply delivered to the wrong address.   The carrier could have also stolen it but t4hat's unlikely. Bottom line is there are several reasons why it happened and chances are it's gone.  Best chance to recover it is (if it is correctly addressed) is the person it was delivered to in in error puts the pkg back into the system.

    Have to agree with him, could be anything. But for the record I once had a miss scan where the tracking showed delivered but the package did not turn up until 6 business days later. It happens, but rarely, so dont bank on it.

    I tell you, SR is amazing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You don't have to go through any obstacle alone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tracking said a package was delivered to a facility and delivered to a p o box, yet, p o box is empty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I am not worried for a minute, but I did want to share that whenever something happens in real life, someone on SR somewhere, is going through the exact same thing.

    Good thread, OP.
