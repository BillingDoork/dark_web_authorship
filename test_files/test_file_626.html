    Okay, Ive been doing my research for quite a while, &amp; I'm very new to using the mail in distributing buds. Ill be working up to lbs, but for now I have a simple oz with a general idea on shipping it. Domestic - to AK. (Using latex gloves for all packaging, and removing/cleaning ganja residue thoroughly of course.) Could I simply use a USPS flat rate EXPRESS envelope, seal my oz around a normal zip-lock/saran for shape, than food save (vacuum seal) twice, then I just toss it in there and mail it (assuming I took precautions on all things that can set off a postal inspector to have reasonable suspicions, such as labeling, postage, too much tape, etc. ) My only worry is what shape should I make it take? Could I fit it flat with some folded papers for even weight distribution or should I even worry about making it look like documents? I'm just puzzled on how much envelopes are scrutinized on there physical shape when mailed.

    Thank you! feedback is much appreciated! 8)

    What I recommend is that you disguise your ganja as a legitimate product, such as go to a foodstore and buy some cheap item that comes in a box, empty the box, insert ganja, and reseal unnoticeable with glue or super glue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is the best method as even if it was accidentally opened the inspector/parent/package opener would think it was a legitimate package, also if they x-ray they will see the box and let it go thru their international customs.

    Thanks! haha  ;D but ive heard if its domestic USPS they won't send anything through an x-ray unless it was extremely suspicious I assume. I shipped my first oz yesterday in a little flat rate box, I used rubbing alcohol to make sure there was no pot residue on the vacuum sealed oz. Nor in the box or on my fingers.
