    UK customs have intercepted a packet to my address and police came round to see me, asking if i knew anything about it, saying to let them know if someone else sent it or if i ordered it, said if it escalates they may take my computer and look at my bank records. What do? They said it is around 40g of weed in the bag.

    I suppose that since you are here posting, there might be some truth in what they are saying? Are you expecting a 40g order of weed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How exposed are you in terms of risk? Are you using full disc crypto and PGP as standard? What would your bank records or computer show if a team were to come knocking? How well would you do if someone security audited your behavior?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hard to advise you one way or another without knowing more details.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (NB: No details that could be used to identify you please :-) )

    i dont use disc crypto but im thinking just pull the offending hard drives out, just to be on the safe side. i use PGP, tor, and if they were to audit my bank they would find a few transactions to a btc trading site 2 months ago. my "behaviour" is staying at home all day every day.

    edit: i'm not involved in any criminal activity in my actual activities (i dont sell)

    I dont know about this.. Why would they pay you a friendly visit to ask you if you ordered 40gs of weed? I've known low scale weed dealers who have got nicked before. It usually involves staking you out and running intelligence till they turn up and nick you and ask you to flip on someone.

    Standard SR procedure.  Clean house, DBAN, do not deny or confirm.  You don't know anything about anything and you want a lawyer.

    Never heard of something like this happening in the UK over 40g of weed.  A few years ago I received a customs letter for a 56g order of weed that was intercepted, boy was I pissed but there was no police visit.  In my case it wasn't an order off SR though, not that it makes any difference.  Are you in Ireland?

    Just tell them a pal sent it to you to save on petrol. If they ask about the btc transactions just say you were intrigued and done a decent job of racking up a little profit in the making.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NB: Buy some coins via cash in mail and withdraw to your bank account. That way it looks as though you bought coins at a decent price and sold them even better.

    NEVER EVER TALK TO THE POLICE!! SAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING (NEITHER CONFIRM OR DENY) AND ASK FOR A LAWYER IF IT COMES TO IT, CLEAN YOU HOUSE OF ALL INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE AND DBAN YOUR HARD DRIVES OR DITCH ALL TOGETHER.

     For 40g of weed? Yeah sure. They can come back with a warrant for the comp, but it would be fcuking stupid as they have just given you the heads up to wipe it clear of any evidence.
     <br/>
     And bank records, theres feck all chance of that.

     <br/>
     What do? They said it is around 40g of weed in the bag.
