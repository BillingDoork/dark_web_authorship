    I was reading about USPS cause I had heard rumors that this was going to happen. I don't think its official yet but the wonderful already slow as hell postal service is already talking about adding yet another day to all first class and priority mail delivery's to save money for their budget.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can't find it but this is what it said. Express mail not affected and first class I thought it said would  be affected. Priority mail 2-3 day shipping cost the postal service a lot of extra money the reason being is the postal service has to in a lot of cause utilize commercial airlines and other air options to get the priority mail to its destination on time. With rising fuel costs this has gotten even more expensive and is would only be used for express delivery a far more expensive rate paid to cover this cost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The postal service could save Billions of dollars by adding an extra day to these delivery's therefor eliminating the cost and traffic of use of the far more expensive air options which would allow USPS the time needed to use the ground transportation option instead a far cheaper option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Priority mail was definitely the target of it I believe it would slow down first class mail too simply due to increased mail traffic by ground going out the trucks.

    I never heard such a thing.  I did hear that they are going to stop Saturday mail pick up and letter deliveries.  They will still be doing package deliveries on Saturday though.  Now sure if they are still going to go through with it.

    Add a day?  There is no limit.  They can take 20 days for first class and priority if they feel like it.  So you're saying that they will just re-estimate their delivery time lol.  That's all it is, an estimate. ::)
