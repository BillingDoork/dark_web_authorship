    Good afternoon!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you are doing well when you receive this, whatever the timezone may be, which could mean good morning, good evening as well as good night!
    <br/>

    I love the services this site facilitates and the whole concept is something that I appreciate. This forum is great and so far, I am leaning towards this as a center of learning and heightened gravitas, especially with the level of knowledge and expertise on these forums pages. That being said as a new member, and ( soon to be vend!) I'm quietly startpaging and looking through the security/shipping forum to learn the in's and out's of secure, stealth shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I haven't come across this yet but I am wondering whether there is a single concise package/information source I could access for the most secure stealth method of shipping prescription medication domestically (NA/CAN) and internationally to the U.S. Customs seems to be an outright annoyance, but not something that can't be overcome and If I am to increase bottom line, to secure profit margins it seems to me I must reach the highest gross market demand for my product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have advise on packaging materials, specifically of export to prescription meds (to bypass dogs/customs) to raise the least suspicion? For example something I came across was the difference in vacuum sealed &lt; MBB in regards to cannabis, does the same principle apply to prescription meds as well? Also, if there is a specific type of envelope effective for small counts I would appreciate a nod in the right direction, I'm no macgyver when it comes to that sort of thing.
    <br/>

    Thanks for reading, hope to hear any advance on this.
