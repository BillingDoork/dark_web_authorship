    hello. ive been a bud vendor for a little bit here and im thinking of bringing back my 1/4 oz regular brick mexican weed listings. the thing is before i moved so many packages through my P.O. it was overwhelming having to ship all of them with DCN. I would like to try shipping them at the drop box first class without DCN s. how do i calculate postage.like how many stamps or whatever and should i make this a finalize early only listing because i have no way to track it but i dont want people to think im trying to scam them. sorry for all the questions and thanks in advance for any replies.

    Sounds like you have a scale already, why not use that?  :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Staples sells shipping scales.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, just do the DCN. It's only 70 cents extra or something and gives you much more peace of mind.

    i know dcn is the way to go because thats the only way ive shipped anything so far and im continuing to use them on my larger packages. im just trying to get away from taking 20 little packages into my post office every day to get the DCN scanned. just trying to stay under the radar. its not bad with 2 -3 big packages ever other day but i started getting uncomfortable before lol. maybe paranoia but they say only the paranoid survive lol

    You don't need to bring DCN packages into the PO. You can just drop them in the blue boxes.

    Yep no need to set foot in a post office to mail your packages with DCN. I've used both priority and first class with DCN in the blue boxes without any problems.

    This is true, but the PO workers will NEVER tell you this. They will actually tell you the opposite. Just make sure you got your $ covered in postage.

    Guess the postal workers around here are nicer. I asked about it in the very begging and he told me it wasn't a problem and happily gave me a large stack of DCNs :)

    The DCNs are there for the taking at any PO I visit. But if you tell the PO worker that you want to add your own DCN and stamps and drop it in a blue box, they will lead you to believe that you can't do this. This is the info that is false.

    I never had a problem with that. I went to a PO pretty far away from where I live, picked up $200 worth of stamps, they told me how to do it, and gave me a stack of DCN's about 6 inches thick  ;D

    If you are not using one of their mailers that say priority then you can grab priority stickers from them. If it does not say priority then I believe it will automatically go first class.
