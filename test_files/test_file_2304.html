    Hi guys
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I'm about to trek down the silk road for the first time, and just wanting to take the most precautions possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have read a few different posts about the process of shipment, between the ideas of having it mailed to a nearby vacant house, whether to address it to your name or not etc, and am considering an alternative idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A previous housemate/tenant that used to live at my house has now moved overseas. So I was thinking that I could address the shipment to my address but in the name of said previous housemate/tenant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would this be a good idea? or are there other risks that I am not taking into consideration here? Like, if it got intercepted, would customs or whatever contact this previous tenant about it? the main reason I am concerned is because I no longer have contact with this previous tenant, and thus they won't be aware that someone i.e. me is using their name to have goods sent. But even then, she was a pretty cool chick, and I don't think she would really care. just wanted to check if this scenario is logical.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    I've had 2 packages from SR delivered to my address using the name of a former tenant and no problems so far, even though he hasn't lived here in about 4 years (I still get mail addressed to him on a weekly basis, and not just junk mail - bills from credit card companies, documents from his university, that sort of thing)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I don't plan on placing multiple orders monthly using this name... trying to limit the amount of mail received to a similar level to what I've been receiving to date.Â  Also, my postman and I are pretty cool with one another though (same postman for the last 4 years I've lived here) and he knows I forward the mail from this prior tenant onwards so that might be a different situation than what you have.
