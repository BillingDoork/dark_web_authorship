    right got a holiday coming up soon, wanting to take some goodies off the road with me, dont say get them when your over there i want to take quality products with me, where im going is irrelevant i will be going on a plane with luggage and hand luggage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my usual way to take stuff abroad....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    empty deodrant can
    <br/>
    hammer top part in so you can access the can
    <br/>
    pack goodies in the can and stuff can pop the plastic cap back on
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as far as im led to believe scanners cant see through metal this will be going in my suit case not my hand luggage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    can anyone suggest any better way to take stuff abroad? packaging is key here needs to look unsuspicious... can you suggest any way to get approx 20 pills and 10g of C abroad without any fuck ups or alarms raised in the worst case scenario that it gets scanned or it is gone through, just looking for packaging tips ect not to be told dogs will sniff it out ect.

    Small amounts of green can be rolled in the cig roller that makes it look just like a cig. Then take a pack, remove the cig's, drop a couple in, then fill it back up with smokes. Place in pocket and go. You can have the smokes, just no lighter or matches.

    question.. are you flying medical state to medical state?
    <br/>
    so.. where you're going is NOT irrelevant..
    <br/>
    i've thrown a few grams of oil inside of a make up container....
    <br/>
    and just threw it on my check in... so nothing was in my carry on.
    <br/>
    TSA will see that the aerosol can looks "suspicious".. and they will DAMN SURE..
    <br/>
    "access" it.. is this even serious? lol..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and as far as joints in a cigarette pack.. they'd smell it..
    <br/>
    unless you have a plastic wrap machine..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    seriously.. depends on what you're taking and where you're taking it..
    <br/>
    until then there are no serious answers and this is not a serious question. =/

    I once went trough airport security (intra EU flight) with some weed in my boxers, the metal detector went off and i got frisked, luckily enough they didn't inspect my balls too close, didn't get caught It was quite stupid on my side tho!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also once smuggled 1 tab of LSD + a bit of molly hidden in pack of chewing gum. I suppose you must be rather unlucky to get caught with small amounts in an EU to EU flight, there is also no nude-scanners etc.
    <br/>
    I would never do that again tho, too much risk, just me being young and stupid(and reckless)

    I don't know why people carry stuff on them.  I usually put stuff in my clothes in my checked bags.  I've left stuff in pockets inside cigarette cases, cigar cases, whatever cases I can find. I just leave them inside my jean pockets or any other thick jacket pockets all folded up with the rest of my clothes.  I've even gotten one of those lil stickers and slips that says your bag was opened blah blah and my shit was still in there, didn't even vac seal it, should of though.   However this was more than 5 years ago today I would probably just get something shipped to where I'm going or even ship it to myself.

     The contact case worked fine with 2c-i. Its also helpful in measuring dosages if you just remember how much you put in each case.

    It might be different in America but in Australia I have flown domestically with 500-1000 pills multiple times through a couple of different major airports.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This was a few years ago before I knew about Silk Road and good packaging techniques all I did was double bag the pills in clip-seal bags, wrap some duck tape the whole way around the bags to make it into a nice log shape and then taped it to the front of my crotch. I passed through security easily every time, the bulge wasn't noticeable through jeans.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've done an loaded international journey once with drugs in my stomach, but it's something I would never do again. I'm not the kind of person to experience anxiety but going through a 16 hour flight and customs with a load of stimulants inside me gave me a feeling of panic I had never felt before. Your stomach is the only safe place to put the gear as the only way you'll get caught is if you are profiled or one of the pellets bursts. Don't trust your deodorant can against people who's jobs it is to find hidden stashes in airports. Depending on where you are going, customs could be very strict and your holiday could end in a long jail sentence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you really must do it you'll need the following:
    <br/>
    *latex gloves
    <br/>
    *cling-wrap
    <br/>
    *dental floss
    <br/>
    *edible lubricant (get a brand that doesn't degrade condoms)
    <br/>
    *Strong anti-acid
    <br/>
    *Loperamide
    <br/>
    *Laxatives
    <br/>
    *Pasta strainer
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cut the finger off a latex glove and put create a pellet you feel you could swallow by placing the drugs inside. Use dental floss to tie the end several times as this will not disintegrate in your stomach. Wrap cling-wrap around the pellet. Then put the pellet in another fingertip and tie with dental floss again. Do this until you have 4 layers of latex and 4 layers of the cling-wrap to protect against a layer bursting, because you can never be too safe. It's better to make several small pellets than one big pellet that is hard to swallow and shit out. I do not recommend ever putting more than 500grams in your stomach (even that is very uncomfortable) although there are many people who do 1KG+.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once you have your pellets ready take a laxative and ensure your stomach is completely empty of food. Then take a couple of anti-acid tablets (to help neutralize stomach acid) followed by a hefty dose of Loperamide (this will stop you shitting for the long flight). Once you have done this, soak the pellets in lubricant and swallow them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the flight it's suspicious if you don't eat or drink, but you will want to avoid doing this as much as possible as you will feel extremely sick if you combine a meal with Loperamide and a stomach full of pellets. I ordered food, put it in a toiletries bag and disposed of it down the toilet to avoid looking like a swallower.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you get out of the airport go straight to the hotel and take a large dose of laxatives, hold a pasta strainer under your ass and cry in relief that it's over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.

    A few pills? Put em in a legitimate RX pill bottle with assorted other pills. I've traveled dozens of times with the pill bottle in my pocket. I don't even take it out of my pocket when I'm going thru the metal detector, it stays with me the whole way. You could put the C in empty gelcaps if you wanted.

    Taken things through airports many times. All were for personal use amounts on domestic flights, but it sounds like this is a vacation and may be similar. A few things to consider.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) I think that taking whatever it is you have with you and not in your checked luggage is a better bet. I don't like the idea of not being able to see what's being done to my bag as it is put beneath the plane. It's also nice to have the peace of mind once you get through security that everything will be OK. You can look into what security methods are used at your departing airport.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) Don't look like a sketch ball going through airport security. Their constantly profiling everyone that walks through, whether they admit it or not. If you look nervous, they are nervous too. Move quick and don't draw attention. Bags should look like they normally would if you were traveling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have always put my pills in a prescription bottle with my name on it. Airport security isn't going to open up your medication to make sure you only have what you are prescribed. You could alternatively put them in a jar of Tylenol or something. If you want save the tamper seal and glue it back on, making it appear unopened. Powders can be put in vitamin capsules following a similar protocol to the pills. They are not going to sit there opening up your capsules if you appear to be a normal traveler on route to wherever it is your going. I have the biggest anxiety about bringing herb, but as a mmj patient have gotten used to having the best. I usually triple vac a small baggie of what I'll need for the trip and wear it on my waistline with compression athletic shorts. If your airport has the newer sniffer machines or the x-ray machines, this won't work. In this case I would seal appropriately and put it in the pocket of a pair of pants in my bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PM me if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help however I can.

    In modern airports they usually have all tools to detect even microscopic amounts of drugs, they can take sample from surface of your fingers, bags, hairs.
    <br/>
    So if I wanna enjoy my stuff on some sandy beach, I keep in mind the next:
    <br/>
    1. Measure very little amount of stuff, so that you can pay penalty fine, not to go in jail. (e.g. in my case it's 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT)
    <br/>
    2. Prefer "effective" drugs with little effective dose (e.g. hiding 1 mg of LSD crystal, is easier than hiding 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT, hiding 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT is easier than 1 gram of MDMA)
    <br/>
    3. Wrap and seal stuff several times. Spread powder evenly in sealed baggie. Wash sealed baggie with pure Alcohol in gloves before several days of flying.
    <br/>
    4. Places of hiding, I prefer to hide in checked baggage, because it's a very big bag with wheels, it has advantages of hiding.
    <br/>
    Among places of hiding, I prefer wheels and handles. Clean handle or wheels with pure Alcohol with gloves on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4.1. It's a bit of tedious work to hide in wheels, but it gives plausible deniability, by saying that some stuff can be caught by your wheels.
    <br/>
    4.2. Among handles I prefer the top one. Why us that ?
    <br/>
    If you saw X-ray in Airports, you must think a little in what dimensions it works.
    <br/>
    First, X-rays go horizontally, not vertically. Second, X-rays holes in airports have such size, that big bag can be put there only in two positions, either horizontally as usually it's placed, or on one of the sides, but not vertically.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thus if you placed your thing baggie with stuff inside top handle, there's almost no chance to see that thin baggie inside handle with X-Ray

    Crotch it! Wear multiple pairs of underpants and keep the drugs (well sealed of course) right under your taint. Wear jeans to keep it secure. Also dont go through the x ray scanner opt for the pat down instead. This is well within your rights and there should be signs around the security explaining this. I've done this several times no problem with up to 3/4 ounce of pot. Trust me this is safer than anywhere in your luggage.

    Empty vitamin pill capsules and check your luggage. I don't see why you would want to carry it on you, the odds of getting searched with your personal luggage are 100x more likely than with checked luggage. You can check just about anything short of explosives, so that's all they're really looking for with those baggage screeners. If you're carrying luggage on you, they inspect everything on the screener, and if you happen to get a hard ass, just about everything is looked at, and a lot is even taken out and searched.

     Crotch it! Wear multiple pairs of underpants and keep the drugs (well sealed of course) right under your taint. Wear jeans to keep it secure. Also dont go through the x ray scanner opt for the pat down instead. This is well within your rights and there should be signs around the security explaining this. I've done this several times no problem with up to 3/4 ounce of pot. Trust me this is safer than anywhere in your luggage.

     In modern airports they usually have all tools to detect even microscopic amounts of drugs, they can take sample from surface of your fingers, bags, hairs.
     <br/>
     So if I wanna enjoy my stuff on some sandy beach, I keep in mind the next:
     <br/>
     1. Measure very little amount of stuff, so that you can pay penalty fine, not to go in jail. (e.g. in my case it's 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT)
     <br/>
     2. Prefer "effective" drugs with little effective dose (e.g. hiding 1 mg of LSD crystal, is easier than hiding 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT, hiding 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT is easier than 1 gram of MDMA)
     <br/>
     3. Wrap and seal stuff several times. Spread powder evenly in sealed baggie. Wash sealed baggie with pure Alcohol in gloves before several days of flying.
     <br/>
     4. Places of hiding, I prefer to hide in checked baggage, because it's a very big bag with wheels, it has advantages of hiding.
     <br/>
     Among places of hiding, I prefer wheels and handles. Clean handle or wheels with pure Alcohol with gloves on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     4.1. It's a bit of tedious work to hide in wheels, but it gives plausible deniability, by saying that some stuff can be caught by your wheels.
     <br/>
     4.2. Among handles I prefer the top one. Why us that ?
     <br/>
     If you saw X-ray in Airports, you must think a little in what dimensions it works.
     <br/>
     First, X-rays go horizontally, not vertically. Second, X-rays holes in airports have such size, that big bag can be put there only in two positions, either horizontally as usually it's placed, or on one of the sides, but not vertically.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thus if you placed your thing baggie with stuff inside top handle, there's almost no chance to see that thin baggie inside handle with X-Ray

     Taken things through airports many times. All were for personal use amounts on domestic flights, but it sounds like this is a vacation and may be similar. A few things to consider.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) I think that taking whatever it is you have with you and not in your checked luggage is a better bet. I don't like the idea of not being able to see what's being done to my bag as it is put beneath the plane. It's also nice to have the peace of mind once you get through security that everything will be OK. You can look into what security methods are used at your departing airport.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2) Don't look like a sketch ball going through airport security. Their constantly profiling everyone that walks through, whether they admit it or not. If you look nervous, they are nervous too. Move quick and don't draw attention. Bags should look like they normally would if you were traveling.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I have always put my pills in a prescription bottle with my name on it. Airport security isn't going to open up your medication to make sure you only have what you are prescribed. You could alternatively put them in a jar of Tylenol or something. If you want save the tamper seal and glue it back on, making it appear unopened. Powders can be put in vitamin capsules following a similar protocol to the pills. They are not going to sit there opening up your capsules if you appear to be a normal traveler on route to wherever it is your going. I have the biggest anxiety about bringing herb, but as a mmj patient have gotten used to having the best. I usually triple vac a small baggie of what I'll need for the trip and wear it on my waistline with compression athletic shorts. If your airport has the newer sniffer machines or the x-ray machines, this won't work. In this case I would seal appropriately and put it in the pocket of a pair of pants in my bag.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     PM me if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help however I can.

     It might be different in America but in Australia I have flown domestically with 500-1000 pills multiple times through a couple of different major airports.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This was a few years ago before I knew about Silk Road and good packaging techniques all I did was double bag the pills in clip-seal bags, wrap some duck tape the whole way around the bags to make it into a nice log shape and then taped it to the front of my crotch. I passed through security easily every time, the bulge wasn't noticeable through jeans.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I've done an loaded international journey once with drugs in my stomach, but it's something I would never do again. I'm not the kind of person to experience anxiety but going through a 16 hour flight and customs with a load of stimulants inside me gave me a feeling of panic I had never felt before. Your stomach is the only safe place to put the gear as the only way you'll get caught is if you are profiled or one of the pellets bursts. Don't trust your deodorant can against people who's jobs it is to find hidden stashes in airports. Depending on where you are going, customs could be very strict and your holiday could end in a long jail sentence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you really must do it you'll need the following:
     <br/>
     *latex gloves
     <br/>
     *cling-wrap
     <br/>
     *dental floss
     <br/>
     *edible lubricant (get a brand that doesn't degrade condoms)
     <br/>
     *Strong anti-acid
     <br/>
     *Loperamide
     <br/>
     *Laxatives
     <br/>
     *Pasta strainer
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Cut the finger off a latex glove and put create a pellet you feel you could swallow by placing the drugs inside. Use dental floss to tie the end several times as this will not disintegrate in your stomach. Wrap cling-wrap around the pellet. Then put the pellet in another fingertip and tie with dental floss again. Do this until you have 4 layers of latex and 4 layers of the cling-wrap to protect against a layer bursting, because you can never be too safe. It's better to make several small pellets than one big pellet that is hard to swallow and shit out. I do not recommend ever putting more than 500grams in your stomach (even that is very uncomfortable) although there are many people who do 1KG+.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Once you have your pellets ready take a laxative and ensure your stomach is completely empty of food. Then take a couple of anti-acid tablets (to help neutralize stomach acid) followed by a hefty dose of Loperamide (this will stop you shitting for the long flight). Once you have done this, soak the pellets in lubricant and swallow them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the flight it's suspicious if you don't eat or drink, but you will want to avoid doing this as much as possible as you will feel extremely sick if you combine a meal with Loperamide and a stomach full of pellets. I ordered food, put it in a toiletries bag and disposed of it down the toilet to avoid looking like a swallower.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When you get out of the airport go straight to the hotel and take a large dose of laxatives, hold a pasta strainer under your ass and cry in relief that it's over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Good luck.

      The contact case worked fine with 2c-i. Its also helpful in measuring dosages if you just remember how much you put in each case. I also had some NBOMe in aluminum foil that I just put in a pack of gum. Then I had an alprazolam and proylene glycol solution (250 mg, 125 mL respectively) that I just put in a small sport bottle. On the way back, I wadded some MDMA in a gum wrapper and put it with the rest of the NBOMe. I checked the 2c-i and alprazolam but had the NBOMe and MDMA in my carry on. TSA even pulled me aside for further searching (checked my bag a little and scanned my phone with some sort of wand using microwaves the agent said) and I was still good to go. Lol

I just leave them inside my jean pockets or any other thick jacket pockets all folded up with the rest of my clothes.  I've even gotten one of those lil stickers and slips that says your bag was opened blah blah and my shit was still in there, didn't even vac seal it, should of though.   However this was more than 5 years ago today I would probably just get something shipped to where I'm going or even ship it to myself.

    im not taking aerosols on the flight i was talking about putting it in my checked in luggage (suit case)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    can any of you clarify if scanners can see through metal? i used the deodrant can method for some pills at new year and it worked also brought back 30g of weed in the same can no probelms, but that doesnt mean it was scanned and got through for all i know it might not have been scanned at all either way
    <br/>
    <br/>
    uk to holland is the flight also the same flight as when i last taken stuff and brought it back. also i know this airport has body scanners when exiting the country, for all i know they could have them on the way in now as well so i dont like the idea of having it on me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the doedrant can i will use this time will be a new can emptied then same method used, it will be a lynx can, if you guys know what a lynx can looks like you will know that it has a large plastic cover over the top of it and if you pop that off you will see the plastic covers a great deal of the can, i place the can in a toiletries bag in amongst the toiletries bag is a small shaver a bottle or two of aftershave toothpaste ect all the usual shit so that going through a scanner all in a small area is gonna be hard to see whats in it right? well thats my theory
    <br/>
    <br/>
    all advice so far is appreciated guys any more methods that you see more fool proof than mine please let me know, especially SR vendors. i've also thought about using the dvd case with the metal foil as a cover on the case but thats so easy to just open and see where as a deodorant can concealed in a toiletries bag much less sus :)

    are you sure? i dont think they can, used to get bars of mephedrone and it was posted in layers of kumagra (oral jelly viagra) then ink proof paper, then pressed in a thick piece of card and the bar was in amongst that. great stealth when opened it looked like layers og kumagra and not what you knew it was.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and if they can then why do most vendors use mbb bags then vaccum sealing for packages, or like stated before dvd cases with foil backed paper as the dvd cover. also had small metal tins with stuff in them as well? just curious as most good successful vendors tend to use mteal based packing.

     are you sure? i dont think they can, used to get bars of mephedrone and it was posted in layers of kumagra (oral jelly viagra) then ink proof paper, then pressed in a thick piece of card and the bar was in amongst that. great stealth when opened it looked like layers og kumagra and not what you knew it was.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     and if they can then why do most vendors use mbb bags then vaccum sealing for packages, or like stated before dvd cases with foil backed paper as the dvd cover. also had small metal tins with stuff in them as well? just curious as most good successful vendors tend to use mteal based packing.

    Yes I am sure.  You should look into electromagnetic radiation.  How do you think they examine vehicles and tractor trailers with x-ray?  Granted I don't know how powerful a baggage or postage x-ray is...  I do know that I have had much success fooling postage x-ray devices over the years with mylar and carbon paper. each on their own respectively.  I would imagine that luggage x-ray devices would be more powerful than postage one but I really don't know.  I do know that I have had airport x-rays ruin camera film before lol.

      Empty vitamin pill capsules and check your luggage. I don't see why you would want to carry it on you, the odds of getting searched with your personal luggage are 100x more likely than with checked luggage. You can check just about anything short of explosives, so that's all they're really looking for with those baggage screeners. If you're carrying luggage on you, they inspect everything on the screener, and if you happen to get a hard ass, just about everything is looked at, and a lot is even taken out and searched.

      Crotch it! Wear multiple pairs of underpants and keep the drugs (well sealed of course) right under your taint. Wear jeans to keep it secure. Also dont go through the x ray scanner opt for the pat down instead. This is well within your rights and there should be signs around the security explaining this. I've done this several times no problem with up to 3/4 ounce of pot. Trust me this is safer than anywhere in your luggage.

      In modern airports they usually have all tools to detect even microscopic amounts of drugs, they can take sample from surface of your fingers, bags, hairs.
      <br/>
      So if I wanna enjoy my stuff on some sandy beach, I keep in mind the next:
      <br/>
      1. Measure very little amount of stuff, so that you can pay penalty fine, not to go in jail. (e.g. in my case it's 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT)
      <br/>
      2. Prefer "effective" drugs with little effective dose (e.g. hiding 1 mg of LSD crystal, is easier than hiding 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT, hiding 150 mg of 4-AcO-DMT is easier than 1 gram of MDMA)
      <br/>
      3. Wrap and seal stuff several times. Spread powder evenly in sealed baggie. Wash sealed baggie with pure Alcohol in gloves before several days of flying.
      <br/>
      4. Places of hiding, I prefer to hide in checked baggage, because it's a very big bag with wheels, it has advantages of hiding.
      <br/>
      Among places of hiding, I prefer wheels and handles. Clean handle or wheels with pure Alcohol with gloves on.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      4.1. It's a bit of tedious work to hide in wheels, but it gives plausible deniability, by saying that some stuff can be caught by your wheels.
      <br/>
      4.2. Among handles I prefer the top one. Why us that ?
      <br/>
      If you saw X-ray in Airports, you must think a little in what dimensions it works.
      <br/>
      First, X-rays go horizontally, not vertically. Second, X-rays holes in airports have such size, that big bag can be put there only in two positions, either horizontally as usually it's placed, or on one of the sides, but not vertically.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Thus if you placed your thing baggie with stuff inside top handle, there's almost no chance to see that thin baggie inside handle with X-Ray
      <br/>

      <br/>
      1) I think that taking whatever it is you have with you and not in your checked luggage is a better bet. I don't like the idea of not being able to see what's being done to my bag as it is put beneath the plane. It's also nice to have the peace of mind once you get through security that everything will be OK. You can look into what security methods are used at your departing airport.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      2) Don't look like a sketch ball going through airport security. Their constantly profiling everyone that walks through, whether they admit it or not. If you look nervous, they are nervous too. Move quick and don't draw attention. Bags should look like they normally would if you were traveling.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I have always put my pills in a prescription bottle with my name on it. Airport security isn't going to open up your medication to make sure you only have what you are prescribed. You could alternatively put them in a jar of Tylenol or something. If you want save the tamper seal and glue it back on, making it appear unopened. Powders can be put in vitamin capsules following a similar protocol to the pills. They are not going to sit there opening up your capsules if you appear to be a normal traveler on route to wherever it is your going. I have the biggest anxiety about bringing herb, but as a mmj patient have gotten used to having the best. I usually triple vac a small baggie of what I'll need for the trip and wear it on my waistline with compression athletic shorts. If your airport has the newer sniffer machines or the x-ray machines, this won't work. In this case I would seal appropriately and put it in the pocket of a pair of pants in my bag.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      PM me if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help however I can.

      A few pills? Put em in a legitimate RX pill bottle with assorted other pills. I've traveled dozens of times with the pill bottle in my pocket. I don't even take it out of my pocket when I'm going thru the metal detector, it stays with me the whole way. You could put the C in empty gelcaps if you wanted.

      It might be different in America but in Australia I have flown domestically with 500-1000 pills multiple times through a couple of different major airports.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This was a few years ago before I knew about Silk Road and good packaging techniques all I did was double bag the pills in clip-seal bags, wrap some duck tape the whole way around the bags to make it into a nice log shape and then taped it to the front of my crotch. I passed through security easily every time, the bulge wasn't noticeable through jeans.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I've done an loaded international journey once with drugs in my stomach, but it's something I would never do again. I'm not the kind of person to experience anxiety but going through a 16 hour flight and customs with a load of stimulants inside me gave me a feeling of panic I had never felt before. Your stomach is the only safe place to put the gear as the only way you'll get caught is if you are profiled or one of the pellets bursts. Don't trust your deodorant can against people who's jobs it is to find hidden stashes in airports. Depending on where you are going, customs could be very strict and your holiday could end in a long jail sentence.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If you really must do it you'll need the following:
      <br/>
      *latex gloves
      <br/>
      *cling-wrap
      <br/>
      *dental floss
      <br/>
      *edible lubricant (get a brand that doesn't degrade condoms)
      <br/>
      *Strong anti-acid
      <br/>
      *Loperamide
      <br/>
      *Laxatives
      <br/>
      *Pasta strainer
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Cut the finger off a latex glove and put create a pellet you feel you could swallow by placing the drugs inside. Use dental floss to tie the end several times as this will not disintegrate in your stomach. Wrap cling-wrap around the pellet. Then put the pellet in another fingertip and tie with dental floss again. Do this until you have 4 layers of latex and 4 layers of the cling-wrap to protect against a layer bursting, because you can never be too safe. It's better to make several small pellets than one big pellet that is hard to swallow and shit out. I do not recommend ever putting more than 500grams in your stomach (even that is very uncomfortable) although there are many people who do 1KG+.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Once you have your pellets ready take a laxative and ensure your stomach is completely empty of food. Then take a couple of anti-acid tablets (to help neutralize stomach acid) followed by a hefty dose of Loperamide (this will stop you shitting for the long flight). Once you have done this, soak the pellets in lubricant and swallow them.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      On the flight it's suspicious if you don't eat or drink, but you will want to avoid doing this as much as possible as you will feel extremely sick if you combine a meal with Loperamide and a stomach full of pellets. I ordered food, put it in a toiletries bag and disposed of it down the toilet to avoid looking like a swallower.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When you get out of the airport go straight to the hotel and take a large dose of laxatives, hold a pasta strainer under your ass and cry in relief that it's over.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Good luck.

       Oh also my [drug]buddy once brought edibles, weed, and her whole smoking bag (pipes, lighters, eye drops, hemp wick [Beeline  :D]) while flying across 1/4th of the country. She has a medical marijuana card and she didn't have any problems at all. She even got a note that TSA or whatever checked her bag (although, I'm not positive it was the bag her smoking bag was in). But I do emphasize she has a mmj card.

       The contact case worked fine with 2c-i. Its also helpful in measuring dosages if you just remember how much you put in each case. I also had some NBOMe in aluminum foil that I just put in a pack of gum. Then I had an alprazolam and proylene glycol solution (250 mg, 125 mL respectively) that I just put in a small sport bottle. On the way back, I wadded some MDMA in a gum wrapper and put it with the rest of the NBOMe. I checked the 2c-i and alprazolam but had the NBOMe and MDMA in my carry on. TSA even pulled me aside for further searching (checked my bag a little and scanned my phone with some sort of wand using microwaves the agent said) and I was still good to go. Lol

      I don't know why people carry stuff on them.  I usually put stuff in my clothes in my checked bags.  I've left stuff in pockets inside cigarette cases, cigar cases, whatever cases I can find. I just leave them inside my jean pockets or any other thick jacket pockets all folded up with the rest of my clothes.  I've even gotten one of those lil stickers and slips that says your bag was opened blah blah and my shit was still in there, didn't even vac seal it, should of though.   However this was more than 5 years ago today I would probably just get something shipped to where I'm going or even ship it to myself.

      I once went trough airport security (intra EU flight) with some weed in my boxers, the metal detector went off and i got frisked, luckily enough they didn't inspect my balls too close, didn't get caught It was quite stupid on my side tho!

      <br/>
      Also once smuggled 1 tab of LSD + a bit of molly hidden in pack of chewing gum. I suppose you must be rather unlucky to get caught with small amounts in an EU to EU flight, there is also no nude-scanners etc.

     im not taking aerosols on the flight i was talking about putting it in my checked in luggage (suit case)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     can any of you clarify if scanners can see through metal? i used the deodrant can method for some pills at new year and it worked also brought back 30g of weed in the same can no probelms, but that doesnt mean it was scanned and got through for all i know it might not have been scanned at all either way
     <br/>
     <br/>
     uk to holland is the flight also the same flight as when i last taken stuff and brought it back. also i know this airport has body scanners when exiting the country, for all i know they could have them on the way in now as well so i dont like the idea of having it on me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     the doedrant can i will use this time will be a new can emptied then same method used, it will be a lynx can, if you guys know what a lynx can looks like you will know that it has a large plastic cover over the top of it and if you pop that off you will see the plastic covers a great deal of the can, i place the can in a toiletries bag in amongst the toiletries bag is a small shaver a bottle or two of aftershave toothpaste ect all the usual shit so that going through a scanner all in a small area is gonna be hard to see whats in it right? well thats my theory
     <br/>
     <br/>
     all advice so far is appreciated guys any more methods that you see more fool proof than mine please let me know, especially SR vendors. i've also thought about using the dvd case with the metal foil as a cover on the case but thats so easy to just open and see where as a deodorant can concealed in a toiletries bag much less sus :)

    I pickup from the airport a person and they just go to the pot store before the flight and put the container in the outside compartment of the luggage. When I help them to load the luggage in the car it smells.

    Not very recommended! But I assume all luggage undergoes the xray scan and some attempt to hide the contents could cause red flags in the xray scan!

    This has probably already been said but within the last couple years or so most large airports have implemented body scanners, which are just xray machines that will definitely pick up anything strapped to your body. I always mail things ahead of time to the location i'm going. Makes me feel a lot more secure than carrying drugs through an airport.

    I would NOT bring anything with you on a flight. Granted, you may get 1000s of pills through, but I have worked at the airport and have seen how things are run. It is a bureaucratic sludgefest so drugs and weapons slip through the cracks all the time, but they DEFINITELY have X-rays with color coding technology (MRI?), air pressure scanners and full body "nude" scanners. Plus every single passenger is considered a potential terrorist, and the people who are checking you barely have a high school education yet are handed some of the most daunting federal powers to date.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you had to bring something, putting it in a tylenol or prescription pill bottle is the best way to go.

Also dont go through the x ray scanner opt for the pat down instead. This is well within your rights and there should be signs around the security explaining this. I've done this several times no problem with up to 3/4 ounce of pot. Trust me this is safer than anywhere in your luggage.

    Yup, for personal amounts, under your balls, if you got balls, and if not, you got an even better natural hiding place ., Choose the pat down over the x-ray thingy, nobody is gonna give you a pat down thorough enough to find your stuff. If it's a long flight and it's uncomfortable feeling, you can reposition it in flight in the bathroom.

    actually once past security there is no need to worry really. discreetly (in a bathroom stall) stash it into your carry on and go about your flight.

    I once accidentally brought an 8-ball of C on a flight into Mexico in a secret stash pocket in my leather jacket. I forgot it was there and found it in Cabo. This was after 9/11 too, so it wasn't the "good ole days". I wasn't wearing the jacket either, it went right thru the x-ray no problem.

    Get a tall black, oblong at the top, container of roll-on (the solid type) stinky mens deodorant. Open it up and cut the deodorant bar in half. Insert your wrapped stuff in there, put it back together and pack it in your luggage with your other toiletries. I've carried small amounts of very well wrapped MJ that way.

    Hiding it in aerosol deoderant is a horrible idea.  Aerosol cans are prohibited from carryon AND checked luggage "except for personal care in limited quantities" (under 3 oz.?).  A metal cylinder in either your carryon or checked baggage is likely to get a second look from someone because they are primarily looking for bombs, not drugs.  A metal cylinder could be a bomb.

    Wearing it on your body is risky nowadays with the naked scanners.  They can see anything strapped to your front or back.  It's been shown that they have a hard time seeing things on your sides (because your sides aren't pointed toward the camera), but it's risky.  If you hide it on your body make damn well sure to not have any metal on and to comply with all their stupid little rules.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree with others who say inside a legal Rx or OTC bottle in your carryon.  That way you have the opportunity to drop it in a trash can if by some miracle there's actually a drug dog in the airport.

       Hiding it in aerosol deoderant is a horrible idea.  Aerosol cans are prohibited from carryon AND checked luggage "except for personal care in limited quantities" (under 3 oz.?).  A metal cylinder in either your carryon or checked baggage is likely to get a second look from someone because they are primarily looking for bombs, not drugs.  A metal cylinder could be a bomb.

       Wearing it on your body is risky nowadays with the naked scanners.  They can see anything strapped to your front or back.  It's been shown that they have a hard time seeing things on your sides (because your sides aren't pointed toward the camera), but it's risky.  If you hide it on your body make damn well sure to not have any metal on and to comply with all their stupid little rules.

       <br/>
       I agree with others who say inside a legal Rx or OTC bottle in your carryon.  That way you have the opportunity to drop it in a trash can if by some miracle there's actually a drug dog in the airport.

       just use your common sense, think about what you're taking, where you're going with it, and is it worth the risk of being caught with.

       regardless... may the Road be with you. :)

    Why can't you just put it in your suitcase? How heavily do they seriously check those things. I'm pretty sure the only thing they do to the luggage is xray for bombs. I've brought plenty of drugs through by simply placing it in my suitcase. I doubt they have drug dogs sniff every single piece of luggage before its boarded onto the plane.

    I stuck a condom of H up my ass for in-flight snorting. I was nodding already, so I slept through most of the flight with it up there. 30 mins to landing, I awoke and ran to the bathroom to retrieve and consume (coming from asia). I snorted it all up but took way too long, flight attendants were banging on the door as we begun to land.

    I don't know if you skipped over my suggestion or not but a ROLL-ON deodorant container packed in your luggage works perfect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive carried small amounts of weed many many times inside and underneath the bar that you cut in half. It would also work for a small amount of anything you might want to carry including pills and powders. If you would like a pic of the container I use let me know and I'll post it and give you the link.
