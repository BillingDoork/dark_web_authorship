    Basically title . Would you be able to see what time ups/fedex/etc delivers in a certain neighborhood then have something shipped to a house for sale or foreclosed then just swing by and grab it off of the porch once it arrives? Obviously assuming you will know the day it arrives cause of a tracking number?

    That's what you're supposed to do... the more illegal, the more abandoned!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A good trick, especially if it's rural, is to put a cheap postbox at the end of the driveway or next to the gate, and then stick a sign on it saying "22.06.2012 - FEDEX DELIVERY FOR XYZ  - LEAVE HERE - SIGNED: dqwdqiojdqw"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always Works  ;D

    are you fucking serious oscar? too bad I have to wait 72 hours before giving you a neg for that dumbass advice. shipping to abandoned houses is a bad idea unless they are freshly abandoned. And even then there are better ways to do it. The idea is to make it blend in with other mail. Do you really think that mail carriers are as stupid as you are oscar to not realize that they haven't delivered to some boarded up house in a year, but suddenly there is a package from the Netherlands to be delivered today. all I can say is you are a stupid fuck!!

    Are you so stupid to think that every fucking mail carrier goes to every "boarded up house" every day just to check if they're still boarded up?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They have a legal obligation do deliver the mail... I'm telling you, just try it. I did say it helps if it's rural, and that's because they don't see them so often so don't know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It always works for me. I've received thousands of packages from even before SR existed and never had any issues. They always read the sign, see the name matches, see the signature and dump the package. They don't give a fuck, they just want to pay their kids college fee's and get the hell out of dodge. If you put a mailbox LIKE I SAID at the end of the drive, they don't even see the house. Obviously you need a long drive, which is why I said RURAL.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    RURAL
    <br/>
    <br/>
    RURAL!!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This isn't going to god damn work in a city ghetto. OK?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A random package from the Netherlands going to a house in the middle of nowhere which has had no mail and the guy hasn't been to in 6 years is less dangerous than a house the guy knows well and knows you well and will want you to manually sign and knows you don't know anyone in the Netherlands!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You don't even need to be there for my method, that's the beauty of it. You can watch it all from some hill top with binoculars.

    so how rural are we talking? like outside of a small farm community in the middle of Iowa where everybody knows everybody? or are you talking about the mountains of Pennsylvania where there aren't any neighbors for miles, but everybody still knows everybody? You would probably be better off doing this jackass plan IN a densely populated area, where the mail carrier isn't going to notice that one of his hundreds of stops along the street had something strange delivered today. I have lived in all three types of places I described, and in the Rural areas, while they are required to deliver the mail, they are not required to not say something about it at the coffee shop to their best friends (one of which is likely the sheriff). But, if you have it delivered to a name that gets a lot of mail at a place that gets a lot of mail, and your packages look like ALL the other mail you get, you are FAR less likely to stand out than the fresh mailbox with a note on it on a lonely country road with an abandoned house at the end of a long lane.

    You're assuming it's only something slightly illegal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets talk 5kg of pure cocaine. Still want it delivered to "a name that gets a lot of mail at a place that gets a lot of mail, and your packages look like ALL the other mail you get" (your home)?

    oh, I didn't read the part where he was recieving 5 kg of coke in the OP. You are right, I probably wouldn't just have THAT shipped to my house (especially with sig required like you posted about) but it still would not be going to an abandoned house. I understand that you want to give people the feeling that your advice will make them safer, fed, but I suggest they read the package profiling thread instead of listening to your cop advice.

    I never said post to their address did I, I said to a real address that receives plenty of mail so that it blends in. That could be a PO box that was obtained with a fake ID among other options. I am in NO way telling them to sign up for a private SR bridge to get rid of their anonymity. and you already admitted to previously being a fed, maybe now you are just freelancing for them. OP, don't have your (likely personal) order shipped to an abandoned house without careful consideration of the risk. Maybe if you sign up for some free catalogs to go there first, and maybe even order a magazine subscription or two, then it will be less specific. If however you are ordering 5kg of blow, there are much better ways to do it than moving to a rural area where the mail carriers know everyone on their route and using an abandoned house there.

    As far as plausible deniability goes you're much better off shipping it to a mailbox owned by you or a friend which gets lots of mail.  If the house you ship to is clean, there is a very low chance of anything bad happening legally.  If you're shipping to some abandoned house/PO box which gets a small amount of mail/other strange place, a controlled delivery will fuck you over.  Nothing is wrong with shipping to a location even if it is directly tied to you or a friend (especially if you don't have any illegal substances on the premises), and lots of stuff is wrong with making yourself intentionally suspicious.
