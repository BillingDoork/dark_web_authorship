    Hey,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a question about SR postage costs. At the moment I am looking buy some MJ from a UK domestic vendor. What I'd like to buy is a selection of 7 different types of their MJ for christmas. My problem is that when I add these items to my SR cart I have to choose which postage I want for each item and by the time I've done all 7 it's added up to quite a lot! Far more than is needed for 7 items to be posted domestically. So my question is, is there anything I can do about this? Do I have to select a postage option for each item or will just selecting a postage option on enough to cover postage be ok as long as I let the vendor know?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm also currently trying to come to an arrangement with the vendor, but I'm unsure if we'll agree to something at the moment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers

    Yeah, Read the vendors home page to see if they offer combined shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or message and ask them if they will combine shipping.

    How does the combined shipping work though? As far as I understand I have to select a posting option for all the items when they are in my cart.

    Most venders will provide a custom listing for ya brother, if you just ask them, they will. Say hey man I want 7 different things and am not paying 70.00 in shiping can you please make me a custom listing or refund me the shipping charges for X?

    Ah cool thanks, I had forgot about custom listings. I'll ask the vendor to see if he is happy to do so. So is that just the way SR shipping works then? By default you have to pay for the shipping of every item even though they could all be shipped together for a fraction of the cost? Seems strange to me.
