    Hey guys. I just started using Silk Road, and I had a few questions. I've learned some things by looking through the forums, but some of the responses contradict each other, and I'd like to get some personal answers to the questions I have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the most part I will probably be importing pills, Molly, and possibly mushies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I avoid buying in bulk? I would like to buy large quantities to get better deals, but not if it's going to put my security at risk. If it is to be avoided, what is a good limit to set?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I avoid sending orders to my home address? I'm renting it with roommates, and it's actually pretty common for us to get mail addressed to the house but for a previous occupant. I'm assuming I should use a fake name for orders, do you think this will be enough to protect myself? If not, should I invest in something like a PO Box? I am likely going to order a fake ID off the site at some point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the delivery itself, my understanding is that signing is to be avoided. Will vendors refrain from requiring a signature (because it is the sender who often requires it in the first place)? So if they ask for a signature (which would probably mean it's a controlled delivery) I should just turn away the package, correct? Am I in the clear if I receive the package without needing to sign?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for any and all help everyone!

    1) Bulk buyers always assume more risk, It is harder to say it is only for personal use. Dealers get much stricter penalties when caught
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) It is best to use your real name, to avoid postal workers noticing anything suspicious. If it gets caught, just deny. Anyone can send drugs to somebody else in the mail, whether the recipient knows its on the way or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3) Each seller has different methods of shipping. Some require signatures, some dont. Check the vendors page or shoot them a message
