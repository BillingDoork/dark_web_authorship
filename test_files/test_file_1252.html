    I found this "service commitment" tool on USPS's website, if you have a general idea of where your package is coming from, you can pretty much know exactly when your package will arrive ignoring unusual delays:
    <br/>
    http://postcalc.usps.com/ServiceCommitments.aspx (***CLEAR NET LINK***)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you know the general location or state, you can google a random zip code to put as the origin, and then your zip code for destination. I played around with it, and found something interesting: For all of my transaction on SR, ive shipped to my old house in a different zip(i still own the hosue) - and all express packages got there by 12pm the next day. However, on my latest pending transaction I shipped to my new house that's about 5 miles away. It's one zip code over basically - interestingly enough while playing with the USPS postage calculator, this changes it majorly. An address 5 miles away basically makes it an automatic 2 day shipment, by 3pm on the 2nd day. I think this is due to my old zip was just barely on the city limits, where as the new zip is outside city lines. Of course some smart vendors mention this, but I just thought a "rural area" meant somewhere in the middle of bumfuck, not 5 miles away from a place I consistently can get packages overnight.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like I said it may be an obvious way, but I just now thought of it, and see a lot of people asking about their packages. It works for priority and other services as well. Since tracking numbers are rarely given out, it's a nice way to at least guesstimate when the package will arive.

    I appreciate you posting this.  But after spending the last 10 or 15 minutes poking around I can't seem to find where you're talking about.  Could you direct me to where I should click or look on the main page perhaps?  Thanks.

    Posting so that I always have a link to this. It's incredibly useful, I found out that my uni address is 2-day for Express along with Priority so I'll be saving myself the extra money from now on.

    good to hear man. It was a huge realization for me as well. Luckily I still have my old house that has the address right inside city limits so I can get express packages overnight there and just drive 5 mins and get it.

    I'm not so lucky... once I go back to uni in a week it's a 3 hour drive to my overnight location, and that's just ridiculous. I'll just be getting all my orders sent Priority and save the extra ~$15 per order.
