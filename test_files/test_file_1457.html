    Just letting you guys know - just because your package is "dog proof" with MBB, doesnt mean the police won't open it. LOL, you're assuming the police will follow the law and not open it if the dog doesnt hit. they MAKE the dog hit (with their own techniques) so that they can open it. just saying

    yes we know this... the whole point is to avoid the dog smell if they are doing random walk throughs. If your package is singled out because you are being investigated you are already fucked.

    Very true, but this sort of abuse of the 4th amendment usually occurs during traffic stops. Between pretext traffic stops and coaxing the dog to alert the 4th amendment is dead on American roadways. The worst part is when subjected to a search that nets nothing you have no recourse to having your privacy violated because police hide behind the old "well there must have been some residue...".

    I had a Midwestern trooper try to explain away a 45 minute search in 20 degree temperatures as "sometimes the presence of fast food wrappers can cause the dog to alert."
