    So im becoming a vendor hopefully within the next fortnight, I have the security aspects mostly covered, but this one problem continues to elude me.
    <br/>
    How do you post anonymously from the Uk to abroad? I was at a post office today and asked about it, Without sounding dodgy, i think i said something like "Is there any kind of international stamps i can use for normal letters getting sent abroad?" answer was no,you would need to come into the post office to get them weighed and posted.
    <br/>
    Then i asked " Is there any way i could do it online?" hopefully if there was i would eb able to find an exploit. There wasnt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now lets say for example i had 25 packages to ship abroad. And went to 3 or 4 different post offices, is the only way to literally keep a hat on and hide your face ?
    <br/>
    What about if they were looking for people that were sending illegal shipments, All they would need to do would be look at say 3 or 4 different Po's cameras and i would be in 4 different post offices, surely that would be a major red flag? Anyone sending say ebay packages would surely send them all in one go, They would know that as they were all different types of letters per PO etc that i was trying to break them up so they werent allin a clump.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone help me with any ways to post internationally anonymously?
    <br/>
    Feel free to PM me and ask for my PGP.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks all.

    Yeah, ive posted letters and cards to the US, all you need to do is stick a few more stamps on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Infact inside the EU, one first class stamp and an airmail sticker is all you need to put on the envelope for up to 100g.

    I just checked on the post office site and it actually says that only up to 10g large letter is covered by a first class large letter stamp.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although im sure i went to the post office recently and they sent like 50g or more on that one stamp.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I actually posted an item to france recently as a small parcel and it was £2.50 and to post the same thing inside the UK is £2.60... dont ask me why.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, you most certainly can post a letter internationally without having to go to the post office. Just double check exactly how many stamps you need for the weight and letter size you are sending.

    Thanks walter, Yeah the post office is strange, I went to 3 different ones and got 3 different answers about it all, I couldent believe it.
    <br/>
    So just to be safe though, You could stick 2 stamps on a letter that may or may not only require one, and it wouldent red flag it in any way?
    <br/>
    Ok mate nice one, any idea where i can check how many stamps you need for the weight and size, would it just be on the royal mail website?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With the Rm going private soon they certainly dont have time to be stopping extra packages at all.
