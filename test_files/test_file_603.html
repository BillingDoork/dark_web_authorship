    but i noticed something strange. on the package there was a barcode sticker.. not a normal delivery conformation one.. something ive never seen before
    <br/>
    it easily came off.. and it had my zip code under the barcode..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i took it off and was like wtf.. fuck it and drove home from my po box.. as if nothing.. but now that i think of it.. wtf was that..
    <br/>

    its probably just a sticker that tells machines how to sort your package.
    <br/>
    and where to send it to

    It could be a new system they are using...either that or your package simply went through a secondary inspection.

    Good to hear you received your sample....was it any good? :P

    If people inspected their non-SR packages they'd find all manner of marks, stickers, tears too. We get a few of these topics every week, understandable though. :)

    I had a problem like that! I know my local postman but this time someone knocked on the door with green shorts on and a Royal Mail bag and a t-shirt ( Strange cause all the postman's around my area wear the same cloths) So any way he asks me to Signed for the package. Don't know if you have seen a Royal Mail signed for sticker Orange (UK to UK) I know this cause i send parcels my self. But he asks me to Signed this white printed paper one on the parcel. Took one look at him and the package and knew it was the Police/Customs. I told he i had no idea what it was and told him i decline to Signed for it he was pissed off about this i knew as soon as i had that in my house they would come running threw that door! But i refused to Signed for it.... Then my mate who lives around the cornor ring's up what's going on down your street riot ran's down there (police). I'm really lucky!

    As people said before, it's likely just part of their automated system.  Most of the mail is sorted by machines and they check the barcodes(and place them) for their own purposes at the larger sorting facilities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's actually some really interesting information in one of the threads from earlier this year about how you really don't have to address a letter or package at all. you can merely imitate those small vertical lines you see near the bottom of domestic mail in the correct pattern and will arrive just fine.  You can also trick the machines into sending mail without any postage on it, but that's just begging for a felony that you'd be too ashamed to explain to anyone. haha
