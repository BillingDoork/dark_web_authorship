    I ordered just a sample of 1g of hash from a vendor in Canada.
    <br/>
    The envelope arrived after just 6 business days (I'm in the Middle East). The envelope looked alright, until I turned it over: it was open and nothing was inside!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, it wasn't opened. It seems like it was actually never closed. You know that white paper you pull of the latch to stick it to the envelope and seal it together? It's still on it. So the envelope was probably never closed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I messaged the vendor right away, maybe they just made a mistake and forgot? Seems real amateur though. Who forgets something like that??
    <br/>
    In any case, the vendor is right now on a vacation and only returns by next week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your thoughts?

    If the vendor didn't seal the package then there is no way to know if they ever put the hash in there or not. Either way they should refund your money (provide them proof) or you should take it up with SR in dispute resolution.
    <br/>
    Don't use this vendor again. Careless shipping techniques could cost you a lot more than its worth for some hash if you're in the middle east

    Seems to me this recently happened to someone else here. Can't find the thread though. Wonder if it's the same vendor.

    Get your money back and move on to another vendor. Something as unprofessional as that should raise red flags o_O Honest mistakes do happen though...

    A lil update:
    <br/>
    The vendor got in touch with me and apparently my envelope just got mixed up with the other envelopes that were already ready for shipping.
    <br/>
    So there was never any actual risk, because the envelope never contained anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was promised a reshipment and that the vendor will make up for the wait. So let's see..
