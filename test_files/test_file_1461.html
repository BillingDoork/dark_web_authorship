    Is it possible and are there stories of past examples? Or is anything small enough to be contained in an envelope not worth LE's time?

    That makes no sense. Do you realy think an LEO will do a CD and be like....we delivered all of your letters into your mailbox but you have to sign for this one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They would just raid your house without the CD.

    I'm confused as to what you're asking.. I guess it would greatly depend on what was within the envelope the size of the envelope, etc.  Be more specific.

    I think you would get a letter or a call, telling you to come over for a little questioning.

    I think it's pretty hard to say for certain because you just never know anything could happen.  But with that being said, it's highly unlikely that for a very small amount anything will come of it.  As long as your envelope is sealed up well and addressed properly it should arrive without a hitch.

    Never make the assumption of thinking you know what LE may or may not do. Just because it doesn't make economic sense or is effective use of resources doesn't mean they won't do it to prove a point.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No offense to the OP but I have lost count of how many threads like this I have read, they are pointless as all they do is invite everyone to post their subjective opinions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know for a fact LE may do a CD for a small order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a general rule though there is normally no follow up for small seizures or at the very worst a love letter is sent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally would not be keen to test that theory though.

    I was wondering how they could do a CD on a waive signature......What I discovered is LEO can put some type of trigger that alerts them when package is open.  When open they bust in. Moral of story try to wait a little bit before opening. This poor guy in Alaska just happened to him. It was probably in a express or priority envelope cause it was 39 grams of heroin.  He went to pick it up from post office probably happy as hell walking out an driving home. When he was in his house he opened it an LEO bust in. It just happened not to long ago....read about it on computer. I know you were wondering about a gram or 2 of something or LSD but I thought people should know about that tactic. I write RTS an wait but I can never wait too long....after reading that story I might try to hold off opening a little longer on next pick up.
