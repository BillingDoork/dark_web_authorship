    I have noticed that recently most of my packages haven't had any postmarks on them. I am not sure if its just my SR orders or all mail because I only really look at that for SR orders. Has anyone else noticed this as well? Is usps just getting lazy lately? What do you guys think?

    This has happened to me in the past. Once with an express envelope the 18.95 stamp had no markings on it whatsoever.

    Apparently in the UK very few stamped envelopes/packages get cancelled any more. This is because most mail is pre-paid/pre-printed so the machines aren't needed to cancel the postmark (aka stamps) as much as in the past. Also volume of mail (since the evolution of online buying, ebay/amazon etc) means a lot of mail get past the cancelling process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had noticed this in the past with certain small ebay purchases. The postmarks (stamps) were coming through uncancelled. Great because you are effectively getting your postage back. If you open the envelope carefully you can reuse it. Obviously stamps are anonymous and SR vendors will use them.
    <br/>
    I did think it was a SR thing, some crafty vendor trick to not give away your location until I researched the matter.

    You may have noticed the terminology, now I'm no philatelist but:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a stamp is the 'postmark',
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and the ink mark/inkjet spots/whatever the PO uses to print over the stamp is a 'cancellation'.

    my first 2 orders came through in one day without postmarks (or cancellations as they may be called).  Basically in the US it tells you where it was shipped from.  I was freaked the fuck out and paranoid for a day or 2 but basically it just seems to be an occasional oversight or laziness.
