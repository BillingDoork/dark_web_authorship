    Considering getting something shipped from overseas. Only ever done domestic to my address, but no way do I want to do international to address.
    <br/>
    What are my options?
    <br/>
    I mean, how does one find a house to get it shipped to?
    <br/>
    Won't it look suspect if out of nowhere this place randomly gets a package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    cheers

    Imagine you are a mailman, and every day you deliver mail to the houses in some neighborhood, day after day. One day in your mail sack you find a padded envelope from across the ocean addressed to the abandoned fucking house that you never ever deliver mail to. Would you be suspicious?

    Don't ship your drugs to abandoned houses. Bad idea. If you really must order international, ship it to your own house or try to rent a mailbox somewhere. Better option, just spend the extra $20 or whatever and get your shit domestic... Is it really worth the stress and risk and worry of waiting out your package through customs?

    So true about mailmen. I once met a guy who turned out to be my mailman at a social function. I told him my name and he told me my address.

    LOL, the mailman will just stuff that envelope under his seat then rip into it during his lunch break and feel great all damn day!
