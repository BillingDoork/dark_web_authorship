    i was given a usps dcn number today for one of my orders from the states, now i know i cant track it the hole way to my door, i have been told it will only tell me when its left the states, witch is a good indication to when it will get here to the uk, but when i go to the usps website all i get is an error message saying "this service is not available right now" but its been saying this all day! its it because im looking at it though a uk based machine or something? its just i find it hard to believe that the website for the postal service in richest country in the world cant keep there website running smoothly? i mean surely they have handfuls of website engineers ready to sort this sort of thing out with in minutes, but its been down all day, you wouldnt find royal mails site down for this long so it must be me???? any ideas?

    That's because US don't provide tracking on international shipments unless it's express mail.
