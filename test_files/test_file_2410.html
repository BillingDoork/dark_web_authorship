    How shoudl i do this so that they dont get crushed or  look suspicious.  thinking about rolling up fabric with a bag with the pills in the middle.  this way it will puff out a big and be soft.

    Your idea sounds like it will make the package more suspicious. I'd leave the pills in the envelope. You should focus on a method of concealing the pills should the package rip open, not adding bulk. All that bulk is only going to cost you more to ship and possibly flag your package.

    Vac seal the fuckers flat between a few sheets of paper. Then it will look like a letter, you dont even need bubble wrap. If you put a shirt it its gonna be a "package".

    Your skittles idea sucks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are a noob - FLAT = BETTER.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can lay the pills flat in small zip lock bags and it is nearly as good as vac sealing them. You want it to look flat and be like a letter and not a package. But they are your pills so do what you want.

    I don't know what kind of pills you're looking to sling... but your 'getting into the game' business plan sucks. There is a really really great thread somewhere here where a bunch of respected vendors cover as much as possible without giving too much information. I know Shroomeister (spelling?) contributed a good piece - do a search.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Long story short - you shouldn't be 'getting into the game' at all until you are 110% prepared to do so. That probably means buying a vac sealer, understanding how you're going to handle postage, having extra money on hand FOR POSTAGE (this doesn't sound like a big deal.. but once you start getting a bunch of order, I promise you you'll feel it), and so on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again, not sure what kind of pills you're shipping... but once you start vending, you are holding people's lives in your hands. If you're packaging gets people in trouble/ruins their lives because you didn't think things through on your end.. not only will you not last around here too long, but it's just a shitty thing to do.

    The above post obviously assumes an illicit substance is being shipped. Either way, here is the thread I was talking about:

    That first page is killer, lots of good information. Then it turns into jibber jabber mostly.

    Don't forget some protection for the pills. They aren't supposed to put a padded mailer through the rollers but i've seen them do it. Make sure its over 1/4" thick or you will need extra padding.
