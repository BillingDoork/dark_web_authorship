    I just got into the vendor game and I was unpleasantly surprised by the high cost of international shipping. In order to get a DCN for USPS International I have to ship International Express at a cost of approx $40 for a 1 lb package. That won't do. I could ship cheaply, International First Class, but I get no DCN and then what's to protect me in an escrow dispute?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I've been checking out the other services offered and I see that I can ship International First Class and add a "Certificate of Mailing" for a nominal cost.  According to USPS:
    <br/>
    <div class="quoteheader">

     </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
     Certificates of mailing furnish evidence of mailing only. A receipt is not obtained on delivery of the mail to the addressee. The fee paid for certificates of mailing does not insure the item against loss or damage.
    </blockquote>
    <div class="quotefooter">
     <div class="botslice_quote">
     </div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Or for around $10 I could add Registered Mail
    <br/>
    <div class="quoteheader">
     <div class="topslice_quote">

     </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
     Registered Mail™ (International) is a service that allows you to register your international mail for additional protection and security.  Features of this service include:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A mailing receipt is issued by office of mailing, and a record of delivery is maintained at the office of destination (the recipient's signature is not required)
     <br/>
     Registered Mail provides the sender with a mailing receipt, and upon request, electronic verification that an article was delivered, or that an attempt at delivery was made
     <br/>
     Registered Mail is handled separately from all other mail, and records are kept by registry number
    </blockquote>
    <div class="quotefooter">
     <div class="botslice_quote">

    </div>
    <br/>
    My question is, is a Certificate of Mailing sufficient evidence for an escrow dispute?
    <br/>
    Anybody else come up with a solution to the high cost of international shipping?
