    I had a similar experience, although my package was domestic.  It was never updated after leaving the facility.  I never got my package.   Not sure if it was stolen or what.

    I had a similar experience myself it left the sorting facility and then nothing for a few days and then it was processed and left that same facility again.  I got my package no problems.  I think sometimes packages get accidentally left on a shelf or in a sorting bin and once they're found re-processed.  Don't quote me on that just a guess.

    Did the tracking number finally just become deactivated or what happened with it, if you even paid attention to the tracking of the package
