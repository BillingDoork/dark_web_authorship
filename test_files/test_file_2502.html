    I plan on becoming a vendor. (adderall obviously &amp; clonazepam) Since all of my orders will be under 13 oz i'll be using first class mail. I'll be using regular postage stamps but I would like to add DCN. The only way I know how to do this is to buy the service at the post office, which kind of defeats the purpose of using stamps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my question is: Can I buy multiple dcn's at the post office for later use? Is there a way to print dcn's online without getting postage as well?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks! All feedback is appreciated.

    Grab extras of the Delivery Confirmation labels (non-sequential eg first + last in stack, or a few randomly from the middle) every time you visit the PO (visit multiple POs), then add the DCN service cost in stamps to your envelope. Hopefully a vendor can chime in with the exact value in stamps that you need to add for first class letter + DCN.

    It can easily be calculated on the usps website. I looked around for a stack of them earlier and there were none to be found. I'll just have to ask for them I guess. Thanks.

    DCN slips are free at any post office. The cost to add DCN is $0.75 which you can just add in stamps.

    Yup. there is  a way to do it. A way USPS doesnt tell you about. Hell they will even tell you you can NOT do it.

    They lie.

    First, you can not use DCN on first-class letters, only first-class parcels, so do not put on a letter. Also, like 77Tjm said, you can just pick up the DCN's from any post office. They usually have them just sitting out for people to grab, so you don't even have to ask for them. Then you just stick it on the package &amp; add an extra $.75 postage.

    The package or envelope has to be at least 3/4 inch thick to use DCN. And I believe the cost is now $.85.

    Keep the stamp in clear view next to the DCN sticker I'm assuming? Or is that a wrong assumption?

    When you get a DCN there is actually instructions on the back of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It goes on the bottom left on the face of the parcel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep all your stamps together top right.

    No problemo.

    Read the back of the DCN, before you peel it to expose the sticky. It tells you right on it. :)

    If you need to drop the actual DCN deliveries at the post office I would suggest to use different post office location each time if possible. Works the best in a large city with a multitude of post offices. Drop the deliveries two times a week and each time try to use a post office you haven't used before. If you need to pay for something, pay in cash.
