    If a package is being shipped from A to B, where doe it undergo customs inspection?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it at the sending location (A), receiving location(B) or both?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is assuming the package is a suspicious one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also is it normal for customs officals at the receiving end (B) to just let packages through if they are cleared by customs at the sending location (A) ?
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    If its true,
    <br/>

    <br/>
    As far as i know , there are only 2 SR users from my country here.

    Packages can be look at in outbound and inbound facilities. However unless there is a blatant reason to look at it, outbound facilities almost never intercept anything.

    Totally depends on which A and B countries we are talking about, some outbound countries do conduct customs checks, I think (do not quote me) the Netherlands may be one of those countries, I would imagine all countries inspect inbound letters/packages etc.

    I believe what others have said is correct: Both countries can inspect the package but usually its the receiving country that does it. Customs is much more concerned about what they let into their country compared to what they let leave their country.
