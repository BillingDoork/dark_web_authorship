    Since I've been on SR not once have I ever signed for anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today while at work I get a call from my girfriend who is freaking out because, despite all my warnings to never sign for a package unless she knows the contents, she signed for a package containing pills.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've ordered from the vendor before without issue and never had to sign previously. Should my girlfriend or I be worried about this? Other than her signing for the package the transaction went completely smooth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope there's nothing to worry about, but appreciate any input. Thanks!

    I would if I could but can't get into contact with them since I can't even log in on SR right now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was assuming if they knew what was in the package that LE would have been at the door instead of a package delivery guy just letting her sign and take the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    More of my worries are coming from her freaking out over it than anything.

    I have received a handful of packages from Netherlands to Canada that had to be signed for.

    <br/>
    Supertrips was probably a few of them.

    if your gf had time to call you and tell you she signed for the package then you are ok.. Usually when they do a controlled delivery they raid the house a couple of seconds after the person signs while mailman is still standing there

    Actually now that I'm actually looking at the package this one is from Supertrips. I forgot I placed an order with him weeks ago!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Damn these drugs are good... making me forget that more is coming haha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for all the info guys. Put me more at ease. Now I need to find time to test the product :p

    I wouldn't worry personally but I wouldn't use the vendor again if you need to sign as its not ideal.

    It all depends on the postal carrier that delivers the package.... some get everyone to sign.. some just don't give a crap..
