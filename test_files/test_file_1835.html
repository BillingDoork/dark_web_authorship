    It depends if it's a brick shaped package wrapped in brown paper and sealed with duck tape that's leaking white power or a discrete parcel.

    LOL ... exactly.

    You can get any size and shape through customs. Its all about the window dressing really .. computer printed labels, clean packaging, neat addresses, business return addreses etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors take not of how packages from legitimate businesses come to you ( adhesive pouches on front, minimal taping etc ) and try and replicate that. It doesnt matter then if its sent overnight or 2 week ground.

    LOL oscar. I understand the importance of discreet packaging however there seems to be a belief around here that no matter how discreet it is the exact same two packages sent at the the same time the one going through express would be under more scrutiny.

    I dont know if that is the case Ben.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perhaps it depends on the carrier ( private v USPS/CP ) ... but the volume of mail that gets sent overnight is quite high ... people these days wants shit when they see it ... So if you are disguising your mail as business style packages I dont think it raises any suspicion using an express method.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But like I say there is a wide variety of "express" services ... you can overnight internationally with UPS/Fedex but not with USPS/CP for instance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Xpress according to USPS/CP is 2-4 day service, not staggeringly quick.

    Im not based in the US so im not overly familiar with all your carriers (i know what USPS is of course) but do some carriers actually do overnight (or closest equivalent depending on geographical difference) international deliveries? I looked up USPS express and they say 3-5 business days international which i agree isnt overly quick but you need to factor in time differences etc
