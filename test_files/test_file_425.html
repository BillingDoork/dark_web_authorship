    i ordered saturday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    obviously you can not ship on sunday
    <br/>
    <br/>
    vendor said it would be shipped out on saturday but that was maybe 3-4pm his time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    could my order be in transit, and vendor forgot to mark in transit?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i am worried, because he has not read my emails that i have sent to him
    <br/>
    other than the one i sent to him on saturday , saying he would probably ship saturday and was printing labels
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyone think i should be concerned? he has 100% feedback from 20 people
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what do you guys think?

    And what would your concern be?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is not marked as in transit, apparently it is not only possible but also the case that it has not been marked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping and marking are two different activities that can be carried out independently from each other. What your vendor has or has not done with your order is something the members of the forum have no knowledge of, so why do you ask?
