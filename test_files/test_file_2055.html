    Dear all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm very pleased to say I've been contacted by my first potential customer from New Zealand who would like to buy BTC using my cash in the mail service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Naturally I've said I'm willing to do this in principle but I was wondering if anyone has any experience shipping from NZ to UK as this is quite a substantial amount of money and I want to be sure it arrives safely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I see NZ Post themselves offer an insured International Delivery option which seems the most lucrative. DHL &amp; Fedex of course can help but they do not allow sending cash and I imagine they'd be more likely to check the package than the regular post office - I'd also worry this wouldn't be as anonymous for my client.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone has had experience with this, I'd very much appreciate your thoughts.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Shoot me a PM mate, I think I will be able to provide a solution to this. It's fairly straightforward because I'm guessing the money is under the 10K mark. If not it's still easy but just takes longer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm quite interested to see you get this fixed because I have a client from NZ who needs BTC but don't wana use the NZ exchange because it's slightly bent apparently.

    Hit me up.
