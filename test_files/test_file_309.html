    I ordered from a respectable canadian vendor, a narcotic drug, it never showed, there's no tracking on the package, and I have not gotten any notice as of now and it's about 30 days.  I'm wondering if anyone out there can answer a couple of questions, namely, if a package sent from a canadian vendor to a us address gets seized, would the seizing party be the american customs or candadian?  And would either of these agencies send a LL to the recipient? How long would it be reasonable to wait to get a LL, one month or maybe as long as 2 or 3 mos?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MOst importantly, the address used, is it shot to hell now? Should I use a different address for any canadian vendors but assume domestic ones are relatively safe?  So frustrating b/c the vendor says that he had a seizure around the time of my order and that from then on none of his shipments made their destinations, however I don't know HOW he knows this, ie obviously he didn't get a LL, so how does he know anything was seized, etc
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pls let me knowi if you a have any knowledge or experience w/this stuff, thanks in advance!!

    Lol, why don't you call both and ask them, only guaranteed way of finding out which of them it was! Some things simply aren't worth knowing, however fascinating you find the answer ;)

    They've probably got more seizures than they can handle right now, don't feel unappreciated if you don't get one ;)

    My take is that LE are fully aware that it's a waste of time to arrest people for SR purchases. Most arrestees will be clued up enough that they will walk. No criminal charge is possible without evidence to connect the buyer. Super draconian new legislation notwithstanding,

    perhaps because his other customers told him? although I agree, he could be shit talking too, you have no way of knowing sadly. I've had a similar experience. You'll probably never find out what really happened, well, not without massively incriminating yourself of course.
    <br/>

    Forget about it, it's almost certainly not coming, neither's the love letter, or the SWAT team. Order some more, from a different vendor, perhaps a smaller quantity (really drives it home how much a waste of time it is to the poor people who have the job to open all these major smuggling packages, only to find half a gram of weed in, LOL)
