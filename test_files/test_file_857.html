    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im looking at becoming a vendor and re-selling dutch XTC pills.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The pills are obviously vacuum sealed from NL, but my question, would I need to vacuum seal pills if I plan to just sell within the UK or would sealing them in the likes of a grip-seal bag be alright?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just curious that is all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    As above, UK mail isn't subjected to internal screening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I feel as a standard, all vendors should be using vacuum sealers and adequate stealth in case an order gets "ripped" open during transit.

    in my eyes like said above everything thing should be vac sealed and definitely done stealthy ,remember the 3 s's Safety,Safety,Safety you never know if/when they could be a sneaky spot check

    Yep good advice above.Forgot to mention good stealth and very important strong and secure packaging. Its not to hard though, have you seen the shocking packages some people send at christmas, falling apart and taped up lol. Yet somehow they get through lol. But yeh you can never be too safe and most importantly you will get a lot more business with people becuase they know they have no worries with your packaging.

    Thanks for the replies.

    <br/>
    Im just looking to get my money together to get a vendor account then the reselling can begin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive been looking for a decent vacuum sealer, but I dont know if there are specific ones or will any work - like ones you can buy in the local supermarkets - the ones you would use to seal open food?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, a label maker.. the ones Ive saw are like £100, for a fucking label maker, seriously?  or am I just looking in the wrong places haha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a good idea for my stealth and it included the product being double vacuum sealed but I then thought "is the vacuum sealing needed for domestic orders?" hence the question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks guys!

    Probably better using mylar foil, can be sealed using hair straighteners and can be useful for stealth :-) think outside the box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for labels, pick a machine up second hand if you're worried about prices. You can also buy A4 paper which has a peel-able section for the outside of package, use a cheap inkjet to print! Most invoices you receive from big companies use this paper.

    Vac sealing doesn't work very well at all for MDMA - there was a test done on here and a sniffer dog could easily find triple-vac-sealed MDMA.

    As a matter of course I ship all my MDMA orders in MBBs and stealthed up, even for UK domestic.

    hmm, mylar foil sounds very useful infact. Did a quick search on where to find it and cant seem to find it, any idea where I could buy it, online, hardware shops etc?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I didnt even think about that for the labels - I have an inkjet printer that gets used on very rare occasions so this could bring the baby back to life!

    Much more smell-proof than vac sealing.

    I think if it's hidden well and not just in a baggie in a letter then you'll be fine.. put some paper in between bulk it out a bit so it's not noticeable, I've never had a pill that had a noticeable smell anyway.

    I'd take MDUK's advice here.  MBB's and Mylar foil are extremely cheap.  There's no reason to build any bad habits or depend on shortcuts when you're just starting out.  Not only does stealth make your customer feel safe but also cared for and attended to.  When someone takes the extra time to make my order as safe as possible I feel like they care about me moreso than someone who just chucks pills in an envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck in your endeavors!

    @MDUK, thankyou, will take all of your advise onboard.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im going to order myself some MBB's and get everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the replies, they are all really helpful!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Already planned my first shipment:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To start with order 100 pills, have 10 free samples to 10 established users to give me 10 decent reviews and transaction history which will hopefully get the ball rolling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then with the 90 left, split it
    <br/>
    <br/>
    10x 5 pills
    <br/>
    2x 10 pills
    <br/>
    1x 20 pills
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FOR THE FIRST SHIPMENT TILL I GET MORE COINS THE PRICES WILL BE A TAD HIGHER THAN I PLAN THEM TO BE:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5 pills = £25
    <br/>
    10 pills = £70
    <br/>
    20 pills = £140
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once I am able to order around 200+ / time the prices will fall giving more room for the customer to earn higher profits if selling them on - this hopefully will attract loyal/more customers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And once I gradually build up a wallet full of coins, hopefully can be ordering 500+ and gradually give discounts for returning customers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No FE, EVER.
    <br/>
    Only established users - somebody said "Atleast 3 months on the Road &amp; $500 spent" - does that seem reasonable to you guys?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think about the above?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    I believe PlutoPete sells this foil, he's UK based. He sells it by the sheet and his prices are pretty acceptable per square metre. What you could easily do is work out how many pill packs you can make per square metre then add the fraction of bitcoin onto your shipping charges so you are basically re-upping from Pluto using SR and bitcoins.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you were to use him, use your buyers account and not your vendor account. Just for security reason :-)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also google A4 invoice paper to get what kinda paper I was mentioning. The label on the paper comes handy and you could even use the rest of the paper as a fake invoice to disguise whatever product you've stealthed inside ;-) I'll venture no further as I feel I've given enough help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try find all this paper locally, just use the internet for references. Always buy your materials cash.

    And you never know when there could be a routine check or whatever.

    <br/>
    It's naive to say that they aren't checked.. Frankly, we don't know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Safety/stealth is what makes this place work and when you're sending illegal drugs you have to remember if the package is caught it could have a significant impact on the buyers life. To the OP, I suggest you get MBB bags/foil. Avaliable on the main site. Cheap and can  be sealed with a clothes iron or a pair of hair straighteners.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Might I add they are way, way more effective that vac sealing as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just remember don't buy them from your vendor account. Never buy anything from your vendor account. You seem like you are knew to the whole selling drugs thing, so I thought I'd give you a heads up. Excuse me if I'm wrong though  :)

    Hello MrAnonymous,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im not brand new to the selling of drugs, I have dabbled in the selling of some coke/meph but nothing huge, but have never done anything like this hehe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are very established, ruthless dealers where I am so dont want to be treading on their toes so I want to take advantage of the SR Market since in my opinion it is a lot safer for the seller to sell on here and there is a lack of UK based sellers selling XTC.

    If you want me to send you some of mine, they're easily big enough for 20 pills (I ship 20 gel caps in them just fine) then they're about 50-60p a go - a bit more expensive than buying straight-up heat seal foil but easier to work with.

     It's naive to say that they aren't checked.. Frankly, we don't know.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Safety/stealth is what makes this place work and when you're sending illegal drugs you have to remember if the package is caught it could have a significant impact on the buyers life. To the OP, I suggest you get MBB bags/foil. Avaliable on the main site. Cheap and can  be sealed with a clothes iron or a pair of hair straighteners.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Might I add they are way, way more effective that vac sealing as well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just remember don't buy them from your vendor account. Never buy anything from your vendor account. You seem like you are knew to the whole selling drugs thing, so I thought I'd give you a heads up. Excuse me if I'm wrong though  :)

    Totally agree on those foil bags they are great and far superior then vac seal.
    <br/>
    I wouldnt say naive i know people who work for royal mail, unles the package is shoddy, suspect or has an odour they dont check domestic. There is no routine checks, however this obvs clould change and yes packages should always be high stealth just incase and its you reponsibility of a vendor :)

     Hello MrAnonymous,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Im not brand new to the selling of drugs, I have dabbled in the selling of some coke/meph but nothing huge, but have never done anything like this hehe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There are very established, ruthless dealers where I am so dont want to be treading on their toes so I want to take advantage of the SR Market since in my opinion it is a lot safer for the seller to sell on here and there is a lack of UK based sellers selling XTC.

    You're going about this the wrong way. If you think £100 for a printer is too expensive then I very much doubt you've put enough though of how you're going to get these pills into the country. Sure using your address/a PO box in your name might work for a while but what happens when 500 pills get screened and stopped? You're going to at the very least going to be unable to use that address again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly I don't know the quality of what you're buying in nor the going price for pills on SR (not my market so I don't look)  but at £5 per pill you'd be better off buying locally, if you know a guy who will sell you 10 you can likely fine someone who will sell you 100s then 1000s.  I also wouldn't put stupid restrictions on who can buy from you seeing you yourself are a new seller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your prices also don't make any sense, why would someone buy 10 pills at £7 a pill if you're offering them at £5 per pill for 5 of them?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go back to the drawing board and rethink this all again. I know you'll probably think my reply is harsh and that as I'm an existing vendor I'm trying to keep all the money to myself and so probably won't listen but oh well.

    I wouldn't have made this thread if I wasn't going to listen to already-established vendor's opinion.
    <br/>

    I appreciate everything you have said and regarding the prices of the pills, that was just a rough draft, not concrete hence why I asked "what do you guys think?" in the previous post.

    <br/>
    The dealers who are local to me would sell me 100s, 1000s but the problem being that on here, the vendor(s) Ive been in contact with can offer me 500 pills for 1000/1200 euro, whereas the dealers here would charge me upwards of £2000 (about 2400 euro) -- see the difference?

    My point was that you don't want to risk security for profit. I don't know the quality of what your local person is selling but £2000  for 500 is being a cunt unless they're like 300mg MDMA each with a complimentary handjob. If you think you have a secure means of bringing them into the country that won't end up getting you caught then go for it. The impression I got from the first post was that you either didn't have much capital or didn't want to spend much capital setting up which is never a good sign. You can't put a price on your own freedom.

    The demand for UK domestic pills is pretty high, but with the interest comes the problems. On a good week you could probably import 500 pills safely, put listings ranging from 5-50, your pills can be gone in 10 transactions or more. There will never be a reliable reseller of dutch pills unless there's smarter means of importing them into the country rather than post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Selling MDMA is better for example, as it's available in quantities via post and sourced locally. Endless transactions.

    Take Reich's warning, unless you plan to sell other goods or goods of similar quality you'll have little chance.
