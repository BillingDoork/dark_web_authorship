    Hi, I'd like to get your guys feedback on a situation that happened to me a couple of months ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I bought a gram of blow, it took a while to get here even though it was sent priority ( I know this is not uncommon)
    <br/>
    When it arrived I was not home, but when I got home I saw it in my mailbox and took it inside excitedly. It just so happens I was in my back yard when a car pulled up in front of my house and a guy with a badge and bullet proof vest got out. Due to where I was, I could see him but he couldn't see me. Once he got out he had a camera with him and started taking pictures of MY house from across the street, got on his phone for a few seconds, then sped off. Does this sound suspicious to anyone? I haven't ordered anything since, out of fear. Should I be worried, should I not order anything anymore? Any feed back would be great! Thanks!

    No, just in regular clothes, but I did notice the badge around his neck. Like one of those federal marshal badges. It scared the absolute shit out of me and I flushed everything, then took the package and put it in a random garbage can.

    My theory is if you live in a wealthy or upper-middle class town, they sometimes have special agents come in town and let them do their thing to clean shit up.  My theory is they cracked down on mail and inspected envelopes most likely with dogs and obviously found something in your package.  It was obviously a Fed if you really did see what you saw, and he probably took a pic for his little gay ass collage of suspicious houses/people.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My town did this bullshit when drugs suddenly became crazy abundant and kids were doing a shit ton out of nowhere like coke and heroin.  DEA and FBI agents came in and everyone started laying low when they realized what was going on.  Needless to say I wasn't even feeling safe about smoking a joint outside in my backyard during then.  There were also tons of undercover unmarked cars, driving even with a gram of bud back then was shitty.

    Too much information. In particular, it was not necessary to mention the name of the vendor nor what was purchased. Remember, cops read this Forum too.

    It's definitely odd, to say the least. Based on your description, this person could have been working for a private security firm. Most of these firms dress up their employees to look like cops; some of 'em even sport badges.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    _If_ this guy was law enforcement, and this is a big if, it is highly unlikely that they would be watching your house over as small an amount of drugs as a single gram.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What you had was not a controlled delivery -- controlled deliveries are typically carried out by police officers dressed as USPS employees. This is done so the chain of custody of the evidence cannot be challenged. Usually, they also ask you to sign for the package, but not always. They just don't deliver and leave packages unattended -- this would allow the evidence chain of custody to be challenged in court.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Furthermore, if your house were actually under surveillance, unless they're really, really clueless, they wouldn't be so obvious as to be wearing a badge and a bulletproof vest. Surveillance teams usually pose as utility employees, e.g. gas, electric, cable, telephone, etc. They usually have their vans painted so as to match the local utilities' fleet. The absolute LAST thing they want is for the target to become aware that they're under surveillance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you _were_ subject to a controlled delivery, you would have been likely been nabbed within a few minutes of retrieving the package -- this is typically how they operate. Usually they give you a few minutes to handle the package, so as to get your fingerprints all over it. They also like it when you open the package, as you cannot then deny knowledge of the package's contents.
    <br/>

    It is a wealthy/upper middle class neighborhood, I know it wasn't a controlled delivery, but I am concerned that my address has been flagged or something of that nature. The thought of it being a P.I. did cross my mind, however, it just seemed to coincidental for my liking. For sure it wasn't my wife as I do not have one lol. I used the vendor's name because I think people should know of suspicious activity like this, as well as hearing if anybody else had this happen to them with the same vendor, as it would raise some questions about them. Not blaming the vendor, but you never know.

    I might have been mistaken about the bullet proof vest as this did happen a few months ago, but for some reason I thought I saw one. Just for safe measure though I haven't ordered anything since. Which is a shame as I don't have another address that I can have anything shipped to.

    my opinion is that it had nothing to do with that pack. Maybe one prior? but to be honest. Controlled Deliveries, they hit you that day! i mean either very quickly or for example. A girl in the paper on the other side of my state. Had a pack delivered from the west coast to mid east. She had a note on the door saying she was in the shower if no answer to leave the package on the porch."smart girl" haha yeah.....
    <br/>
    Anyway they waited over 6 hours until she pulled out with it in her car. pack had over a pound of some bricked bud"they showed pic". She, obviously told on her self and whoever else in on it. she said " it was not hers was doing a favor and obviously told on the other person because her charges were reduced. Snitch! She obviously never been on this rd and never will! Sloppy girl did not know what she was doing, but my point is they may not bust in right away this is why! Even with a pack with no signature. No matter how excited write. Return to sender and let it sit at least a day. i mean that is smart thing.
    <br/>
    now not to be smart ass but where you on blow at the time? could you have been a little noyyed and i mean i am not saying you did not see a ude taking pics. but your unsure of the vest. So i mean, The alphabet boys do not just hop out and take pics. badges hanging if its on a drug investigation. I mean that sounds like a Pi, or could have been a county municipal worker. Taking pics of code violations. For example in middle to upper class.
    <br/>
    my friends parents lived in a middle to upper class place and they had 3 un used cars in the yard and some time later got a letter to remove or fine with pictures of the "infractions" I am not trying to down play it.I mean be smart if you got a bad feeling dont use that addy and keep the house and computer clean!

    I was paranoid. However, I don't believe they were attempting to do a CD maybe just doing surveillance for a future time? I mean it freaked me out, but part of me was like all this for a gram? Hardly think that would be worth busting down a door for, you know? Probably just going to order something else and see how it goes. Fingers crossed hahaha.

    I could think of a ton of things this could be. Do you think federal agents would really pull up in front of your house, get out of a car showing a badge and then take pictures? They're smarter than what paranoia will have you think. It could have been a U.S. census bureau employee correcting errors, or a community/municipal officer doing who knows what. Or like other people said, private investigator. I &lt;3 these threads. I highly doubt you will see the feds coming before they break your door down, unless you have a comprehensive counter-surveillance plan.

    Just think about the fact that you had ordered only (!) 1 gram. Okay, you're US citizen and I know that LE handle things a lot more seriously than here in Europe. Anyway, you ordered 1 gram. Not an amount that could make you look like a dealer. And as far as I know you don't have a clandestine chem lab in your basement, do you?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So just keep calm and take it easy. And as TheGoldenEel said, federal agents are not that stupid. This was probably not a LE agent.

    I feel sorry for you guys in the US with the phony 'war on drugs'.  It's fucked up over there with the LE busting people on minor drug charges, and this 3 strikes rule.  Your corporate run prisons are bursting at the seams, as they build new ones to increase profits and further milk the US taxpayer.  Absolutely INSANE how many US citizens are in jail for drug possession!  ...and they put the prisoners out to work as 'cheap labor'.  What the fuck?   It's the new face of slavery...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm relieved that the UK authorities don't seem overly bothered about drugs for personal use.  At festivals the cops walk by while you're skinning up a spliff, or dabbing a bag of MDMA with your friends, and just say something like 'are you having a good festival lads?'. Turning a blind eye.  They're only interested in dealers and any violence. The way it should be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I certainly can't imagine UK LE doing sting operations on a gram of drugs being delivered to a house.  They don't have the resources or the time on their hands.  There's much bigger fish to fry.
    <br/>

    Well, stay safe, and one step ahead of them.

    I wouldn't worry too much, contraband that has been discovered with packaging way worse than TSR is typically destroyed as former UPS employees have told us in various threads.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it makes you feel better, start using a Live CD to do anything TSR/BC related, remove paraphenalia etc. I think you'll be ok though, and this was probably nothing more than a one-off coincidence.

    In my opinion in the US its an overall paranoia about terrorists and for me seems more logic that the Fed is not so much after who's buying the drugs but who's selling them and in what quantities. Selling drugs is one form of financing other activities, and locating the source seems to be a priority.

    Do you think simply using TOR can get the attention of feds? When I started using TOR I saw a lot of cable company vans around for a couple weeks. Maybe the feds say "Hey, it looks like this guy has something he wants to hide. Lets take a closer look at him"

    I honestly think people underestimate the feds and the lengths that they will go to, just to fuck you over. Even over the smallest little thing. Especially something so blatantly disregarding the law, such as SR.

    Maybe in the USA. Almost anywhere else, I think people OVERestimate the feds.

     Too much information. In particular, it was not necessary to mention the name of the vendor nor what was purchased. Remember, cops read this Forum too.

    Take your own advice and pull your head out of your ass mate. The quoting of the offending information means that even after the OP removes it it's still in your quote...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sigh. No wonder LE laugh at us with this sort of undisciplined posturing by people. A PM would have had the same result but then I guess we wouldn't have known how smart you are right? Edit your post.... and in future don't quote the offending information if you insist on showing everyone how 'on it' you are.

    <br/>

    ya if it was a controlled delivery. your cola woulda been sugar or flower.   So i think you maybe did a couple bumps had the mind going million miles a minute and on that paranoid. And man if you where that far away from him in backyard and him across the road. How did you see the badge maybe but the bp vest? and the gun in a holster? most government officials. roll with the hip holster always covered by a shir or jackey. or even tucked under their tee shirt. I mean seen a lot of reality tv with the DEA remember it was on spike. they always on hip where now one can see or inside the pants holister whci is very hard to see.

    Man i am not dogging on you or anything but clean the posts up as the vets said! Be smart man. I mean if you are that worried do order anymore! FUCKING AT LEAST NOT TO THAT ADDRESS!!!!

    How was your lawn... overgrown and needing to be edged?  since you probably have an HOA, that is how they operate, they come by and take a photo, then send you a $60 "fine" in the mail a few days later.  just a guess :)

    if he really wanted to bust you he wouldn't be wearing his bulletproof vest and badge out in broad daylight...

    lol, either way. this description sounds way more viable than the OP's situation..
    <br/>
    someone has been awake for too long and needs some damn sleep.. but instead they're binging on cola,
    <br/>
    and their newest batch came in.. so cheers to three weeks awake! delirium sets in!
