    Next month I'm meeting up with some friends at a hotel across the country. I would like to have something there from us, but we're all flying and there's no way I'm bringing anything on the plane and we don't know anyone there. I was thinking of putting it an envelope and mailing it to the hotel a day before I leave. Anyone done this before? Advice?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing big, just a couple grams of coke. I was thinking of sending it in a priority envelope addressed to the hotel care of my name. Alternatively, I could package it up in a package inside something else. Or I was also considering sending it express. What's the least suspicious? I figure people probably do this from time to time, but I want to do it as safely as possible.

    Screw shipping it. Seal it up in 2 layers of mylar, trim them small. Then stick it in an envelope, put an address and return address on it and a stamp and throw it in your checked baggage. I would recommend getting some type of card or something and taping the "product" to the middle of the inside of the card and seal it up. Once that stamp goes on it with an address its considered property of the post office and falls under the same stipulations for search as does the mail that's in your mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if they absolutely were itching to, TSA isn't going to and cannot open that card without a postal inspector and a warrant. And they aren't going to spend all that time for something that small. Now if you're packing up bricks in your suitcase, thats a different story.

    Thanks I'll consider it. What about just leaving it in the vacuum seal it came with off of SR and throwing it an envelope? It just makes me nervous at airports in case there's dogs.

    No matter what the weight is i know personally if i had a gram of pot double vacuum sealed I still wouldn't want to take it on a plane with me.  Airports just give me the heebie jeebies.   I have sent myself party supplies to a hotel i was staying at several times and everytime there's never been a problem.  People get packages sent to hotels all the time.  Buisness men who are working while traveling recieve mail and packages at hotels all the time.  Just make sure you write on the package with marker "hold until Arrival"  and make sure the reservation is under the name that's on the package.  I've had ounces sent to me at disney hotels inside the disney parks and have never had a problem.  Enjoy!

    It might be a good idea also to let the hotel know you are expecting a letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been thinking about this as well, only ordering from a domestic vendor straight to a hotel in a country I'm visiting. So the mail would be domestic, and I would have goods in a country I've never been to before :)

    I actually think it's easier to carry that stuff on than check it, personally. Especially with coke, make up some capsules and put them in a vitamin bottle. I usually then put that in my "liquids" bag...hidden in plain site. I've brought weed, edibles, pipes, grinders and never had a problem...not that I'd nec recommend it. If I take molly I'd def do the capsule trick...just fill them completely so they look like supplements and not worry about it. Weigh them out when I get to my destination. Keep the scale in the checked luggage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yeah, shipping to the hotel is probably the "best" idea overall...especially if you are a paranoid person. My interactions with TSA have actually been relatively pleasant, but still lame.

    Just for the record . . .  although I have not verified this personally, don't get lulled to a false sense of security just because you have an stamped addressed sealed envelope &amp; think that it is somehow a federal crime for anyone but the person it is addressed to to actually open it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reality of it is; that it has not yet been turned over to the federally protected system!  Until it is in the hands of the USPS, there are no protections . . .   I have seen mail that has been opened before getting to the post office by officers with no ramifications.  (It did not go to court with this situation though)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But it make no sense that there would be any protection until they had been in the possession of the feds first (USPS)

    Thanks everyone. Think I'm going to go ahead and ship to the hotel to be on the safe side. I'll let them know I'm expecting something before I arrive. I'll probably mail it priority, just to have more control over when it gets there and make it more noticeable to the staff and last likely to be lost.

    If just a few grams carry it with you. As long as its a domestic flight it should not be a problem if you are careful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People do it every single day. I have done it dozens of times over the years (and without sticking it up my ass).

    NCK is correct (as usual). Don't expect a non-poststamped package to give you any additional rights.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would recommend having your favorite SR vendor send your product directly to your hotel. They are experienced with packaging and already have all the supplies.
    <br/>
    Call ahead to the hotel and let them know to expect a package for you. This is common in the hotel industry.

    I agree with Farmer1, Have your vendor send it direct to your hotel. Call ahead and let the hotel know you are expecting a letter or package. But in my opinion I would also print out a fake business letter or package to yourself and mail it to the hotel as well, The reason being in the case that it did get caught, and the hotel tried to use the fact that you called ahead and said you were expecting a package as evidence and that you knew drugs were arriving against you, Then you could still fall back on the fact that you actually did have a real letter arriving.
    <br/>
    Just an idea. :)

    With airline security as tight as it is these days I wouldn't recommend taking it on the plane but if you do make sure it's in a vapor non permeable bag i.e. MBB. Putting the drugs into caps would leave you wide open to being sprung by a drug dog.

    What a sad thing. Who would have thought 13 years ago that it'd be safer and easier to mail yourself drugs on vacation than just keeping it on your person? Crazy.

    It's really pretty easy. Call hotel, ask how your company or whoever should address mail to you while you're staying at the hotel. It's going to be Name, ATTN Guest Services, Hotel, Address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let them know you're expecting mail, and just to let you know when it arrives. If you're mailing it yourself, make it relevant to your stay. If you're getting stuff from a vendor, either just let it come or mail yourself an extra clean envelope with business stuff in it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tip $5 when you get there and $5 when it comes.
