    I want to start offering international shipping, but I can't figure out how to ship across borders without walking into a post office. Do I just package the product as normal, put the address, add stamps, and drop it in the blue box the same as a domestic shipment? If it is that easy, how do you calculate shipping cost? Thanks!

    If you are UK based: http://www.royalmail.com/delivery/delivery-options-international/airmail/prices
    <br/>
    Just weigh your parcel, put on the correct number of Orange Stamps (87p each) to cover the postage fee and then just place it in a postbox as long as it is small enough. You can buy special parcel packets at the post office which are perfect for sending things anonymously across the world.

    Don't forget the customs sticker, without one anything larger than a letter is much more likely to be scrutinized.

    They key to int'l shipping from the states is being able to make your parcels appear to be nothing more than documents.  Documents require no Customs Declaration so you can drop your int'l mailings the same way you do your domestic..anonymously(hopefully)  Learn exactly what qualifies as "documents of no value." .....learn  how to calculate exact postage...use the blue drop boxes(out of any CCTV range)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An easy way to calculate postage is to find an APC and follow the instructions to determine correct postage.  Once that gets calculated you know exactly how much postage to affix(stamps)

    Hey Soulcandy. You are 100% correct. The most reliable and least detectable method of sending anything is through standard mail. So in the USA, having your package sealed properly (vacuum bag, static free bag, etc) and the appropriate postage applied, it is as simple as going to a blue mailbox and dropping it in. While this method is BY FAR THE LEAST RISKY, it does take longer for delivery, as it is not priority mail (which is why much less attention is given to it). This includes domestic and international mailings. So just make sure you have the appropriate postage needed to get your mail to its destination, pick a business out of the local phone book and use that address as your return address (the other option would be simply not putting a return address on the package). My 2 cents only.
    <br/>
    Your thought/hunch/idea is right on Soulcandy, just wanted to give you a "hell yes!" to confirm them! Peace...
