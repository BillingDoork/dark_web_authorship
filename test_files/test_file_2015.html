    I PGP'd the address, did everything I should, and still put Road instead of Street. I'm sure the local post office is smart enough to realize the zip and number range don't match up to the Road, but match perfectly to the Street, but I'm still worried.  I had sent the seller a message saying Hi after ordering. Then had to tuck my tail between my legs and send him another message about my fuckup. No idea how hard it is for a seller to change the address so I just offered to reorder without fucking it up if he wanted to just cancel my original order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That works, right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What would you do differently?  Feel free to bust my balls.

    Just call up the post office and tell them you're expecting a big batch of drugs and to keep an eye out for it. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Depending on the vendor and if they get your message before shipping then it probably won't be a big deal.  If not, the post office should figure it out.  That kind of thing happens all the time.

    Sometimes people make minor errors on the address, that wont raise any red flags.  Most of the time they'll correct small shit like that.  No stress.

    I've done this many times before on legit packages from sites such as NewEgg -- my PayPal had the incorrect address listed for the longest time. I live on a Crescent, but instead I always put Street because I never really noticed (did you know they named streets on how they are laid out? :) ). Anyways, I have never had a package not be received because of this, the postman just tells me to correct it for next time. From Canada Post, USPS, UPS, Fedex, Purolator (I do realize vendors won't ship privately, just listing to show).

    The question I have:  How the heck do you not know your proper address?!?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I was the vendor I'd think you were shipping to some drop location or friends house where you didn't live (or some other stupid shipping idea) and probably would cancel your order altogether.

    The seller can change anything they want providing you got to him before he shipped your package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway - as long as your zip and everything else checks out, there really isnt anything to worry about. I mean I wouldn't do it again, but Im willing to bet a lot of "grandmas" forget St,Road,Drive,BLVD when sending cards and they all still get there.

    USPS is a pretty remarkable animal.

    +1  :)  That's what I tell my customers that fuck up their addresses!

    That almost qualifies you for a sample!  (one more +1)
