    Go fuck your cop buddies in the locker room. Why would anyone tell you how to do what is needed to be done for this whole website to be functional if law enforcement can read it and inform shipping companies? You are either stupid or law enforcement and neither deserve an answer.

    So much ^THIS.Â  There's a reason people don't talk about specifics when it comes to shipping, it gives LE ideas of how to profile packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although I've had my suspicions about LE in certain countries (Australia comes to mind) actually ordering packages to see how they're shipped, and then using that information to help identify future deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All the more reason good sellers should mix up their packaging methods from time to time. Always got to stay one step ahead of LE in this game.
