    Ok the past few weeks shit has been real strange with packages arriving.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not just with me but a fair few mates that order off this site.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We all use the most reputable vendors with the best feedback/stats
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and we have started to notice ever since bitcoins have jumped paast the $30 mark
    <br/>
    and as there has been a massive increase with buyers on this site customs are really
    <br/>
    putting there foot down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    me and 6 other friends have all had packages go missing with in the last 2 weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    even as the first one decided not to show up me and a few mates ordered a few Grams of Ketamine
    <br/>
    which usually takes 5-6 days to land every single time. Now none of them have turned up
    <br/>
    <br/>
    which has made me think That Our customs are really scanning alot of shit coming from Europe
    <br/>
    <br/>

    what do you guys think? can you relate to this?

    What do you and your friends have in common? You all use the same vendors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do me this indicates that perhaps the vendors stealth is no longer up to par, or perhaps they are no longer even sending most of the packages. I don't think you will find this is a general trend. Try another vendor.

    This concerns me. I have a package pending from the EU, which has not been delivered. I am also new, so paranoia is in full effect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can shed some light on the price of BTC going up though, being a mere noob. A little while ago, the number of BTC generated when a block is solved dropped from 50 to 25. This was planned, and will happen again. It is built into the bitcoin network to counteract or prohibit inflation.  This in turn made the demand spike, and is actually quite a good thing. There are decibel points included in the BTC system for a reason. Soon, I figure, 1 BTC will be worth quite a bit, that is most certainly the idea in the first place. (As long as SR prices adjust to the value of BTC.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What concerns me is customs. Are they stepping up surveillance into the US from the EU? If so, I'm certainly concerned. I'm hoping a knowledgeable and seasoned vet of the SR will swoop in with some reassuring words here.  ;D

    Don't get you exercise jumping to conclusions - fact is more people are aware &amp; joining SR and that's driving the price up somewhat also the fact if you have a good btc connection you now have to go thru a verification process thru the normal channels (1 year ago we did not)

    I am flabbergasted that anyone who has the intention to use SR would go through such a verification process.  I refused to, personally.  There is hope, however.  8)

    Stealth has to be upgraded quite frequently by vendors from OS(vendors period for the most part). If not, a string of packages will get intercepted once customs is on to the new stealth tactics. Hopefully your dealing with vendors who realize this and your pack is just moving slow.

    I got 31 successfully transactions from all of the globe (canada, spain, india, uk, nl, belgium, sa) to central europe until last month my first order didn't arrive (sa).
    <br/>
    I wait for over a month now and paranoia mode sets in and i can not imagine that a letter just disappear, but the vendor seems trustfully too.
    <br/>
    I just wanted to let you know, that the contrary (to europe instead from) seems to happen too.
    <br/>
    But maybe I overreacting...  feels bad. We should continue to observe and keep our houses clean for some months.

    At least store/order only personal consume quantitys of your favorite drug, if you can't endure without.

    I've been here more than a year, have had about 25 flawless transactions (and one scam I don't like to talk about) and suddenly 4 things at once just disappeared in transit, from trusted vendors. All going to different locations, too, mind you.

    this thread struck a chord - are all those packages international?  a combination of bad luck and judgement meant three packages were due to arrive a week ago around the same day - none showed.  All from trusted people i've done business with before.  But two of them were domestic and one international.  The day after they went overdue another international package did get through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should i be worried?  probably a local delivery problem but i'm not ordering again until I'm sure.

    I've had my second no-show from O/S, different vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My fault because i didnt wait for my last O/S to arrive, which it didnt, so address was flagged and they snatched the other one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last vendor had great stealth, but no vacuum seal of product, so i think the doggies got my other one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All i can say is, if its for personal use, hang onto it, you just dont know when or if your other order will arrive...

    It's beginning to look more and more like they've definitely managed to improve their ability to check impractically large amounts of mail... depending on how many recent complaints really were interceptions, it could be a pretty substantial improvement too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For what it's worth, I haven't had any trouble, personally, but I'm really, really cautious about who I order from.  Stealth is as important to me as a good product -- so maybe I'm just more careful, who knows.  Either way, thought I'd balance out the "something has gone horribly wrong!" stuff with a little "yeah, maybe, but maybe not," stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is a little disconcerting all the same, since so many people seem to be popping up.

    <br/>
    and walla it turned up on time
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Two things are gong on
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (1) There is an Aussie Customs dragnet. There has been a few high profile bust lately involving large quantities. This I doubt..it takes  alot of resources to monitor everything going into one country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (2) The dragnet is on the vendors end when it leaves the country. This is quite likely, and i have heard through the grapevine from friends connected with LE (who know about SR and are happy to sample the wares), that this is the most efficient way to stop it at the point of posting, not receiving.

    I often wondered about this, Lots of NL based, reputable vendors have had shit go missing with no letter or anything.  Just a theory but If LE from various recipient countries, Aus, USA, UK are pressuring places like the NL to sweep their shit before it leaves as a more effective means, then it would sure as shite explain a lot.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And from LE's likely point of view, the more people who don't get their orders fulfilled and jacked for at least half of their money, the more will be discouraged from using SR

    Assuming our = US, because there's only US and EU. I can relate. Wouldn't put the blame all on your customs, EU does a fair share of xray-ing as well. If they find something it's destroyed. Maybe the US/DEA put some more pressure on EU to not ship so many drugs overseas. the other way around is in my experience no problem at all.

    Australians have no freedoms, so Customs is scanning all your mail using cutting edge technology that can determine the structure of a compound in realtime, on-site. They can detect parts per billion on a swab of the exterior of the envelope and all that jazz.

    Maybe they just ran out of flags and had to borrow yours for a bigger box?

    Or maybe they saw you didn't have a lot coming in and now your box just has a little gold sticker on it.

    Ok so for all the USA people here's how i see things:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -Its a race in the US
    <br/>
    -NL is a flagged country so we avoid it won't be too long before Germany&amp;Belgium follow suit(not saying how soon but its very likely it will occur in general)
    <br/>
    -Following eventually will be the entire EU
    <br/>
    -This is not bad it will just create a huge market shift for Candain vendors
    <br/>
    -The "endgame" of the race is when we get to the point where someone finally puts all this great chem info on SR to use in the US thus USA will have solid suppliers
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now when you get to that last one you can argue that they can then crack down on domestic shipments if we become that Orwellian but at the point where we have multiple US suppliers and labs the market could shift to real world a lot easier then it can now
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I honestly think where going to have dramatic shift in a positive direction one way or another truth always wins :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also keep in mind technology is always advancing and in the not so distant future "Chemprinters" will be in existence in fact i believe a functional prototype has already been developed
