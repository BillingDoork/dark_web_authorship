    So I ordered a couple grams of h internationally into the US and it's been "Inbound to customs" since the April 25th.  I contacted the vendor and he said another buyer received a love letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So of course now I'm paranoid as shit.  From what I've read a controlled delivery is possible with even a personal amount of a schedule I substance.  Has anybody received a love letter for h?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what do you guys think.  Should I spot clean everything?  I'm already basically clean, but I live with some other people who might have a little herb or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also had another domestic order processing before all this happened.  Do you think my address if flagged now even domestic shipments to my address will be scrutinized?  Thanks in advance.

    I woldnt freak out just yet bro, iv had packages International from AUS be there 7 days, and then release.. No issues.. But it normally is 3 to 4 days then they let it go..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your addressed you will not know is "flagged' until and if u get a LOVE LETTER, i hope u dnt have to sign for this package? If you dont think let them drop it off if it shows its moving on the tracking, walk to the mail box, have amarker with u, and get your mail soon as u see this package look at it like hmmmm WTF? Then write return to sender, dont open it and let it sit, if its just droped in the mail and the cops arnt knocking the next day, i woulndt worry bout it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But it does seem to be in customs really long bro, I will admit that.. Is it coming from a flagged country?

    Good tip but bad news.  Seller's profile says all his packages require signature.  And it came from Southeast Asia, so probably flagged. It was a fucking dumb order, I wish I could take it back.

    Hey there, I know who you ordered from and what you ordered. I had the same problem recently and I think it must be related to the ricin "attacks" or something. I have used that vendor 3 or 4 times now and I've never *ever* had a problem. I think we just got unlucky this most recent time.

    That was exactly what I was thinking GreenPEAs.  Thanks for the reply, it's a little comforting knowing I'm not alone.  I'm a bit freaked though, and I will be laying low for awhile.  I just have to make sure none of my hungover roommates signs for anything.

    Don't answer the door when they come.  Let them leave a notice.  Hopefully that'll be your regular mailman.

    Bro i meant just have one close by so if he did not have to sign for it, he could write return to sender right off..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tell me how that is "living in a fantasy world?" In what way is that bad fucking advice bro?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But now that more info has been giving then, that signature is always scary.. But i have sign for a express international package 2 times with no issues (Knock on wood) and another time i had to sign for a international pack from the same place as before not sent express but the guy only fills in a few times a week and when i saw him pull up he said he wasnt totally sure if i was suppose to sign or not because it was international and he just wnted to make sure there was no messs up's or whatever on his end..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Got it, went inside waited Nervously, for 3 days then open up and needless to say it was just a 90 pill count of the original OC 30mg s along with some Shitty 10mg Temezpam which btw in my benzo world do NOTHING!  lol.. took 20 in 2 days didnt even make me sleepy..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I didnt even buy from a vendor just a close friend wwho gets the stuff by the loads an we work out a deal..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But just be cool for now bro, customs from my understanding can take a while at times, iv never had it happen longer than i said nor has any of the ppl who order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next time maybe dont get from any one needing a sig. Pretty sure fuck's all your plausible deniability  &lt;&lt;NOT 100% but pretty sure , so does leaving a note to leave somewhere or calling befoe hand..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1 Thing i hate about Canada order's and certain International order's thats why its best to keep it domestic buddy, or at least from a country NOT FLAGGED ALREADY AND REQUIRING A SIG ON A NICE AMOUNT OF H..LOL.. just My thoughts..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again to the guy who had the remark about the marker and writing return to sender for dropped off mail, i just dont see what fantasy world your in to not think this is a good idea.. To each is own, better safe than sorry if u ask me..
