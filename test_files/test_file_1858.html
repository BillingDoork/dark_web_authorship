    Anyone had any problems? Experiences, advice, what to look out for? The only vendors I feel safe buying from is in the U.S. I will be over the moon if there were Canadian vendors for my drug(s) of choice

    I messaged someone on the forums asking for advice, but they never responded. So it would be really appreciated if any other canadians could tell me what I should do in terms of shipping...
    <br/>
    So far my conclusions have been either to
    <br/>
    1) Use someone trustworthy's house address instead
    <br/>
    or 2) opening a post-box at a storage facility\center nearby.

    Well if you're talking about low quantities of powerders (namely volume), then you are quite safe ordering from any country, as many deliver in discreet "greeting cards" (the best greetings I've ever got lol). Letter-sized, flat mail is often ignored by customs due to high volume, and low risk of it containing any contraband of remarkable significance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With pills its the same, although the thicker the pills, the thicker the package, but still relatively safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Worst case, at least for pharmaceuticals is a seizure by the CBSA and subsequent letter. I recently experienced a seizure from a UK import to Canada from an order purchased thru an Internet Online Pharmacy (IOP). All I got was a letter, and the said pharmacy got the substance in question back. Here's my forum post about the experience, including links to seizure document scans:

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, pharmaceuticals are always safest, and in my case my address was clearly not flagged, as I have received several packages since from various countries, untouched by customs. Personal amounts of anything intercepted generally only results in seizure and potential of your address being flagged. Remember, it's the CBSA that takes care of mail imports, who  work with the RCMP, not your local police department; this is federal, not provincial or municipal, so they have better things to do than attempt to collect evidence to prosecute you for a miniscule portion of a scheduled substance.

    No, a love letter from the CSBA is *not* the 'worst case scenario'.  Having the RCMP bang on your door and ask you politely to come down to the station for a little chat rates a little higher than that.  Ask me how I know?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What happened to me was that a seller FUCKING LIED about where they were shipping from.  Instead of the Netherlands my package was sent from CHINA, and set off alarms at customs and had police agencies contacting police agencies, etc.  It wasn't a very pleasant little chat down at the station I can promise you, and even though no charges were laid I am FUCKING LIVID because now I can't take the chance to order ANYTHING from across the border in any direction.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Up until that point I had about 15/15 packages arrive from the Netherlands, several more from other European countries, and another bunch of the good old U.S. of A.  In fact, I had never lost a package of any kind, for any reason.  Now, I simply cannot chance another interception, no matter how clever the packaging is.  Playing the dumb card ain't gonna fly next time, and next time they will be knocking on the door without warning with a warrant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do your homework, spend a lot of time in the forums, research your sellers to the enth degree, and avoid the mega red flag countries like China - obviously.  They had reams of paperwork from customs, from the labs, and on me.  They scoped me out quite diligently before I even heard a word about it, that spooked the shit out of me too.

    We ship from Thailand and Canadian customs has been a breeze for us so far.  We also do tons to Australia and we have a grand total of only two seizures there in over 14 months of shipping.  Obviously we are sending only very small, extremely discreet envelopes these days.
