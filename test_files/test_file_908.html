    I am a newb, getting ready for first bud buy, personal quan. Transferred BTC from my registered/verified Mt Gx acnt to a recently created Blockchain wallet. I had sent 1 other trans from my personal bitcoin-qt wallet, (possibly not being logged into VPN) to this Blockchain wallet. Sent BTC to initial SR address and a new one (both from the same blockchain wallet address), after resetting PW.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was doing some exploring on SR site, checking offers / vendors, considering shipping options (locations) - never ordered. However, I did order a few things from regular ecom sites. Tracking info showed the driver left it at front door on Thursday afternoon - I was not home when "delivered" and had forgotten about the order until Sat morning. I share the address (single family home) with other efficiency residents and they didn't see the package either. This is the first time I've had any difficulty with any delivery here in 5 years; also, I did receive another package via USPS on Friday. Reported missing package to vendor and UPS. Sunday morning, I find the box outside my door and regular piece of mail addressed to me in the mailbox (not there on Sat either). Even more interesting, the box had been opened from one side; however, the contents were intact and the containers were sealed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas?
    <br/>
    Should I consider shipping SR order to:
    <br/>
    a) new private mailbox address (m/b a UPS store mailbox?), not USPS office, perhaps in Co name
    <br/>
    b) former address (yrs ago) where I still receive mail and family member still lives
    <br/>
    c) my address but use a former residents name (where they still receive some mail)
    <br/>
    d) just do the recommended  - my name &amp; address (perhaps wait until I move - is an apartment building better for deliveries?)
    <br/>
    e) order more stuff from other regular / consumer ecom sites, for testing of irregularities
    <br/>
    f) OR forget the whole thing - assume I'm hot?  (I am using my regular Win 8 OS, m/b my system is compromised (Super ANTI Spyware n Avast AV))
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do I have any options?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am also wondering if I should withdraw those funds sent to SR and start over with another wallet &amp; fogger service, perhaps even a new SR acnt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any and all feedback, questions n/or tips would really be appreciated
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks,
    <br/>

    I'm lost a little?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you mean an sr order got opened but still delivered, if so you have nothing to worry about, if it was opened and the contents were discovered you would never receive the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh yeah you might want to edit this thread a little, your giving a little to much info away.
    <br/>

    I PM'd you.

    So from the sounds of it you received  package from usps and not one for ups? If so ups can open your package without a warrant and I'm pretty sure everyone on sr uses usps because of that reason.. Doesn't sound like you have been flagged sounds like they were suspicious of it and opened it is all... Just my opinion not a expert on this...

    thanks for the FB.
    <br/>
    It was a letter(USPS). and the box (UPS) was opened - but it reappeared on Sunday morning (not there Sat night), as did the letter. I'm starting to conclude it was neighbor related. IYO, why do you think UPS opened this package - I've never had one opened before? The timing of it all is messes with me!
    <br/>
    Thanks again

    I just figured they opened it because you said a letter was attached to it was the letter from some branch of le? if not then it could possibly be the ndn because mail doesn't get delivered on sundays
