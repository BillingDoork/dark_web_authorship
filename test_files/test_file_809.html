    I know I am stating the obvious with regards to CO BUT...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am hearing reports of packages marked in and out of Breck and even USPS PO/LEO encounters at PO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am hearing YELLOW USPS package flyer is tagged with red marker.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Counter then asked customer to step aside while FEDS came from behind counter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know CO is a drug state. Whatever...this happened end of last week.

    I believe I stated all the info that is pertinent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Someone I know - knows someone who is dealing with this issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I described happened to them in Breck'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I knew/when I know more I'll share.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I expressed to them , do not accept/sign anything. they passed the already assumed message along.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know money was first obtained weeks ago leading up to multiple missing packages and reports of LE encounters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The place seems to be hottttt.

    Mark my words, if this is true, they wont stop at trying to keep the weed in CO. Theyll begin to raid majority of the big wigs in CO. Its inevitable, FEDS raid legal farms/ farmers quite frequently. Although the state itself has legalized the drug doesnt mean FEDs wont treat it like it is still illegal.

    Obama administration has been very UNfriendly towards medical marijuana. Since 2011, Justice Dept officials have, in conjunction with certain zealous local DA's busted numerous legal MMJ operations in CA, MT, OR, CO. Which sucks cuz Obama was a HUGE pothead as a kid. Which goes to show you...no matter how cool the person you vote into office, power will corrupt anyone.

    Seven Summit County residents and three others have been arrested after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Summit County Sheriff's Office conducted a joint drug-stopping operation at local post offices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The week-long sting yielded $29,000 in cash, 13.5 pounds of marijuana and marijuana edibles and more than 200 controlled-substance pills, according to a sheriff's office statement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “The use of the mail to transport narcotics and related proceeds is a federal crime,” U.S. Postal Inspection Service inspector Adam Behnen said. “We take these cases seriously and they are priority investigations for us.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    David Alan Bullock, 36, and Preston Lee Davenport, 20, both of Breckenridge, and Danyelle Marie Morrison, 20, and Thomas Alfred Schmitz, Jr., 22, both of Dillon, are facing charges of possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Bryan David Perlman, 40, of Silverthorne, is charged with two counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Kevin Michael McCombs, 33, of Summit Cove, is also charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Jesus Uribe-Salinas, 32, of Dillon Valley, is facing charges of obstruction of a police officer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Individuals in Leadville, Maine and Wisconsin are also facing charges related to the sting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The drug-busting operation, which ended March 1, was part of an effort to decrease the number of packages containing narcotics or narcotics proceeds being shipped through the postal service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a class 5 felony, carries a penalty of up to three years in prison and a $100,000 fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If convicted, Perlman could face up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine for possession of a schedule IV substance.

     Seven Summit County residents and three others have been arrested after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Summit County Sheriff's Office conducted a joint drug-stopping operation at local post offices.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The week-long sting yielded $29,000 in cash, 13.5 pounds of marijuana and marijuana edibles and more than 200 controlled-substance pills, according to a sheriff's office statement.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The use of the mail to transport narcotics and related proceeds is a federal crime,” U.S. Postal Inspection Service inspector Adam Behnen said. “We take these cases seriously and they are priority investigations for us.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     David Alan Bullock, 36, and Preston Lee Davenport, 20, both of Breckenridge, and Danyelle Marie Morrison, 20, and Thomas Alfred Schmitz, Jr., 22, both of Dillon, are facing charges of possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Bryan David Perlman, 40, of Silverthorne, is charged with two counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Kevin Michael McCombs, 33, of Summit Cove, is also charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Jesus Uribe-Salinas, 32, of Dillon Valley, is facing charges of obstruction of a police officer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Individuals in Leadville, Maine and Wisconsin are also facing charges related to the sting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The drug-busting operation, which ended March 1, was part of an effort to decrease the number of packages containing narcotics or narcotics proceeds being shipped through the postal service.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a class 5 felony, carries a penalty of up to three years in prison and a $100,000 fine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If convicted, Perlman could face up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine for possession of a schedule IV substance.

    So the sting is over? Back to business, just more careful than before. I wish they announced the stings before hand, like they sometimes do with DUI checkpoints around here.
