    Experienced smuggler ready on request will fly to destination to consult with the client, at which point i will take possession of the goods that need to be transported. (note:to use this service amounts must be over 1kg) Will travel all over the world smuggling techniques are to a world class standard can take on any amount needed as if need be have the use of a light turboprop aircraft which can be used if the amount is to large to transport on person. The way i work half the money upfront half when i arrive this way we both get what we want.(Note payment is in cash only and when i meet you.) If you are interested list your amount,price and where it needs to be picked up from and go. I will then private message you if im interested in taking up your offer.

    So, you want to find someone who wants a kilo+ smuggled overseas, to pay you half the smuggling fee upfront, then give you said drugs, then what? Pay you again? Where's the protection for the owner of the key?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SR is here to bring together sellers and buyers of reasonably small amounts via post, not people butt-smuggling kilos across the world. Just being real, brother.

    At the preacher:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think it is better for you to buy ah newspaper and looking for some real job, because this what you write here is only ah illusion which you had on (answer A-D):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A) ah bad trip
    <br/>
    B) you just saw too much movies like "Blow" or "Scarface"
    <br/>
    C) you think that you can walk with over 1 kg drug over ah real border without any insurance that you will steal this from the guy you get it
    <br/>
    D)you just ah looser/or ah normal guy and think this business is cool
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sry bro but threads like this are only awesome to read because it is always funny to laugh over 5 minutes, read again and laughing 5 minutes again and again.....haha

    I doubt that anyone will take you up on your offer, but I commend you for the entrepreneurial spirit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, your only real option is to get an introduction to some form of (very illegal) business syndicate that could use your services IRL.

     Experienced smuggler ready on request will fly to destination to consult with the client, at which point i will take possession of the goods that need to be transported. (note:to use this service amounts must be over 1kg) Will travel all over the world smuggling techniques are to a world class standard can take on any amount needed as if need be have the use of a light turboprop aircraft which can be used if the amount is to large to transport on person. The way i work half the money upfront half when i arrive this way we both get what we want.(Note payment is in cash only and when i meet you.) If you are interested list your amount,price and where it needs to be picked up from and go. I will then private message you if im interested in taking up your offer.

    I need someone who can travel to the "spice" Mines of kessel to collect 62.5KG of the very potent drug Glitterstim and then transport it past the imperial blockades and safely deposit the cargo with my contact Jabba the hut, on the desert planet of Tatooine.

    You might have heard of my last drug mule? A Mr Han Solo who is currently frozen in carbonite for failing to complete his last smuggling run for me, so choose wisely before you accept!
