    Ok, so I've successfully placed a few orders domestically in the U.S thus far. I've used my real name a couple times, and a fake name a couple times. Each time I have received the package without any problems. I am now placing an order internationally and I'm wondering if using a fake name is ok. I know that thus far any package that has my address on it gets delivered as residents come in and out frequently. Will this change for international orders? Are international orders address and name verified?

    Yep, even if its in your own name, you can still deny it....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example: ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Look, i've had this girl living with me for a short while, she must have made the order, for there is NO WAY i would EVER order drugs through the mail...i didnt even know you could do that?
    <br/>
    Seriously guys, why would i have ordered drugs, which i DONT DO, through the mail in my own name?" Etc, etc, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Deny everything. :-X

    My understanding is that in the U.S, the USPS uses a database which links the names of the occupants with a particular address. This is unlike countries such as Australia, which doesn't link a name to an address. This has been mentioned many times previously on the forum so do a little research but I'm pretty sure occupants names are linked to a particular address in the U.S.
