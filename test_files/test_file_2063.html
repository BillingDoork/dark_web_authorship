    Of the very few packages i've never received, one of them was $500 cash sent to me by one of the top 10 vendor's here.  So my vote is ... no, don't have money shipped to you in the mail, for whatever reason it seems easier to seize then illegal contraband lol.

    And's lim's guide while pricy is worth it to you haters.  I've read the reviews of several of the people who purchased his services and every single one of them seemed to be very very happy with the investment they made.  Don't hate unless you know what you're hating.

    Not illegal doesn't help you. If it's intercepted go explain to the police and courts why your large drug money or laundering shipment should be returned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Total loss. Guilty until proven innocent. I've read rare cases of people having large amounts of cash confiscated even after proving it came from and was being used for legal activities.
    <br/>

    My bet for anything that goes missing under 1,000 or so and no letter received is exactly what you said. Your friendly postman stole it

    My postwoman is the sweetest old lady though, i'm still miffed I 'somehow' lost $500, doesn't sound like a lot but it is to me fuck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And the vendor is/was an awesome guy, not sure if he's still in the top 10, but he freaked out on me when I went to the resolution center (which pissed and still does piss the fuck out of me).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then a month later I msged him to try and make amends even though I didn't do a single thing wrong and he never responded and cancels all my orders for his digital products.

    Still pissed grrrrrrrr, but it wouldn't be fair to say his name :/

    Could be one of the night crew, or really anyone along the last leg of the delivery chain rummaging through the morning shipments shaking the letters to find money. I read somewhere once that stealing is the #1 reason people are fired from the USPS, and I believe it. See letter day in, day out, you start to get a feel for the ones that have cash. Unfortunately for the person stealing people tend to report this theft to the post office, and their internal fraud division acts fast to catch the person. Hidden cameras are damning evidence

    Ha..what a greedy fucker.  It's not shameful to charge for one's skills but sending shit through the mail correctly doesn't require skill..only knowledge.  I guarantee there is nothing Limetless knows about this game(and wants to charge you for) that countless others won't share with you freely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note to anyone has ever shared their knowledge and experience with this douche-bag without getting paid:  how does it feel to know you are a "mug"?

    also disguise it with something

    one trick i've heard of is buying a deck of cards, emptying out the cards, puting cash inside, then taping it up

    If you send CIM be sure to use a legitimate return address you have access to in case it gets RTS.  This is where having an anonymous PO box comes in real handy.  You won't need to use either your real name or address for the return address.
