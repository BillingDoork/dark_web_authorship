    I have ordered from this vendor before and it is has been 6 to 10 days. Its now over 14 days and i am getting worried, I know its way over the limit for just a love letter. I am hopping to get some advice from other road users. We got to stick together and i appreciate any input you give.. got a few questions
    <br/>
    1.  Is any one else experiencing delays in shipping from Eu to Us?
    <br/>
    2. Its been over 2 weeks i am already worried. how long should i wait before.. i say the worst?
    <br/>
    3. Now, i know what to do as far as my house is clean, i will clean the hard drive and i keep my mouth shut. but what should i expect? like i said i know its a good amount. Well over a lover letter! So please anyone. vets or anyone who has knowledge
    <br/>
    I just want to say thank you in advance for all replies!
    <br/>
    keep on keeping on!
    <br/>
    hope to hear some good reply and wish me luck that it shows, the safe way!

    The only way to have tracking requires signature~ Sucks but i have looked it up.  So, that is not an option or i would have. but thanks for the thought.
    <br/>
    I hope to hear other ideas
    <br/>
    thanks in advance- my SR fam

    I do not think there is too much you can do that you have not already done. Watch the YouTube video of the lawyer that tells you not top speak to the police for a refresher. Mentally prepare for something that will probably never come. Hope is shows up at some point so you do not have to wonder where the damn thing is for 3 months.
