    So I ordered from supertrips 100pc of red ?'s and waited for 3weeks. My friend told me that the concierge in her condominium that a mail arrived but they didnt accept it because my friend wasnt there to receive it. Now I dont know whether it was the package I was waiting for or another. But can this happen or is my friend trying to scam me off my package? However if my friend is really saying the truth will they attempt to deliver it again or do I have to go to the post office to get it? Please help. Btw it was my first order. 600$ may not seem a big deal to you guys but for us it does. Thanks. Also does ST uses express mail or registered mail?? Again, thanks for any advice

    Sounds like you guys didn't really know what you were doing when you decided to plunk down $600 on internet drugs. Did they ever leave a "sorry we missed you!" note? If the envelope is too big to fit in the mailbox or if a signature is required then no they will not deliver it. I'm not familiar with ST's shipping practices so hopefully someone who is will also reply.

    Hey thanks for the reply even man, appreciate it. Well yeah, it was our first time. We just didnt know that we shouldve left an authorization letter to the concierge that they are allowed to receive packages cause we thought it would just be a regular mail. So if anyone here that has ordered from ST any help would be appreciated. Thanks

    So you ordered 200 pills and that you were required to sign the package to receive it? Well I havent read anything like that on ST's profile that orders above 200 requires a signature. Well anyway does ST give tracking numbers as a last resort in case the post office needed a tracking number?

    So, I thnk you may have some misconceptions. Regular mail does not mean it comes in an envelope, the USPS delivers an extremely wide range of package shapes... and sizes. Signature or not, if you think you're going to get a small package when you order 100ct of anything other than blotters, you need to go back to freshman geometry. I don't mean to sound harsh, but no matter what you are ordering, the cardinal rule around here is start small. Learn what different things mean, understand the process, and don't sacrifice large sums of money for your first order(s). And, if you really want to place a large order, come here first: talk about your idea or plan, so we can tell you what is wrong with it and you can address it before you have issues.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have a concierge that intercepts packages, chances are that means you are in a complex where mail isn't like the good 'ol days with a mailbox at each house. For that matter, it sounds more like you don't even live in a house and its an apartment type complex. Limited space in the mailbox, and there aren't many big mailboxes. If there is no space, the postman will attempt to render it to the household it belongs, and if that does not work they will (if available) attempt the concierge. That... is all there is to it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was it under a name that was supposed to be receiving mail at the place? Does the concierge even know that you live there? How long have you been at this residence? When you ordered it, what kind of shipping did you choose when you placed the order, was it express? Priority?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the package, I feel you've already really answered it for yourself. If the concierge had a package come in that he didn't sign for and that you didn't expressley authorize beforehand, then the fault is not with the vendor. The mail got there, he did everything that was within his service to provide. If it was refused, there isn't much you can do about it that wouldn't require raising red flags at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember that as a method to avoid having to drive off customers and earn a black eye amongst veterans for demanding F/E, it is, while still shady, an act of protection for their investment to know that it arrived to YOU. This means for them that YOU have received the package that they sent, and that you should be finalizing your order. This is not unheard of, there are other vendors who have been noted to do this ONLY for large orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advice no matter what, if you are intending on placing a large order with anyone, contact them beforehand and educate yourself on their order process with an appropriate dialogue. They may not have everything advertised properly, or, in multi-person operations its possible they simply haven't been on top of updating their vendor profile fast enough with new policies rather than maintaining updated product. It happens. There isn't a thing on this earth you'd pay a lot of money for without getting some information first... why skip this protective step?

    Thank you very much for having a very detailed information. +1 to you. Well I did put the real name and address and there was no option to choose priority or express mail. I did research before ordering but I guess it wasnt enough about receiving my order because when I searched for someone who has bought from my country nothing came up so I wasn't really well informed on that matter. ST told me recently that it was registered mail not express. Well anyway thanks everyone and to you my good sir. I guess I'll just have to go to the post office, there wasnt really unusual about anything because we used her real name. Thanks! Btw how do you give +1 karma?

    You can't give karma until your post count is 100. I +1'd offbeat for you.

    <br/>
    Yea, your basically left with the option to sign at post office or write off the package. Hard call. Many people have signed &amp; been fine. I'd probably clean house and sign but first scout around and look for any cop cars. Easy to spot in Aus because they all registered in month 10. If you see late model cars that have any chance of being LEO just bail and come back another time. My PO opens at 6am for mail collection through the window, that's your best bet imo.

    Registered mail can have tracking on it, but I suppose he might have said that since you've spoken to him. Ultimately I am hesitant about checking at a post office on failed receipt... mostly because it's had extra time to be looked at. I would be cautious. It is a lot of money to write off like that, but the alternative is a lot less fun. See if ST can determine if its at the post office or not based upon tracking (if he purchased it on the package, I assume on that size he did if he didn't mention it). Depending on the reason that it was returned, the post office has policies for retaining a package over time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do intend on going to the post office, I don't have much suggestion there. On the logic side of things, I would recommend against calling ahead for obvious reasons. Beyond that, someone else around here should have some idea if they've done that before.

See if ST can determine if its at the post office or not based upon tracking (if he purchased it on the package, I assume on that size he did if he didn't mention it). Depending on the reason that it was returned, the post office has policies for retaining a package over time.

     If you do intend on going to the post office, I don't have much suggestion there. On the logic side of things, I would recommend against calling ahead for obvious reasons. Beyond that, someone else around here should have some idea if they've done that before.

       Thank you very much for having a very detailed information. +1 to you. Well I did put the real name and address and there was no option to choose priority or express mail. I did research before ordering but I guess it wasnt enough about receiving my order because when I searched for someone who has bought from my country nothing came up so I wasn't really well informed on that matter. ST told me recently that it was registered mail not express. Well anyway thanks everyone and to you my good sir. I guess I'll just have to go to the post office, there wasnt really unusual about anything because we used her real name. Thanks! Btw how do you give +1 karma?

      Registered mail can have tracking on it, but I suppose he might have said that since you've spoken to him.

    Well, if you don't pursue it at all, it seems its existence is a lot more deniable than if you go ask questions and then refuse it. If someone else opens it and gets caught, hey sucks for them. If the post office opens it and asks questions, then yea, but again... if you never went to get it or even asked about it, who is to say that you ever knew about it.

    No, you just were never in possession of it.  It's more suspicious that you get notified of a package and you completely ignore it.  The only good thing is that you never took possession of it.  They arrest people in America when they take possession of the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Who gets notified of a package waiting for them and says "nah fuck that, you keep it, I don't like getting shit in the mail!" ;D

    The sad part is that I have to wait for 20 days before ST tracks it. That's what he said anyway. I dont want to be the guy "wheres my package could you track it earlier than 20 days" but I guess it cant be helped. :( do they really open mails that stays in the post office for 10 days?

    i havent read the whole thread so sorry if this was already covered, just go pick it up/ sign for it. I just received an order from ST and this was the first time i have ever had to sign for it. I did and there were no problems. He must have made a mistake sending out a recent batch or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as his profile, i have read it a few times, although not recently and I do not remember him saying you must sign for orders over 200, i do remember reading you will have to sign for reships.
