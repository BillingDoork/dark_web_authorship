    Here's my story:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the other day I had 2 express packs en route.  The first came on a Weds, and the postal dude, who kind of knows me, handed it to me outside my house.  He's a younger guy with a very "alt" vibe, tattoos, etc.  On Thursday, I also happened to be outside my house when the same guy strolls up and hands me package #2.
    <br/>
    So he hands me the package, then says, "Wow, two 20 dollar express packs in two days!  What are you doing, selling dope!  Hahahaha!"  I laugh as well in response, like what a funny guy, etc.  I didn't offer up any explanation, just went along with his "joke."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the time, I honestly wasn't sweating this at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I get back inside the house and it starts to really get me tripping!  Now, he doesn't seem at all like the kind of guy who would actually raise a fuss, or report anything -- but still, I've gotta say it was a major mind fuck!  I'm still wondering whether it may be time to stop with all the express packs and just go priority or snail mail for a while.  I typically get no more than one package per week, but still...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd appreciate any thoughts on this issue.  It really got me wound-up!

    It's not so much that I was concerned that "they're onto me...."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But more like, I wonder whether the comment was a sign that Express packs do attract some level of unwanted attention.  And even if it was a purely innocent "joke," it made me wonder about limiting the number of express shipments coming in.  Seems like priority attracts much less attention!

    Very interesting, i myself have a certain number of express packages come to the same drop addy within a week. Although different addys...
    <br/>
    Never gave it a thought until now...If you in USA theres over 50 million express mail delivered every year. THATS A LOT.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would say if you are relatively close to your ('sketchy-vibed') postal worker in age and appearance (basically what im trying to say is if YOU could seem like a drug user TO HIM) then that could be the reason he brought it up...Be honest with yourseld and do you look like a drug-user/dealer? Some of us just got that look...
    <br/>
    This def has nothing to do with LE...at least not yet...i think that this guy knows about and maybe uses SR himself! Its a long shot because , what are the chances?! but it seems likely and if you seem like a drug-user/dealer to him and he knows all about express shipping and SR etc...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This whole situation was highly unlikely but i wouldn't worry. Maybe even next time you get a package from him and he mentions it, continue the conversation and see if SR comes up. Or something that would point to his knowledge about SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wish my postal worker knew about SR and used it too! That would be helpful!

    I don't think you need to worry too much - even if your maildude pointed something out to his manager, it's unlikely they'd bother with a warrant for such a small delivery - but it's worth noting that Express packages to certain residences do stand out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I were you I'd either switch to Priority, or start rush ordering things that aren't SR-related. Let your mail guy think you've got some sort of impulse shopping problem or something - what matters is that your SR mailings fit in well with the rest of your mail.

    Express packs are more suspicious, better go first class or priority. Do you really need your drugs that fast? I prefer paying less and waiting one or two more days...

    Express packages get looked at very hard.....never use them if possible.....first class or priory....much better to BLEND....than to stick out.....it only takes a few more days and way safer.

    but hey it's totally up to you........I can tell you most of the postal people I encounter are nosy.    Nosy postal people are not good.

    "If you in USA theres over 50 million express mail delivered every year. THATS A LOT."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i wouldn't say that that is a lot. Man, that is about .2 packages / letters per person  per year. And most of them are likely to be going straight to a business add or some home business kind of setup.... maybe many of them also look different than the ones he is getting ( i don't know ) with professional design of reputable companies... which i doubt the vendors are able to fake
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is there any possibility that that guy felt what was in the letters?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    id go easy on the express.. or, if want to be very careful, having a buddy send over some some express stuff. and get ur drugs normal mail
    <br/>
    <br/>
    mee no likey that situation..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    he also might be standing in front of you some day, telling you, your package "leaked" white powder and ask for money.

    Nahh nothing is wrong. I would place a btc on the fact that your mailman is probably reading this right now and probably some hero member. :D
    <br/>
    If he is though, you better watch your packages dont start going missing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now do you think his curioity might get the better of him one day? Maybe you should try and hit out with a sort of "yeah right" the missus would kick my fucking ass type things go along with it so he knows your not or thinks your not anyway but is still a decent guy to you. Just try and throw him off the trail a little.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I always have a friendly little chat with my postie. I reckon even if he knew he would still deliver my packages as long as it didnt cost him his job. A lot of them are really just laid back casual guys.

    Ugh. that would totally fuck with my head too, especially since I look everything the opposite of a drug user and am really new to the whole scene. Next time he says something you could say, "Do people really use the post for drugs?" Just to throw him off a bit/have a normal conversation. In the meantime maybe priority mail would be better for you than express?

    now you know if its someone oddly different delivering you a package one day, don't accept. its most likely all fine and dandy.  back in my younger years i would even drive around my neighborhood looking for my familiar mail lady at the beginning of her route,  told her i was on my way out of town, "i need that package now".

    People here worry way too much about CD's. Don't get me wrong, it's good to be cautious, but really it seems almost all CD's happen as a result of seriously piss poor packaging.... or some guy ordering international for bulk drugs in which the vendor used no stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Research and talk to your potential vendors, know their stealth, and have confidence in it. Worry less about CD's, and more about being familiar with your vendor and having confidence in her/his packaging. CD's can be avoided anyhow if you just figure out a way to keep your house clean while receiving packages, and/or simply never do any delivery option that requires signature. I trust my vendors and I don't vendor hop often. I order bulk-large packages from Canada on a very very frequent basis. Never had any problem because my vendors stealth is top notch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The cops/postal inspectors aren't really pro's at catching packages. 99% of the orders here prove that. Even the most minimal stealth can stop an interception.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP, in your scenario I would be more worried about your Mailman stealing your package one day if he knows about SR and looks like that kind of person..... Find an alternate way to receive your mail. Use a PO box or a UPS mailbox, or get a new mailman/address. That would be my biggest concern in your situation.

     Express packs are more suspicious, better go first class or priority. Do you really need your drugs that fast? I prefer paying less and waiting one or two more days...

    I agree.  I would much rather have everything sent via Priority.  That blends in big time.  I wish every vendor offered a slower/cheaper option.  Some offer only Express.

    He may suspect something, but I doubt he cares as long as you don't admit anything illegal.

    Its a big deal for them to open mail, so it doesn't matter if he can suspects something

    and wants to hassle you, which I doubt.

    Unless you say "yea right,  its drugs" he has not cause to search and you should have no problems.

    If he mentions "dope" again, just say

    "Of course not,  that would be wrong. The people of America have right to know their president is not a criminal, and Richard Nixon is not a criminal!!!!", then do your best Nixon imitation (see Futurama) and smile.

     At any rate, based on these comments, I will be switching to priority for a while.

     I also took a small break -- no packages this week.  Luckily my last pack was a one week supply!

    For if he isnt, you wont be getting anymore drops if he's on your postal run...think about it.

    Here's the thing OP,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In so far as my puny brain understands it, Express packages are well known for and have been known for a long time now as the preferred method of USPS drug shipment. There are various posts in the stickies and all over this forum explaining that Postal Inspectors, the guys you really have to watch, know good and well that if they are handling a package that smells like grass and that package is an express package that they've got a good case for trying to get a warrant to open that package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone remembers the baseball player that got arrested about a month ago, he received, I believe two pounds of marijuana in either express or priority packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The USPS knows that because of the extreme time limits that Express packages are under, they "in theory" should be subject to less scrutiny in order to make delivery deadlines. At least, this is what the USPS believes your common drug mailer is thinking. So they use that fact to give Express packages greater scrutiny.  The fact that your regular, street-beat mailman knows that Express packages are occasionally used for drug shipments should tell us that people within USPS, not just Postal Inspectors, are educated to look for certain things. Things like Express packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just be careful man. That's all it comes down to. There is no high, no drug, no pharmakeia in the world worth sitting in a cell for. Just relax. Next time you order, order more than you need right now. It is hard at first. I remember when I got on here I felt like an overweight woman at Golden Corral. I wanted to try it all. After a while though the novelty wears off and this place, more or less, because another market that you transact at.

    Take care my friend and may the Fourth be with you.

    This will give you an idea on how broken our postal service is . Over the coarse of 3 years i have sent over 100 express packages , not small ones either . Guess how many never showed up ?  1,  thats it . I wouldnt worry too much . However if it makes you feel better stick to priority for a bit .

    Express is risky. I avoid it, though, heat sensitive things might be worth it in hot weather.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your mail dude may have been asking to check your reaction to see if he ought to open future mail for you to try to steal stuff. Unlikely, but, test packages that seem like they might be full of valuables seem like a smart idea. Tape up all the seams and use handwritten addresses for reduced stealth maybe? Probably not really a good idea to mail suspicious looking stuff since it would be bad for you addresses reputation in the future.
    <br/>
    What can we use to tell if a package was poked open just a little?
    <br/>
    MBBs maybe. Can you buy the exploding ink bombs here yet?

    Hey Op I was thinking maybe the mail guy is telling you slow those down or be careful /But without coming out an saying it in those words ya know. kINDA Hoping you got the hint when he said that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thats the way i would of taken it if a pretty cool mail guy said that to me. He obviously knows allot of express packs to 1 address does raise flags, What could u need soo bad an soo fast over an over in a week?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless it was money i could understand. Medical supplies you wouldn't order ever day..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I seriously think he was trying to tell you cool the express, he just could not jepordize his job an say it out right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could be wrong, but thats IMO
