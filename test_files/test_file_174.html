    I'm wondering if a GPS-signal emitting device was to be put in a package would that by itself make it more susceptible to interception? Does anybody know if they check packages for interference? The only thing I can think of is it can be mistaken for an explosive device. Any ideas?

    Do you intend to have any "contraband" in the package also?

    I dont fully understand.

    The short answer is "no" though.

    Your package will NOT be "messed" with if you include some type of tracking device. As a matter a fact there are devices made JUST for tracking the parcel.

    GPS needs a line-of-sight to satellites in the sky, there's no way it would work from within a parcel that's in a metal box like a delivery van. You might be able to get a rough location from the cellular network, but we're talking aboutÂ  a quarter of a mile accuracy there. The device would need a WiFi scanner and would be useless in areas that a Google Street View car hadn't been near.

    If a package is going to be tracked it will almost certainly use the latest RFID technology.

    Royal Mail in the UK has a policy against shipping powered on electronic devices capable of emitting or receiving a signal I guess for anti terrorism stuff.

    I should have elaborated. Contraband will be included :) I'm sure it's been discussed on vendor forums a lot and is not something I came up with.
    <br/>
    A device like that may work. What I'd use it for is for large shipments. RFID, as far as I know will only let me know if the package was opened or not after delivery takes place. A good-concealed tracker with a microphone would let you know if the package has been intercepted and possibly listen in on LEO until they discover your tracker or maybe never will if you can conceal it smartly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will do more research on GPS signals, but ability to continuously listen in on everything going on around the package might be enough by itself IMHO.
