    I think you're safe. As long as the packaging is discreet and the vendor has a good record you shouldn't worry so much. :) What did $1300 get you? When i was just a customer buying online i could get at least a package a day and nobody has lifted an eye lid. It's hard not to get complacent though. :&lt;
