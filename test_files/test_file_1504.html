    Recently, my family has gotten suspicious of all the random packages coming to our home address. I don't want to ship my stuff to a abandoned house, or a neighbors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering about getting the largest PO box from USPS in my area. There are no 3rd party PO boxes in my area, so I was wondering if USPS would suffice?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What possible risks/cons would getting a USPS one have?

    You need 2 pieces of valid ID, so its really just as safe as shipping to your house but you do not have to worry about your family finding out about drugs.

    Thanks! I also read you should always use your real name, or sometimes it might get put in a large bin or be looked at as suspicious.

    PMBs are also great, but they usually cost more. I think PO boxes are like $50 a year for a small box.

    What size would you recommend? I was thinking of getting a 11x5.5, but not sure. Do you think that would be big enough for a few ounces (2-4) if I ever got a large order?

    It's up to you. If it doesn't fit than you just need to pick it up.

    I got the middle size and still some times packages don't fit. All the post office does is leave a card in your PO BOX with no writing on it just letting you know they are holding something for you. Give them the card, tell them your PO BOX # and they give you the delivery. If shipped properly, there is NO CLUE on what the product is. I have minor things sent to my home some times also, since priority has been pretty safe and I never have to sign for anything. Since my mail is delivered across the street, I never get close to the post office employee anyway. My PO BOX site also has no cameras and is open 24/7 so I can get my packages at ANYTIME day or night. That is a huge plus for me.,
