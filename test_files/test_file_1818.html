    I was reading over a seller profile on SR who offers First Class and Priority shipping in the US. They put that they prefer /recommend First class over Priority, this is the first I had heard of this. What might be the reason for this? Is it safer (obviously cheaper)?

    That seller is misinformed,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Priority and Express mail for that matter are both forms of upgraded first class mail. My guess is that they believe only basic first class mail requires a warrant to open, which is just plain wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I like priority because its quick and cheap, it also has a more reliable delivery time frame as compared to regular first class mail.

    The following is from www.usps.gov
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can Postal Inspectors open mail if they feel it may contain something illegal?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First-Class® letters and parcels and Express Mail® are protected against search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and, as such, cannot be opened without a search warrant. If there is probable cause to believe the contents of a First-Class Mail letter or parcel or an Express Mail pieceviolate federal law, Postal Inspectors can obtain a search warrant to open the mailpiece. Other classes of mail do not contain private correspondence, and therefore may be opened without a warrant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Postcards, letters, and large envelopes can be sent using First-Class Mail®. This service, along with Priority Mail and Express Mail, can be used for personal correspondence, handwritten or typewritten letters, and bills or statements of account. It may also be used for advertisements and lightweight merchandise. The weight limit for First-Class Mail is 13 ounces. For heavier items, use Priority Mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First-Class Mail includes:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First-Class Mail Cards – the least expensive, most immediate way to reach someone.
    <br/>
    First-Class Mail Letters – the everyday letter mail. Affix a stamp, and drop it in the mailbox.
    <br/>
    First-Class Large Envelopes – mail lots of material in large envelopes.
    <br/>
    First-Class Mail Packages – Letters, envelopes, and small packages weighing 13 ounces or less.
    <br/>
    Presorted First-Class Mail – use it for high volume business mail.
    <br/>
    Priority Mail® - Cost effective delivery in an average of 2-3 days
    <br/>

    Wow, I did not know this. Why is Priority not protected? I don't understand what they mean when they say "Other classes of mail do not contain private correspondence, and therefore may be opened without a warrant."  How do they know Priority envelopes do not contain private correspondence?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @Rocker , you said Priority is considered upgraded first class mail so it is protected, but are you sure about this? If this were the case why would they have specifically mentioned Express mail and not Priority?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that said, don't most vendors use Priority (as one of their options)? Has anyone ever had any problems with Priority in the US?
    <br/>
    I am going to now offer Express and First class, glad I asked this. But let the discussion continue because there are still questions that need to be answered.

    Wow this is the first I'm hear of this too. There must be some misunderstanding. I don't see why class chosen should change the need for a warrant. The only class I could understand this being an issue with would be media mail as its intended for books so perhaps they have the right to open it to make sure its being used properly.

    They are talking about media mail (i.e. when you mail a book or a magazine to someone) and bulk mail (i.e. when you send out a number of advertisements to everyone in a particular area code).  Those can be opened without any further ado. Anything else - including Priority and Express - is considered personal correspondence and requires a search warrant.

    I have found that first class packages up to 3 oz with a DCN cost $3 where Priority/Priority flat rate runs $6.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, if given the choice I would choose a first class package.
