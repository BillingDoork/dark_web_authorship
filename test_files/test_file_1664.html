    I've been out the scene for several years so I'm not really the best qualified person to write this, but please correct me below and I will update my original post
    <br/>
    <br/>
    --------
    <br/>
    Most of this logic applies globally but I wasn't sure about specific laws (controlled deliveries, etc) in other countries so I've labeled this topic as UK
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Receiving Packages from Silk Road within the UK
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Communication with the Vendor
    <br/>
    Use PGP, I won't go into it here, but you can find guides in other forums. Be Safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where should I get it delivered to?
    <br/>
    Ideally, the most secure option is a PO box set up with a Fake ID in an area with no cameras. This means it's usually too time-consuming for police to stake out a PO box 24/7. Let the package sit for a week. Unless you're Pablo Escobar - This is the safest option for large packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now most of you are ordering personal, which isn't as much of a big deal (but that doesn't mean you can be careless!. If you're getting it delivered to your home address - make sure your address is completely clean. Use a name of previous resident that still receives post there (or if that isn't an option - slightly mis-spell your name so you can identify the package). The letter should just pop through your door, but if you get a chap and asked for a signature, deny all knowledge and ask it be returned to the sender. Vendors should never send packages that require a signature - clarify this when ordering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where should I order from?
    <br/>
    Ideally only order from within the UK, there are very few internal-UK customs (there are some spot checks IIRC). If you need to order Internationally drug dogs are only usually trained to smell Cannabis, Meth, Cocaine, and some dogs are trained to smell MDMA. They will not pick up LSD (there is 1 dog in the world that can that was trained as a 'proof of concept') or most RCs or other drugs. This does not mean there are other 'flags', but those are out-of your controlled and down to the vendor (hand written, uneven package - Read this thread for more info - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18904.0)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After delivery
    <br/>
    Ideally, you should not keep the drugs you've received at your home-address. Place them in a safe-house (a friend which has no connection to any illegal activities)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ------
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please correct/add more below and hopefully we can turn this into a decent sticky for the newbies. I will do other topics too (PGP, Getting Bitcoin Safely, Money Laundering, etc) if this gets enough attention
