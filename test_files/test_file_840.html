    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just want to share something:
    <br/>
    I placed an ~600$ order some days ago and now the seller asking for my phone number saying that the courier needed it.
    <br/>
    Of course I refused, but the seller sticks to demanding it. Wtf?!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you think about it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPDATE (2013-03-16):
    <br/>
    -------------------------
    <br/>
    After opening this thread I disscussed things with further with the vendor and I got the feeling, that he just has no idea on howto behave like a SR-vendor appropriately.
    <br/>
    Stupidly this incited me to go through with the order, which I'm now regretting very much.
    <br/>
    I feel very embarrassed for telling this story about my pure stupidity, but now I know better and I hope to warn others by posting this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor I'm talking about is ITALY (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7dca6cc7fe)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chronology:
    <br/>
    1. Placed the order
    <br/>
    2. Vendor asked me for my phone number, which I refused to provide (as stated above)
    <br/>
    3. After some discussing, the vendor suggested to give the courier a fake number (from what he told me I got the impression that this number only would be called in case of a problem with customs for example)
    <br/>
    4. I asked the vendor if he really ships from Italy and he confirmed
    <br/>
    5. One day later he tells me that my order was shipped and provided me with a EMS tracking ID ending with "CN", so he shipped from China...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All in all he broke at least two "rules" by asking for my phone number and shipping from a complete other country. The latter is a serious safety threat to me, because I only wanted to order things from inside Schengen-Area...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just found another thread about this seller: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=133182.0

    That is a serious security breach, if not for yourself you should consider others and report the vendor immediately.

    I see this a lot on here, if you are gonna call out a vendor, WHY NOT TELL US WHO IT IS so that we can also not order from that vendor.  You are not using SR to make friends, so why care about exposing a vendor ESPECIALLY one that does things like this?  Any vendor asking for phone numbers should not be selling on the road, maybe he got arrested and his account is now being used by LE....?

    Well, just a guess here, but the guy does have his address.  If it's an address that's tied to his name, what if this guy only asked for one person's phone number, and all of a sudden finds their account banned for asking for a phone number?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wouldn't be too hard to figure out who bitched.  The fact that they should have their account banned doesn't really enter into it.  Some people are just fucking assholes and want revenge, ya know.

    Proof would need to be provided to SR staff, I suppose, then let us know who it is.
    <br/>
    I would tread lightly, though.  Make sure you aren't jumping the gun and your reasoning is just.

     Well, just a guess here, but the guy does have his address.  If it's an address that's tied to his name, what if this guy only asked for one person's phone number, and all of a sudden finds their account banned for asking for a phone number?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wouldn't be too hard to figure out who bitched.  The fact that they should have their account banned doesn't really enter into it.  Some people are just fucking assholes and want revenge, ya know.

    I guess your right.  As long as this vendor is stripped of his vending rights I am happy.

    Another possibility that hasn't been mentioned (and OP you can chime in if this fits the scenario):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPS will only deliver to a PO Box if they are provided the recipient's telephone number.
    <br/>
    http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/sri/ship_box.html
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There might be similar courier-related restrictions for DHL or FedEx.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which is another reason why it's USPS or bust.

    No, that is not true. I didn't name the vendor before the update of my first post on 2013-03-16 and I have no idea why you keep saying that.

     Hello,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     just want to share something:
     <br/>
     I placed an ~600$ order some days ago and now the seller asking for my phone number saying that the courier needed it.
     <br/>
     Of course I refused, but the seller sticks to demanding it. Wtf?!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What do you think about it?

     UPDATE (2013-03-16):
     <br/>
     -------------------------
     <br/>
     After opening this thread I disscussed things with further with the vendor and I got the feeling, that he just has no idea on howto behave like a SR-vendor appropriately.
     <br/>
     Stupidly this incited me to go through with the order, which I'm now regretting very much.
     <br/>
     I feel very embarrassed for telling this story about my pure stupidity, but now I know better and I hope to warn others by posting this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The vendor I'm talking about is ITALY (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7dca6cc7fe)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Chronology:
     <br/>
     1. Placed the order
     <br/>
     2. Vendor asked me for my phone number, which I refused to provide (as stated above)
     <br/>
     3. After some discussing, the vendor suggested to give the courier a fake number (from what he told me I got the impression that this number only would be called in case of a problem with customs for example)
     <br/>
     4. I asked the vendor if he really ships from Italy and he confirmed
     <br/>
     5. One day later he tells me that my order was shipped and provided me with a EMS tracking ID ending with "CN", so he shipped from China...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     All in all he broke at least two "rules" by asking for my phone number and shipping from a complete other country. The latter is a serious safety threat to me, because I only wanted to order things from inside Schengen-Area...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I just found another thread about this seller: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=133182.0

    Sounds like the vendor is just an idiot. I am pretty positive that you often are required or asked to give a phone number when shipping things internationally. Of course it doesn't mean to give your real number.

    At least I have shipped something international with UPS once and the form required phone number of myself and the recipient. I put fake numbers for both. Package made it through fine although it only had cash in it. Might be best bet to put a real number for both, but not a number associated with either of you obviously, and a cell phone number if possible so it is not tied to an address that does not match where the package is being shipped to.

    Before you completely flip out -- I use to work for a courier and it was common practice to ask for delivery phone numbers. We'd only use it if nobody was home on the receiving end. Not a real big deal. It's your call.
