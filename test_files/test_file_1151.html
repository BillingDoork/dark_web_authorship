    Okay, 13 days ago on Friday i ordered from two separate vendors (A and B), last week on Wednesday i ordered from another vendor C and on Thursday from vendor D. This week on monday i ordered from yet another vendor E. All of those orders should have arrived by now, but only D arrived - two days after ordering it. On top of that, vendor B agreed to reship, but the reship hasn't arrived either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So from 6 shipments (provided that all of the vendors actually shipped) only one arrived! What is up with that? I thought maybe law enforcement is confiscating all letters addressed to me, but then why did D make it through? I live in Germany, so i would like to hear other German's advice. The other explanation is that someone at the post office is stealing my shipments. That some letters are opened by thieving post employees in search for money is a fact and when they find drugs inside i guess they don't bother to reseal them and ship them but just throw them away as noone is going to inquire about this. But 5 out of 6 shipments? If a thief is just randomly opening letters, that cannot be. Maybe they like the stuff i order so much they just go for stuff with my address on it. Man it makes me angry thinking about that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another thing is that all the orders that did not arrive were from vendors i never ordered anything from before. I have bought various times from D but not from the others, so i thought that maybe i was scammed or maybe they forgot to ship or that i entered a wrong shipping address. This is why i made so many orders, but now i obviously won't until i find out what is happening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So i have 3 theories: 1. law enforcement 2. thieving post employees 3. scammers (but 4 of them? 0_O).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, does anyone have suggestions on what to do or what might be happening? Similar experiences?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance.

    I've ordered multiple things at once and it has been okay. But I have been advised against it on these forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look at it this way, if package A is intercepted by the police.... and packages B, C and D are still out there.... chances are they are going to be grabbed also. Now you have four illicit packages coming to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you order just one at a time, then if one is grabbed thats it. And you can move on with another address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry I didn't address your actual concern. But I'm not German. But I think situation above is one to consider.

    Hmmmm second thread of german buyer i found, i am a bit concerned.

    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163130.0
    <br/>
    maybe we can combine these two, i wrote a general long answer in the other thread...
    <br/>
    having more then one shipment on its way is in fact a bad idea in case of LE intercepting your packages...

    Ok so what happened was that one of the sellers labeled the envelope badly and it took the mail 17 days to deliver it. Two vendors had shipped much later than they said. One vendor scammed me (CrystalMethCat).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All of those were somestic orders, normally the mail gets delivered the next day here.

    It's your country, you should know German customs is still as Nazi as ever. I had a friend order some textbooks from the USA and they made him come down to the customs office to receive them, where in front of them they opened the books and leafed through them just to make sure there were no drugs. As far as I know Germany has some of the strictest importing laws in the world. Good luck getting anything there!

    I have a friend who lives in Germany. He can't even order basic non-drug items off sites like Amazon without customs seizing it and demanding he come down while they tear it apart in front of him. As well as the importation of any normal supplements into Germany is prohibited, etc.

    Everything is possible! You only have to be a bit creativ! Or maybe change the business :P !

    Or what do you think why so many NL vendors(MD,speed...) are sending from germany?

    Its only becase it is much easier and safer to export from here!

    Nope... Natural born German living in Germany his entire life... and the Nazi refferences, his words, not mine.
