    Dear SR forum members,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am now, for the 2nd time in my 6 months of making over 14 purchases on the SR, waiting for 2 packages to arrive after what has been 5 days since the shipment was made... The only time I previously waited this long for a shipment was coincidentally the only other time that I ordered 2 things from different vendors at the same time. Those 2 shipments never arrived....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live downtown right by a college campus.. Is it possible that the local officials have seen my higher than normal volume of incoming mail from places like California and Oregon as suspicious and they've maybe seized my packages somehow? I believe BOTH vendors have unconventional shipping methods(large boxes, packages withing jars within boxes within boxes, etc.). I've already gone to the post office to check, nothing is there. Anybody have any experience with missing packages that came in close succession with eachother?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Appreciated,
    <br/>
    JJR

    Multiple orders at same time is fine. It's not uncommon for me to do 3-4 orders all at once. Sometimes I'll get 1 this day and another in a couple days and all the packages spread out over a week or 2. Then times like the other day I check my mail and there are 3 large packages shoved in the box and I already know what's inside!Â  ;D

    I've done multiple orders plenty of times...infact the other day I had 3 Express SR packages show up all at once (very fun day for me!).
