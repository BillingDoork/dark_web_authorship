    hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so i am fairly new here, but really like the concept and totally supported it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope my next question isnt too specific or anything, but i still wanted to ask cause it had me kinda worried.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    last week i made my first 2 orders on SR, being 2x 5 lsd blots from 2 different sellers, 1 from Holland, 1 from Germany. myself, i live in France. 1 of my orders (the dutch one) arrived yesterday, it was all there, fast shipping, great product, but i had some doubts about the packaging. It came packed in a regular sized envelope, in it a folded A5 piece of thick paper. Between the paper, there was 1 normal plastic see-through zip-bag containing the blotters. the zip-lock part had been cut of using scissors, and the bag was taped to the inside of the A5 paper with a small piece of tape that did not cover the entire opening of the bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seeing my order went through French customs with perhaps dogs and scanners and all.. i was wondering.. is this the normal way to package lsd when its an international shipment? or should i at least be able to expect 1-2 vac-sealed bags, or moisture-barrier-bags or whatever? Or am i just freaking out a bit, cause lsd wont get picked up by the dogs/scanners anyways?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thank you for your attention / answering,

    I wasn't aware lsd had a scent.
    <br/>
    I might be wrong, I'm a weed guy so I always double vac pak because I have to.
    <br/>
    There's such a tiny amount of lsd on a blotter I wouldn't be overly concerned.

    100% pure shouldnt.. but i imagine it never is..?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just wanted to know if this is the normal way of packaging when ordering lsd internationally, or that i better search a seller who vac/heat-seals all the drugs they ship

    Dogs don't detect LSD, they can be trained to detect other compounds found on the blotters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is very very rare to find it on purpose, if it was opened it was unintended. If they had found it, they would destroy it and not send it to you after all...
    <br/>

    So, relax and nice trips :)

    I personally would prefer my LSD NOT to be vac sealed, because it means that the LSD must be introduced to a decently large amount of heat (from being sealed), which will degrade it, which is a completely unnecessary waste of perfectly good acid, always a sad sad day when that happens :(
