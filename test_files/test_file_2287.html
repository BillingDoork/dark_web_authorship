    Ok right so I was looking forward to a few g's of Super Amnesia Haze making its way to me, but found this morning a letter from customs ready to greet me instead.
    <br/>
    I was just wondering what next? Is it going to be an issue? Should I call up the number they gave in the letter and say I have no idea why this was sent to me?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package was only 3 g's but I live with a family member and would prefer they had no knowledge of this seizure.

    Do nothing, say nothing. The only thing you need to do, is if cops show up at your door and arrest you - call a lawyer. Can I ask what country this was in?

    Just ignore it and forget about it. The police will more than likely not be involved for such a small quantity.
    <br/>

    Don't use that address for any more orders from SR.

    Thank you very much for the replies, this is what I was thinking, I just wanted a bit of feedback from other users as I only just popped my seizure cherry and to be honest got a little spooked!

    This was in Ireland.

    Perhaps. On the show "Border Security" they showed outgoing mail to Ireland being inspected specifically because of previous tagged exports. Also happens on incoming packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would change addresses on both ends.

    Unfortunately they do! I'm also in Ireland and lost two letters in September. They were addressed with a phoney name so I don't care about the fucking customs letters but the address itself is burnt. and lost.and its not as easy as it seems to get a new one without being asked questions. Nobody want to answer questions. Definitely they must have some action going on at the air mail customs. Confucius used to say: if you don't know what to do just wait.

    A friend of mine from your country got a letter for 150 E. He burnt the letter and didn't order to the address for a couple of months but did order small orders after the couple of months. He used a fake name for the first seizure.
    <br/>
    Lesson learnt by him not to order so big from NL which was a costly lesson!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's up to the law to prove you ordered drugs so never admit to anything or even give them a clue.

    I think something is going on. I've been ordering packages for months and only had one customs letter I think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the last few weeks I had cigarettes seized from Moldova, and ounce of weed from South Africa and half an oz from America. (1 customs letter for the weed and another one for the cigs) Seriously pissed off and I'm not even going to bother ordering anymore....
    <br/>

    There's a new series called "Customs" on RTE1, it only started tonight. All the post comes into Dublin Airport and sent to four main sorting offices...they must have got more dogs the bastards.

    I'm trying to figure out how they could flag an address.

    Would that not involve having to individually check the addresses of every letter?

    From what I've seen, any package seized has been large enough orders and all from the Netherlands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Haven't watched the Irish versions of customs yet but I wonder do they decide to look at all packages from hot spot countries, or is that even possible, or does a sniffer dog go over cages of all parcels from around the world?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they do find a package with drugs, they must key the address into their database and after that, I'd say if a dog finds even a letter as positive, maybe they look at the database to see if it has history before opening it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They seem to be on the ball with bigger orders from the Netherlands but I've seen a lot of smaller orders get through from around the world including Netherlands. Best to keep it small all the time and buy from sellers with A+ packaging.

    In the customs tv show in Ireland, it showed them letting the dog loose in the mail centre in Dublin on a load of bags from the UK. The dog indicated drugs in one of the bags, they emptied it out and the dog then indicated the package that contained around 6 or 7 grams of weed by the looks of it. The customs guy said they will then check the name and address in the system to see if there any previous seizures or patterns attributed to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The dog indicating towards a package in the way it has been trained gives reasonable grounds for them to open and search it, so they don't need to check any database beforehand.
