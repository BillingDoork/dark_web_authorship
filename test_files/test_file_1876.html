    If there were very many more vendors on this site or a site like this then we could seperage vendors out in the USA by state. After that we would order for the vendors in oru state and use a sytsem of dead drop locations instead of using shipping methods to avoid any detection. The rating system would be the same to buy for good vendors. One uses bitcoins liek this or even cash at dead drop. If many more people used this with TOR then it would be a good way to distrubute drugs through the country with the aid of the internet and to avoid getting found. What do you think!

    In theory in sounds like a good idea. But implemented it would bring new problems (ie more scamming on both ends, and LE watching the drop spot)

    This does not sound like a good idea. Couldn't LE just tell a vendor to drop something somewhere, then scope the place out and bust them when they come to drop it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only way I see this working is if the vendor gets to choose their own spot and then after dropping the package notify the buyer where they dropped it. As a vendor, I'd much rather just drop it in a blue box. I'm at 300+ orders now with no complaints...

    The more vague the information about a vendors whereabouts within a particular country the better.  They need security much more so than the average buyer here.  That would allow LE to narrow down, and notice a lot more mail from specific areas.  Besides, if you become a repeat buyers of certain vendors, you'll probably have noticed various things like stamps etc, which can give you some more info if you want it.  We don't want it all laid out nicely for LE.

    I agree with the dead drop concept. Yes the main problem is the vendor being in bed with LE (or being LE) but your already trusting the vendor enough to give your personal address and first and last name.. the concept is based on Idea that vendor are trusted. as long as the vendor can be trusted then it can work perfectly and safer than through the USPS. Especially for bulk orders. This Idea is not old, all cartels mafia etc use this technique everyday flawlessly.

    Sure it would make sense for bulk orders but if you are shipping a lot of packages a day it  isnt feasible. Ideally you'd never want to use the same spot twice and you;d have to make sure it couldnt be found by anyone else. Finding a good spot for that many orders would be a nightmare. Large bulk sure, otherwise I cant see it ever working.

    While it has it's flaws...particularly with regards to the ease of a buyer being scammed. It has the massive advantage of both parties staying completely anonymous. For it to work, the buyer needs to have sufficient trust in the seller, which could be built up through smaller dealings and an effective feedback mechanism (ie SR forums) and both parties would be looking to develop a long-lasting and mutual relationship. It would only prove cost effective with large amounts of small weight, high value goods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How I could see it working (chime in here concealment and caching specialists)
    <br/>
    1. Buyer and seller arrange for a deadrop and come to an aggreement over price structure (ie. all upfront, 50/50 etc)
    <br/>
    2. Buyer lets seller know of a city he would like the deadrop to happen in
    <br/>
    3. Seller informs buyer of an approximate date the deadrop will occur
    <br/>
    4. Seller caches the purchase in a rural area outside the chosen city and after a random amount of hours informs the buyer of the location and description of the cache.
    <br/>
    5. Buyer collect (or if he's smart sends a receiver)
    <br/>
    6. Buyer contacts seller and provides feedback in a public forum (ie. SR)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thing that would be important:
    <br/>
    - Leaving no evidence at the drop site (ie. using disposable shoes/watching tire tracks/prints/DNA etc)
    <br/>
    - Caching equipment (needs to be waterproof and inconspicuous)
    <br/>
    - Turning off any geolocation devices around drop zone (ie phones, GPS)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Possible Anonymity problems.
    <br/>
    - Seller snitches and the pickup is monitored by LE.
    <br/>
    - Seller monitors the pick-up for his/her own information gathering purposes as a counter for a malicious buyer (kind of like delivery confirmation)
    <br/>
    - Buyer doesn't pay up remaining funds as agreed.
    <br/>
    - Buyer threatens bad feedback to blackmail the seller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first two could be counterred by using an expendable receiver. The last two can only really be counterred by the Seller monitoring the drop, thus perpetuating the cycle. It's not perfect by any means when you think about it, but the buyer can obtain more anonymity at a higher financial expense as the seller won't know his drop box or address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I'm not mistaken, was fairly popular in Ex-Soviet states. Surely people have been doing this for yonks and come up with effective strategies for building trust and counterring problems. Any Poles out there? Those guys are fucking ace when it comes to this sort of stuff.

    The main idea is that vendors would have a lot more buyers if people felt more comftorabel. Buyers take a lot of risk on SR. If there was a more anonymous way of receiving packages in the mail then there would be a lot mroe buyers on SR. Dead drop would have to be on a large scale for it to work good I think.

    For sure man! I agree! I think once people get more informed about how you can do it, they will come around. think about it, did anyone think you could get weed or drugs in mail 10 years ago? haha

    Dead drops are in fact an excellent method of product distribution, but you need to be professional about it. If you search the forums I have a list of methods of using Dead Drops properly in a thread and PolyFront has some good leads on the subject too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That does not mean I am suggesting SR vendors use dead drops. It is overkill in this particular case. But for large quantities, it is hard to beat as a delivery method. Contrary to popular opinion, it can actually be done completely anonymously. I already elaborated elsewhere, so if you're interested you'll just have to do a search.
