    So I received 2 packages today, both of which had been opened. I used my real address but a fake name for the order. The products seem to be alright, and whoever opened the packages didn't put any effort into being subtle or concealing the opening. The product was visible in one of the openings. I don't see how any of this can compromise my safety, but shit, I thought I'd ask you guys if I should take any precautions.

    I would be very nervous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd put 20 on it being opened by your curious mailman, wanting to pursue a strong hunch, and then delivering it anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know what he could do about this package so I wouldn't worry much (as he broke federal law opening them), but the next one you order that he spots that he doesn't open will be reported to his superiors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Change addresses if you order again.

    Alright, thanks for the advice, I'll make sure to do that next time. Is there anything the cops can do if they got word of this somehow, though? When will I know if I'm safe? I live in a shitty European country that is not known for its efficient police, mind you.

    Probably that would depend on the quantity and drug you shipped.Â  I would think you are fine as you have the drugs in hand, but personally I would certainly not take any chances, and would move and use the product somewhere else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Eventually the Feds are going to come down hard on SR. With its ever growing exposure this site is going to become much larger than it is now. If they can't get the dealers, they will follow Australia's already effective model of targeting the small guys receiving the packages to instill fear.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just makes the most sense to do it that way. Have a team working to get the dealers, then have a team targeting the end users at the same time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bet some of the dealers on here are cops. Probably established ones with high ratings and shipping good product. They will want access to the dealer forum and getting a solid rep is the only way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd expect this person to be shipping from a country where entrapment laws are much greyer or less enforced than USA and some western European countries. This is a truly international site, and will be targeted by large extensively funded teams from multiple countries all working together exchanging data. Probably will do this for years on end too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I bought on SR I would only buy from USA, Germany, Netherlands. There are probably some other countries in Europe as well with solid privacy laws that I am not Familiar with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All that said you are probably fine, but just move your shit somewhere else to be 100% safe. And if you do get a knock lie your ass off. Cops are exceptionally well at tricking people to admitting things, it's their job.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hell, for all you know I'm a cop scoping out your house trying to trick you into leaving so I can stop you on public property and make up some crime you committed and whoops, what is that, drugs on you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have a good day and keep a look out. This shit is very illegal and a big target
