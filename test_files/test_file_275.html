    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Recently I received a letter in the mail from the US department of justice, saying my name and address had been flagged for ordering illicit substances online. Through some deductive reasoning, I concluded that this had to be due to my presence in The Farmers Market, which got busted not too long ago. About 4 days prior to receiving this letter, I placed an order for 3 hits of LSD from a new vendor, but the order was going to a DIFFERENT address than the one I received the 'letter' at. The letter is coming to me via tracking w/ signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, if my name is flagged, and the pack comes through customs.. will they do a controlled delivery for that small amount of LSD? I'm thinking I probably shouldn't sign for the package, but I wanted some other opinions. I don't know what happens when they 'flag' you.. do they flag your name? Do they flag your address? Do they flag both? It's coming to the same name, but different address then the one that is 'flagged'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think?

    There not going to pull a controlled delivery for 3 hits. It would be a huge waste of time and money for them. maybe if it was 500 hits they would. Your ok but i would only order domestic for awhile.

    I think the justice department just wants to spook you with the letter. I doubt the feds have efficient system in place for intercepting mail to "flagged" addresses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Btw did the letter go into any details?Â  ive heard of people getting letters from customs but never from the justice department.

    I'm wondering if people that got a letter from being on TFM had a last minute order that they didn't have the chance to confirm because the DEA seized the server. A couple days before it happened, i went into my history and saw I had an order that was canceled and my address was still showing, i clicked confirm to have the address deleted, but i don't know if i was too late. How long ago did people get these letters, i heard them talking about it on here, wondering if everyone who got the letter got it around the same time. I had not received one yet, and if i didn't click confirm on that order I might have got a letter........ or I still may get one, who knows.
