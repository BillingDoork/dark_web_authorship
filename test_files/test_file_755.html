    Hey people! Need some information as to how to get pills past the Australian customs?? Any Australian people who buy pills are recommended to answer please. Even the vendors who send pills and get them through the Aussie customs are also recommended to answer.
    <br/>
    Need to get them past the customs for an order. We are looking at about 400 pills and haven't had much experience shipping to Australia before.
    <br/>
    Any help is very much appreciated.
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance :D

    No one is going to post openly here in response to your question, well I bloody hope not anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to find out how it's done you should contact other vendors and seek assistance off the forums and the prying eyes of LE.

    I'm locking this thread before anyone posts anything stupidly incriminating.

    How do you think this thread is going to help you?
    <br/>
    You might learn 1 or 2 new ways to package your items... but then this is on public forum, so customs will just read this... and there goes your new shipping style.
    <br/>
    A vendor isnt likely to help you, because then you will be competition to them... As long as you cant figure out ways to get through customs, they will be making money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All youve pretty much said is "I am a vendor, who doesnt know how to ship or package pills stealthly... in otherwords i will keep your money and you wont get your pills"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You dont need it handed on a platter to you,  just try and come up with some different things yourself

    You do realize that it you have just as much chance as sending pills stealth or no stealth and getting them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your package gets pulled into a bundle for a random search it will more than likely get picked up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just sayin
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I say just ship them in the best "vapor" proof, mylar bags they are selling on here and cross your fingers.
