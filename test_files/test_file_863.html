    About three weeks ago I got a pretty hefty (600$) refund after SuperTrips' bullshit and did druggie thing and instantly ordered 5 packages to my house - we get at least a package a day so I wasn't worried about a few extras. 2 days later I had my order from GlassHouse (AMAZING vendor btw, best I've ordered from all around and a really nice guy) so I wasn't stressing about the others, even when I was up to a week. Finally I messaged the vendors for the tracking numbers of the other packages aaaaaaaaaand
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I "moved - left no address" on four packages, 2 from the road, which is completely fucking bullshit. I've lived in that house going on 5 years and get mail there every fuckin day! He must have arbitrarily decided not to deliver my mail that one day, i don't even see what else it could have been.. to top it all off, I got my overseas order on friday with no problems. Did I move back???? What?? I'm about to jump the mail man. that fucker.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But now what? Two of the vendors graciously agreed to reship me half, and I'm in resolution to try and get a half refund from the last one. Shit sucks, especially when there was no rhyme or reason to it at all.

    Did you copy/paste your address for those orders?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check your address under ZIP code lookup on usps.com (assuming you are in the US).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ask the mailman wtf is up.

    Yeah I did, which is why this whole thing blew my mind. My jaw literally dropped when I looked up the first tracking code and saw "moved - left no address." Fuckin unreal.
