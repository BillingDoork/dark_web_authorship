    My good friend owns a breeding kennel for one the dogs most used by customs and police for tracking substances, money, people and whatever. Recently he got there a new "stud dog" that was retired from police :). It is specially trained for drug sniffings and served 5 years, busted out many not-so-bright people :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So we bought a vacuum machine + some weed, amphetamine, cocaine and mdma. We tried single vacuum, double vacuum and triple vacuum. Each layer was rubbed with alcohol and different gloves were used to pack the stuff in and for other handling. Packaging was done in different premises with different clothing on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it did not get it at 1st time, we tried several different time spans for same packages to see if they start to leak the smell. All of these "experiments" were done twice to get constant data (Yes, I like Mythbusters!). I will post more results in few days, I still have the same packages we used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am not sure if I have mentioned my home country in some of my previous messages, propably yes but just in case, it is a place with notorious customs in Scandinavia :).
    <br/>
    Weed:
    <br/>
    1 layer, 15 mins both times
    <br/>
    2 layers, 12 hours 1st, 3 days 2nd
    <br/>
    3 layers: not after 48 hours, but got after 5 days. 2nd was not detected after 5 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Amfetamine:
    <br/>
    No reaction at all to any packages in vacuumsafter 5 days. No reaction to speed in plastic bag either. I think it may have something to do with the speed itself, the stuff that is mostly sold here is totally different than the "ducth paste" we used. Our stuff origins from Baltic countries and Russia, they use different precursos and methods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cocaine:
    <br/>
    After 5 days no reaction to any package. Obviously he still knows it´s coke and a no-no, he found three stashes in plastic bags with no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MDMA:
    <br/>
    Dog went wild on this, I think it was his favourite:
    <br/>
    1 layer: both 15 min
    <br/>
    2 layer: 1st 15min, 2nd 1 hour
    <br/>
    3 layers: 1st not after 5 days, 2nd after 24 hours.

    Thanks for the info, but I am a little unclear
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you say
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Weed:
    <br/>
    1 layer, 15 mins both times
    <br/>
    2 layers, 12 hours 1st, 3 days 2nd
    <br/>
    3 layers: not after 48 hours, but got after 5 days. 2nd was not detected after 5 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you mean when using 1 layer it took the dog 15 minutes to find it?
    <br/>
    2 layers it took the dog 12 hours?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also same with
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cocaine:
    <br/>
    After 5 days no reaction to any package. Obviously he still knows it´s coke and a no-no, he found three stashes in plastic bags with no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you mean you left it in the package for 5 days and then sent the dog? also you saying he had no reaction but the dog knows its a no-no??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry but im just confused, I appreciate the info, just want some clarity  8)

    the weed was in package for 15 minutes, then it was hidden among other things. also cocaine had been 5 days in same package, then hidden. this was to test if the packages start to leak smell outside. dog did not smell the cocaine through vacuum package even it was there for 5 days. but when it was in ziplock bag he found it right away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it came quite clear that vacuum packages do leak smell outside in time.

    VERY AWESOME!! I had head vac seal will eventually leak enough for dog to smell after some time! good to know that exact method works, but I don't believe hardly any weed vendors actually use gloves and/or clean each layer with alcohol after they seal it. If any do, I haven't heard or seen it on their pages. I would assume they would advertise that! Another think is really big issue now is the heat. its obvious heat will increase the smell of weed, and being shipped on extremely hot trucks and other hot areas/equipment. I would love to know if you used those variables on your experiment if you would get different reaction! Also what amount of weed did you use, I would think the a gram would greatly differ from an oz or qp! those are more realistic environments that our packages go tho each time. btw I am not dogging the way you did at all!! I just wouldn't  want any false positives that could get around that would cause vendors to relax about the smell of shipments! I know their has to be a fool proof way if we all put our ideas together, and do experiments like you have done and other test, then we could find it! trial and error right? great to get failures done like this way in controlled environment! again Bravo guys!

    Mylar bags are made of various things, usually layers of polymers and foil. Used a lot in long term food storage, used in things like Ready Meals for the Army. I'm sure you've seen mylar balloons before as well, you know the ones they fill with helium that are in weird shapes?

    Thanks for this valuable information!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if you'd be able to test metal-laminate bags (as suggested by some posters to be more secure than vacuum-seal plastic) with a 5mm heat-sealer:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Static/Home/ProductCatalog/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GDE40I2KG4TI91816000000_nid=D946WGPBNTbeCHW1NDTH4Zgl
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I believe it was Farmer Bob (I might be wrong) who has suggested that whereas the plastic used in vacuum-sealing is porous (and as evidenced by your test the negative atmospheric pressure differential is not enough to prevent complete diffusion of particles through the plastic membrane), moisture barrier bags lined with metal are a better choice for shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm curious to see if this is true and I'm sure others are as well.

     I was wondering if you'd be able to test metal-laminate bags (as suggested by some posters to be more secure than vacuum-seal plastic) with a 5mm heat-sealer:
     <br/>

     http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Static/Home/ProductCatalog/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GDE40I2KG4TI91816000000_nid=D946WGPBNTbeCHW1NDTH4Zgl
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I believe it was Farmer Bob (I might be wrong) who has suggested that whereas the plastic used in vacuum-sealing is porous (and as evidenced by your test the negative atmospheric pressure differential is not enough to prevent complete diffusion of particles through the plastic membrane), moisture barrier bags lined with metal are a better choice for shipping.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'm curious to see if this is true and I'm sure others are as well.

    I'm with him on this one. Anyway you can test these? I ask because I've ordered from FarmerBob using those bags a couple times.

    i did not scale the packages but the weights were something around 15-20 grams weed, 3-5 grams speed, coke and mdma.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    all packages were in 15 to 25 celcius all the time. interesting point that i did not take into consideration. maybe we will try freezing (air mail) and higher temperatures (land mail) to see what it does.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i can try to get some mylar bags and other interesting looking packaking material for experimenting. after all this is very interesting and lots of fun :D

    one set of bags is in the freezer waiting for sunday. i will take it out 24 hours before the test.

    other bags get  a trip to sauna to see how heat and humidity affects the package. my guess is that the weed will reek like no tomorrow.

    I call bullshit on this.

    Just because we dumbfuck humans can't tell when a smell such as weed is overpowered with alcohol doesn't mean a dog can't. Infact a dog can smell cancer within the human body, which means they can definitely smell your MDMA from 100 layers of "vacuumed wrapping".

    The fact you can get delivery successfully through most postal services and via customs is pure luck. It's a percentages game based on government finances and voter expectations.

     My good friend owns a breeding kennel for one the dogs most used by customs and police for tracking substances, money, people and whatever. Recently he got there a new "stud dog" that was retired from police :). It is specially trained for drug sniffings and served 5 years, busted out many not-so-bright people :P
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So we bought a vacuum machine + some weed, amphetamine, cocaine and mdma. We tried single vacuum, double vacuum and triple vacuum. Each layer was rubbed with alcohol and different gloves were used to pack the stuff in and for other handling. Packaging was done in different premises with different clothing on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If it did not get it at 1st time, we tried several different time spans for same packages to see if they start to leak the smell. All of these "experiments" were done twice to get constant data (Yes, I like Mythbusters!). I will post more results in few days, I still have the same packages we used.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am not sure if I have mentioned my home country in some of my previous messages, propably yes but just in case, it is a place with notorious customs in Scandinavia :).
     <br/>
     Weed:
     <br/>
     1 layer, 15 mins both times
     <br/>
     2 layers, 12 hours 1st, 3 days 2nd
     <br/>
     3 layers: not after 48 hours, but got after 5 days. 2nd was not detected after 5 days.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Amfetamine:
     <br/>
     No reaction at all to any packages in vacuumsafter 5 days. No reaction to speed in plastic bag either. I think it may have something to do with the speed itself, the stuff that is mostly sold here is totally different than the "ducth paste" we used. Our stuff origins from Baltic countries and Russia, they use different precursos and methods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Cocaine:
     <br/>
     After 5 days no reaction to any package. Obviously he still knows it´s coke and a no-no, he found three stashes in plastic bags with no problems.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MDMA:
     <br/>
     Dog went wild on this, I think it was his favourite:
     <br/>
     1 layer: both 15 min
     <br/>
     2 layer: 1st 15min, 2nd 1 hour
     <br/>
     3 layers: 1st not after 5 days, 2nd after 24 hours.

    I agree, dogs can smell molecules so no matter how many times you vacuum seal a single molecule will leak out and the dog will detect it which is why if you ship international you should come up with better packaging methods.

    yes, dogs can smell incredibly small things and i know only one molecule is enough - in theory.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in practice it´s a different thing; they don´t have unlimited time, they are not always near the source of smell, something else might get their attention. this is more about at which point the odours leak so much outside that they can be detected easily.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if the one single molecule would always be enough there would be no lost people, no hidden corpses, no drug smuggling, no crime scene runners, nothing that could be tracked with a dog would be unfound.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    don´t take this too seriously, this is more of a fun test just out of interest to get even some idea if different amount of vacuum layers really matter, rather than a hard-on scientific approach :).

      This is interesting, although i've never heard of HDPP, I assume you meant HDPE? But if its HDPE you can't use HDPE's for hermetic sealing that i'm aware of, and I'd guess HDPP would just be referring to PP. I've seen people suggesting using mylar bags, which would make quite a bit of sense, even in the food communities Mylar is far superior for long term storage.

      [Pine Note: The organization of the study into permeation rates]
      <br/>
      <br/>
      3.4.1. Controlled Odor Mimic Permeation System (COMPS)
      <br/>
      The chemical compounds used as odor mimic were prepared for presentation to canines
      <br/>
      according to the physical appearance of the compounds. Solid compounds were weighed
      <br/>
      to various amounts and heat sealed within a polymer bags. Liquid compounds were
      <br/>
      spiked onto 2in x 2in sterile gauze pads and heat sealed within LDPE bags. The solid
      <br/>
      amounts varied from 5mg to 2g and liquid amounts varied from 1mL to 5mL. The
      <br/>
      polymer bags that were used included 3in x 3in 1.5mil, 2mil, 3mil, 4mil LDPE and 2mil
      <br/>
      HDPP. The COMPS device was then heat sealed and stored within an aluminized Kapak
      <br/>
      bag. Negative controls were created by with blank media (i.e. blank gauze, empty
      <br/>
      polymer bags, and blank tea candles).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      3.4.2. Permeation of Odor Compounds
      <br/>
      Once the COMPS were prepared, they were monitored (weighed) over the course of
      <br/>
      twenty-one days to determine the mass loss per time, i.e. the permeation rate through the
      <br/>
      polymer bags. At the conclusion of the weighing process, the data was plotted as mass vs.
      <br/>
      time. Each sample was made-up in triplicate for statistical purposes. The plotted results
      <br/>
      of average mass loss vs. time in days allowed for a calculation of permeation rate and
      <br/>
      half-life for each odor compounds through the polymer bags. Empty bags were also heat
      <br/>
      sealed and kept in the same environment to use as control samples. These controls
      <br/>
      were made in triplicate blanks were kept and monitored concurrently to maintain
      <br/>
      a baseline.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      [Pine Note: On the two different types of plastic used in the study]
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Polymers:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Polyethylene:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Polyethylene is the most commonly encountered polymer used to date. Among its many
      <br/>
      commercial uses include items such as grocery bags, shampoo bottles, children's toys,
      <br/>
      and even bullet proof vests. The simplest structure of all commercial polymers,
      <br/>
      polyethylene, is comprised of a long chain of carbon atoms with two hydrogen atoms
      <br/>
      attached to each carbon atom (Figure 11). The structure is referred to as a linear
      <br/>
      polyethylene or high-density polyethylene (HDPE).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Figure 11 - Polymer Structures [Pine Note: Look at the jpeg in the document]
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Within this simple structure, variations/mutations can occur. One mutation consists of the
      <br/>
      substitution of additional polyethylene chains in place of the hydrogens (Figure 12).
      <br/>
      Referred to as branching, the substitution occurs in low-density polyethylene (LDPE).
      <br/>
      LDPE has a lower tensile strength and higher ductility than HDPE. While linear
      <br/>
      polyethylene offers a more rigid structure (i.e. it is much stronger), branched
      <br/>
      polyethylene is less expensive and easier to make than linear polyethylene.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Polypropylene:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Polypropylene is a versatile polymer that serves as both a plastic and as a fiber. As a
      <br/>
      plastic it is used to make things such as dishwasher-safe food containers. Polypropylene
      <br/>
      does not melt below 160oC, unlike polyethylene which anneals at 100oC causing dishes to
      <br/>
      warp in a dishwasher. As a fiber, polypropylene is used to make indoor-outdoor
      <br/>
      carpeting. Because it is easy to color and resistant to water, it is often seen around pools
      <br/>
      and miniature-golf courses.

      [Pine Note: How they used the dogs as part of the study.]
      <br/>
      <br/>
      3.4.3. Field Trials
      <br/>
      Field trials were performed with trained and certified local law enforcement explosive
      <br/>
      detection canine teams and drug detection canine teams. The odor aids were presented to
      <br/>
      the canines in metal scent/electrical boxes, Sigma PseudoTM Scent Cages, or quart paint
      <br/>
      cans. Prior to use, the presentation vessels were cleaned with soap, rinsed with water, and
      <br/>
      placed in an oven set to 110ºC for a minimum of 12 hours. After preparation, the odor
      <br/>
      samples were presented to the canines in an “odor line-up” by placing the samples on the
      <br/>
      floor approximately one meter apart (Figure 15). The handlers were instructed to work
      <br/>
      with their detection canines to detail each sample in the line-up utilizing their normal
      <br/>
      search pattern. The handlers had no previous knowledge of the compounds or order of
      <br/>
      placement in the line-up. Additionally, there was no marking on the containers to indicate
      <br/>
      the contents. A positive control and negative control were included in the odor line-ups.
      <br/>
      The positive control was an actual explosive sample provided by the police agency at the
      <br/>
      time of testing. The negative control was an object from the ambient environment used
      <br/>
      for the trial. Forty-three certified drug detection canines and twenty certified explosive detection
      <br/>
      canines participated in this study. Field test attendance varied from three to ten canines at
      <br/>
      any given test. For data collection, analysis, and result reporting purposes, each canine
      <br/>
      was assigned an individual three digit identification code. The code system also groups
      <br/>
      the canine teams into the explosive or drug detection category.

      [Pine Note: Finally the Paragraph that has us excited about HDPP's potential]:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As expected, the permeation rate is affected by the thickness of the LDPE bags (Table
      <br/>
      15). The thinner the polymer bag, the faster the permeation rate (250ng/sec for 1.5mil
      <br/>
      bag); conversely, the thicker the polymer bag, the slower the permeation rate (142ng/sec
      <br/>
      for 4mil bag). The low density form means that there is less organization to the
      <br/>
      polyethylene structure because of branching (see section 2.5). This branching creates
      <br/>
      gaps, and the larger gaps, the easier it is for the compounds to pass through the polymer.
      <br/>
      Thicker polyethylene does not necessarily equate to a more structured form, but it does
      <br/>
      provide a thicker weave of polyethylene branches through which the compound must
      <br/>
      pass. The increased time the compound spends passing though the polymer matrix
      <br/>
      reduces the permeation rate of the compound. Permeation through the HDPP bag was
      <br/>
      substantially lower than the thickest LDPE bags (19ng/sec vs. 142ng/s). The reduction in
      <br/>
      permeation rate can be explained though the nature of a high density polymer and the
      <br/>
      polypropylene structure. The rigidity of the isotactic blocks found in polypropylene
      <br/>
      coupled with the high linearity characteristic of the high density form greatly reduces the
      <br/>
      available openings the compound to pass through resulting in a slower permeation rate.

      What are Polypropylene bags?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Polypropylene poly bags are made from virgin polypropylene plastic. Polypropylene bags are versatile, attractive bags most commonly used for packaging small items such as beads and lollies. These bags can be sealed with a heat sealer like many other plastic bags. While polypropylene is similar to cello, polypropylene bags are much clearer with neater seals, and have the advantage of being less expensive than cello bags.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Polypropylene poly bags have been the choice for product presentation and preserving freshness. Polypropylene poly bags are a high clarity crystal clear bag which enhances the product's image. They provide a highly protective barrier against moisture, dirt and vapors and meet FDA and EFSA specifications for food content. Polypropylene bags also referred as 'Polyprop bags' or 'PP bags'.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      These bags are by far the most popular for give away because of both its price and features. They are mainly used for displays.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      History of Polypropylene
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Professor Giulio Natta produced the first polypropylene resin in Spain in 1954. Natta utilised catalysts developed for the polyethylene industry and applied the technology to propylene gas. Commercial production began in 1957 and polypropylene usage has displayed strong growth from this date. The versatility of the polymer (the ability to adapt to a wide range of fabrication methods and applications) has sustained growth rates enabling PP to challenge the market share of a host of alternative materials in plethora of applications.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      [Pine Note: "plethora of applications" No fucking shit! :D :D :D]
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Properties of Polypropylene
      <br/>
      <br/>
      (Semi-rigid, translucent, good chemical resistance, tough, good fatigue resistance, integral hinge property, good heat resistance).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Production of polypropylene takes place by slurry, solution or gas phase process, in which the propylene monomer is subjected to heat and pressure in the presence of a catalyst system. Polymerisation is achieved at relatively low temperature and pressure and the product yielded is translucent, but readily coloured. Differences in catalyst and production conditions can be used to alter the properties of the plastic.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      PP does not present stress-cracking problems and offers excellent electrical and chemical resistance at higher temperatures. While the properties of PP are similar to those of Polyethylene, there are specific differences. These include a lower density, higher softening point (PP doesn't melt below 160oC, Polyethylene, a more common plastic, will anneal at around 100oC) and higher rigidity and hardness. Additives are applied to all commercially produced polypropylene resins to protect the polymer during processing and to enhance end-use performance.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      [Pine Note: This is interesting too]
      <br/>
      <br/>
      CPP or cast polypropylene film is a multilayer polypropylene film with co-polymer and homo-polymer. It is used as a heat seal layer along with BOPP or polyester film in a laminate for packing of food articles. CPP films have been known in the packaging field to be the more elegant brother of polyethylene film, with higher gloss, greater transparency and better heat resistance.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      [Pine Note:
      <br/>
      I translate that to: certain types of HDPP should be the gold standard for long trips to hot places like Australia. Food Science you are unloved but we think you are the awesomest of all the sciences except maybe chemistry.]

    I think the alcohol would be used to try to remove any molecules left over on the material, if any had come into contact with it, not to "trick" the dogs nose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The difference between "100 layers of vacuumed wrapping" and the human body would be, the vacuum seal would of just been applied. So the smell needs a lot of time to permeate all of the layers. Where as the human body with cancer let's say, has had cancer for a week. I'm not sure on how the human body compares to 100 layers of vacuum seal, but i'm going to say that within a week, the smell would of permeated both depending on how porus they are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as i'm aware dogs don't have some magical power to be able to smell any molecule through materials that haven't had time to permeate.

     Just because we dumbfuck humans can't tell when a smell such as weed is overpowered with alcohol doesn't mean a dog can't. Infact a dog can smell cancer within the human body, which means they can definitely smell your MDMA from 100 layers of "vacuumed wrapping".

      My good friend owns a breeding kennel for one the dogs most used by customs and police for tracking substances, money, people and whatever. Recently he got there a new "stud dog" that was retired from police :). It is specially trained for drug sniffings and served 5 years, busted out many not-so-bright people :P
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So we bought a vacuum machine + some weed, amphetamine, cocaine and mdma. We tried single vacuum, double vacuum and triple vacuum. Each layer was rubbed with alcohol and different gloves were used to pack the stuff in and for other handling. Packaging was done in different premises with different clothing on.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If it did not get it at 1st time, we tried several different time spans for same packages to see if they start to leak the smell. All of these "experiments" were done twice to get constant data (Yes, I like Mythbusters!). I will post more results in few days, I still have the same packages we used.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I am not sure if I have mentioned my home country in some of my previous messages, propably yes but just in case, it is a place with notorious customs in Scandinavia :).
      <br/>
      Weed:
      <br/>
      1 layer, 15 mins both times
      <br/>
      2 layers, 12 hours 1st, 3 days 2nd
      <br/>
      3 layers: not after 48 hours, but got after 5 days. 2nd was not detected after 5 days.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Amfetamine:
      <br/>
      No reaction at all to any packages in vacuumsafter 5 days. No reaction to speed in plastic bag either. I think it may have something to do with the speed itself, the stuff that is mostly sold here is totally different than the "ducth paste" we used. Our stuff origins from Baltic countries and Russia, they use different precursos and methods.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Cocaine:
      <br/>
      After 5 days no reaction to any package. Obviously he still knows it´s coke and a no-no, he found three stashes in plastic bags with no problems.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      MDMA:
      <br/>
      Dog went wild on this, I think it was his favourite:
      <br/>
      1 layer: both 15 min
      <br/>
      2 layer: 1st 15min, 2nd 1 hour
      <br/>
      3 layers: 1st not after 5 days, 2nd after 24 hours.

    From what my buddies have told me that work at UPS,USPS, and FedEx is that they tend to use older dogs that have experience but their weakness is the amount of packages they have to go through several packages and tend to only spot the packages that aren't even sealed either properly or at all which is why the success rate, according to pine, is over 95%. I still wouldn't leave it up to chance though and continue researching on how to improve your packaging, I see a lot vendors just seal once and get comfortable.

    Thanks to thisaintme for setting up the experiments. We need a more rigorous scientific approach to add to the body of vendor knowledge. Even though we might not have a clean room laboratory or something, it still behooves us to think and run empirical experiments to discover new heuristics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course producing superior packaging may seem a little irrelevant given the statistics I myself I have collected before. The DSR was 97.51% in the last poll, and data from a more recent thread is 95.07% (but sample was smaller).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, this would be a short sighted mistake, because odds are that the government will be sponsoring more elaborate security apparatus in the future. This is after all an arms race.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thus eventually the men will be separated from the boys, so you had better be ready when it comes. Because then there will be über-profits for all the sharpest vendors. I'll explain why.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This evolution will most likely at the level of International Shipping because the package numbers are smaller than Domestic. Thing is of course is that the smart vendors have already long figured out that the profit margins on geographical arbitrage are much higher than D2D. I mean, you can obtain your normal margin + at something like 25% - 100% on the entire deal by transshipping up from some southern states (e.g. cocaine) to ones like New York, or (e.g. marijuana) shipping from British Columbia to the south, another veritable silk road. But! You could just as easily be shipping to countries like Norway, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia. For example; even a naive vendor pair with no previous connects can buy e.g. cocaine @ 80USD/g in the southern U.S and then have the other fellow in New Zealand who will be able to retail it at a minimum of 300USD/g. I've actually heard it's twice as high as that, but I'm being conservative here. Similarly, there is huge demand for real MDMA (because in truth they've never had the real thing in some parts), you can acquire at 2-4USD per pill and retail at 30-40USD per pill in Australia and New Zealand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about that. Take the average at both geographical locations and calculate. That's a &gt; 1000% profit for the pair of you! Of course shipping also takes longer, so let's not get too excited, but even so, I think you should be cheering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An outraged Hoffa can confirm prices, I think he'll broadly agree wherever he happens to live.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    --
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, my point is that this is the most difficult route due to interceptions, due to a mixture of circumstances e.g. the voluminous Australian border watch propaganda deterring low I.Q local dealers unable to see it for what it is (a giant bluff, but it still gives less 'cannon fodder' cover for ourselves), the longer than normal journey + temperature, the concentration of mail etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whenever LE try to come up with a killer app or some combination of strategies, it's most likely going to be on "silk roads" like this one. This will mean those people using HDPP packaging + an unnatural number of layers will win hands down and everybody else is screwed. This surely implies the existing level of arbitrage will massively increase. HDPP plastic emits 1215.78% less particulate than normal LDPE plastic, especially under conditions of heat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What happens, when you're already making 1000% profit, and then your competition (mostly those not using vaccum packing actually, it's not really SR vendors you're competing with) gets whacked by losing 10 times more packages?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use HDPP plastic and enjoy Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage.
    <br/>

    I knew I studied that Economics book all those years ago for some fucking reason.

    Anyway, thisaintme keep up the good work with your excellent resources. I think I asked novacaine to be vacuum packing fried bacon to see if his bacon obsessed dog would detect the contents, but a trained MDMA loving police dog is still better yet.

    P.S. FarmerBob, I think disagrees with the idea that HDPP is a pancrea. We should quiz him on why! :)

    Pine, I've read all your posts and theres a few things I'm hoping you might be able to help me clear up (in layman's terms). It seem that HDPP packaging is the best for international deliveries and staying one ahead, but everywhere I've looked online, the bags just look like the woven bags that sand is carried in?

    I'm also confused about mylar (moisture barrier)/vacuum, are these both considered to be LDPP?

    To shed some light on this: Once you buy "paste" it means that in 99.9% of the cases it is cut. This is done by dissolving amphetamine in a liquid, adding all kinds of adulterants and letting it partly dry, resulting in this paste-ish consistency. As liquid a lot of solvents can be used, different alcohols, aceton, etc. Therefore it is hard to train a dog to find this. Pure amphetamine(sulphate) is odorless and very hard to detect.

    Ex-girl friend was a vet, she said police dogs are all crazy because of the drill and they can be trained to find pretty much any smell. For them it's as obvious as a red shiny stone in a bucket of water for us humans.

    There are special resealable bags made for camping that are designed to stop bears and shit from smelling your food. If properly handled and layered, they will stop dogs from smelling anything for at least 5 days. Hungry bears (who have a far better sense of smell than any dog) usually cannot smell food you place in these bags even after several days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've heard of someone who tested these and similar bags using hunting dogs and animal carcasses. The dogs failed to locate the dead animals even after several days of decay. Furthermore, someone I know had a personal encounter with a drug dog while concealing a small amount of bud within 2 layers of these (properly handled) resealable camping bags. Dog didn't smell shit. The weed was only in there for about one day, but it's still impressive given the convenience of these easy to use bags. I'm not sure what they are made from and that info is likely proprietary anyway. However, it did say that the material is 17,000x stronger than HDPE as far as odor protection goes.

    We must be looking at different things. Some HDPP (there's probably a few phenotypes) looks a lot like the plastic bags those expensive boiled sweets or specialist chocolates/truffles come in (this is of course pure hearsay, pine wouldn't know anything about expensive choc truffles...). It is slightly more rigid and crinkly (is that a real word?).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HDPP seems to be a family of plastic types depending on the application, like the way LDPE is. It will be important to select the correct HDPP type, not just any particular type, and you may choose different types of HDPP for different reasons. I think I highlighted one type used in the food industry which doubles up as a sort of heat shield barrier for example.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know all the facts, because like yourself I'm learning on the job, but more research must surely be done into HDPP if we can expect a 10 fold decrease in interceptions (from detections). Although HDPP could be a comparative advantage that eventually gives HDPP vacuum packing vendors a decisive edge over the competition, that is more of a hypothetical in comparison to the guarantee that less packages are intercepted because it lowers the vendors overall risk of getting busted. So, even if the pay off is the same, the lower risk still makes it worthwhile (and apparently it is even cheaper than LDPE, woot!)

    On the other question, I am no mylar expert, but mylar is a polyethylene (PE vs PP) so in theory according to the whitepaper it ought to have higher levels of particulate transmission. I have a thought that Farmer Bob will disagree with that, so let's wait and see what he says.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ideally, we should experiment with LDPE vs HDPP vs BoPET (mylar is a brand name if you like) and any other ideas of appropriate plastic to test ourselves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Instead of waiting for days on end to conduct our experiments, we could simply arrange the conditions that the package would suffer. i.e. being moved about + higher temperatures over a period of time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The best way of doing this is simple I think. Just sterilize your tumble dryer somehow and then throw a package in there to test it. We cannot all obtain police dogs, but it may be possible to obtain portable drug detection equipment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean, if we have a package that's been in a tumble dryer for 2 hours at high heat (I've had pillows melt on me with these conditions!), and it still emits single digit nanograms per second of particulate, then I would feel very safe using that method to send product through the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other issue is the pin test. You'll notice threads in shipping from before where the packages have arrived with holes in them. This is sometimes because Customs/Postal inspectors put a pin through a package and then give it to a dog to sniff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This can be easily defeated by using lunchboxes which use rigid plastic all the way around if you're shifting larger quantities of product (but I recommend most vendors ship under an ounce and swarm packages across instead).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm a bit leery of using metallic mylar, not for any evidence based reason, I just wonder if it would become a red flag on an x-ray (not for any good reason, but because some idiots think xrays can't see through alum foil (that could be true of radio waves though if you were building a Faraday cage)).

    Mylar is sometimes used to contain samples to be X-ray'd. They wouldn't use it if it attenuated or deflected the beam. However, I'm not sure if it will show up differently on actual package scanners that use X-rays. I guess you could always use resealed potato chip bags or something with a custom label related to food.

    Yeah, but who posts potato chips through the mail from America or Europe to intentional destinations like Australia? Probably less people than those sending drugs! (when you look at all the RC seiziures Customs makes for example).
    <br/>

    Tell me more about these bear bag/container things. That's an interesting idea!  Do you have any intel on the composition? Most bear proof stuff I'm seeing is not about preventing bears knowing food exists, but preventing them getting at it (cruelty to animals!).

    I wouldn't use that to ship to AUS but hey, if you have a bunch of techniques in your rotation it won't hurt to switch it up. Using actual resealed potato chip bags is easy but doesn't look right. It would be best to make your own Mylar bags with custom labels if you want to go that route.

    Not sure what they were made of, but it's probably some proprietary material or blend. They definitely keep bears from smelling the food though. Those other bear bags are designed to let them chew without breaking the bag.

    Pine, I've found this; http://www.alphap.com/basics/compare.html
    <br/>
    Shows different moisture vapour transmission rates of various plastics. HDPE and PP come out the same for MVTR, although they have a much greater O2 and CO2 transmission rate than PET. Now I am wondering what the significance of this is, since the dogs are not sniffing for pure O2 and CO2?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone here specifically know how the MDMA odors are transmitted? If MDMA molecules are bound to water vapour then surely a material with the lowest possible MVTR will be best. If not, is anyone aware of a standard specification for odor transmission?

    well good job thisaintme.

    try putting the bags in an envelope or box and sticking them in a hot car for a day or two.  That will be the real test as high temperatures will greatly increase diffusion rates.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vacuuming should make no difference, in fact on polymer bags pulling a vacuum should make the results slightly worse.  Stresses that cause any inelastic deformation or stretching of any type of polymer will reduce the crystallinity of that polymer.  Reduced crystallinity WILL cause greater permeation.  I know it seems counter-intuitive, but diffusion flows are largely independent of absolute pressure.  If you don't trust me (and why should you) then go to wikipedia and get to know the diffusion equation, if you can handle calculus you can handle diff-eq.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason I do not use PP, PE or any other homogeneous polymer is that COTS flexible polymer films tend to have a wide range of crystallinity and there's no guarantee that the PP one guy has is the same as the PP from another vendor.  This stuff is generally made for food and so there's no quality control on many of the factors that impact scent permeation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Moisture barrier bags are designed to limit flows of moisture and gasses.  They'll do a great job of containing heavier organics, better than any polymer bags will.  The ones i use are 7-mil thick but are roughly equivalent in moisture permeation to the 3-inch thick acrylic you see in bulletproof windows at gas stations.  The 3M COTS bags (the -2700s I think) are probably close to that in performance as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    dual beam x-ray systems cannot spot aluminum that thin.  Thick metals, particularly dense metals, show up very well, but 1-mil of a light metal like aluminum is less absorptive of the x-rays than the 6-mils of plastic.  there's no way a dual beam system will discern that as a metal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bear proof bags are just 3M MBBs with a zip-line on them and then re-sold at an outrageous price.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mylar is not the same as a MBB.  Mylar is probably better than a straight polymer bag but it's not the engineered material that a real MBB is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if people want to use polymer bags more power to them, I'm not a buyer here, only a seller, so there's no risk to me.  And I've decided that every herd needs some slow movers to feed the lions.  Otherwise the lions would have to up their game.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once again good job thisaintme

    and thanks Pine for the heads up, I probably would have never found this otherwise.

     Moisture barrier bags are designed to limit flows of moisture and gasses.  They'll do a great job of containing heavier organics, better than any polymer bags will.  The ones i use are 7-mil thick but are roughly equivalent in moisture permeation to the 3-inch thick acrylic you see in bulletproof windows at gas stations.  The 3M COTS bags (the -2700s I think) are probably close to that in performance as well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     dual beam x-ray systems cannot spot aluminum that thin.  Thick metals, particularly dense metals, show up very well, but 1-mil of a light metal like aluminum is less absorptive of the x-rays than the 6-mils of plastic.  there's no way a dual beam system will discern that as a metal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bear proof bags are just 3M MBBs with a zip-line on them and then re-sold at an outrageous price.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Mylar is not the same as a MBB.  Mylar is probably better than a straight polymer bag but it's not the engineered material that a real MBB is.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, if people want to use polymer bags more power to them, I'm not a buyer here, only a seller, so there's no risk to me.  And I've decided that every herd needs some slow movers to feed the lions.  Otherwise the lions would have to up their game.

    It's a better idea if we keep our suppliers to ourselves, and simply mention what you specifically need to obtain. Then finding the suppliers is trivial. Otherwise you could be creating the birth of a source of intelligence for LEO, perhaps not now, but if enough vendors buy product X from supplier Y...

    Sick info OP thanks, and Pine also, this really gives us a better idea of just how 'safe' our packages are whether in transit or sitting at a drop somewhere. Gives some ideas too what kind of things to use as outer materials to stash things in places like cars or buildings.

    You're making a good effort, but we need to be doing experiments far more scientifically, I mean there is simply no comparison between a canine nose and a human one. If smelling was seeing, then we would be the equivalent of cave bats in the kingdom of the mammals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, getting the raw data, getting numbers is super important so you have a solid foundation. It is clear from the academic whitepapers that multiple layers are good if handled correctly in a clean staging area, taking the particulate rate (our key metric) of nanograms to hundreds per sec. However although this massively deters both electronic and canine noses in terms of the practical business of prioritization when faced with many packages such as at the postal conveyor belts in sorting offices, you ideally want the PR at single digit ng/sec so that even an experienced dog or the best electronic detection equipment fails when presented directly with a package to alert on. So, we need access to equipment for testing (to produce some blackpapers, ha ha I'm so funny... don't give up your Int smuggling career just yet pine!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the meantime, upping your layers to 3, ensuring your staging area practices are clean and possibly putting packages into ice water before transmission sound to me like reasonable precautions. Good job on the acetone wipe btw, more people should be doing that.
    <br/>

    Yes our pals at OVDB are fond of using mason jars because it prohibits the Customs pin test from working and they may have a requirement to be distributing vials of liquid LSD occasionally. However two issues are that glass is infamously not so opaque, and more importantly the transmission of glass receptacles through the postal system (IMHO of course) is subject to breakages and also can suggest the carriage of a liquid (or allow such an interpretation to be chosen if you understand me), which is a red flag to a postal service constantly on the look out for mail bombs. Maybe it was different pre 9/11, but that's changed, I would hare hundred miles away from giving the postal inspectors any hint of explosives traversing the mail system, because then they would have much greater leverage to open anything they want. USPS affords drugs in the mail some degree of protection due to legal rules that don't apply to private couriers. USPS folding, which it almost certainly will, will introduce problems for unsophisticated drug smugglers later on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is normal for small quantities of drugs of all kinds to (most illicit packages picked up are probably initially imagined to be steroids or foreign RCs) travel through the postal system. A couple of grams of MDMA vacuum packed a couple of times with LDPE or HDPP or Mylar, and splitting larger quantities above 10 grams into multiple packages is probably the optimal choice in today's present environment (suggest using a little plastic container inside the layers so it's not messy, or possibly a foil sachet like the sort that comes with your quick cook noodles).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In all honestly, I think proper staging area handling is more of a problem right now than the packaging technique (but if you don't use packaging then you don't have a problem, you are the problem lol). Judging from what SR's informants say inside the postal system, often dogs will practically attack a package, tear it to shreds while completely ignoring the drugs vacuum packed that fell out of the exterior package. Clearly the vendor screwed up with his handling policy. Either his staging area was not clean or he touched the exterior/interior of the vacuum packaging with drug particulate on his paws. Or god forbid he went off and smoked a joint to relieve stress.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As such, it might behoove people to be closely examining the strict staging area protocols observed by those scientists that work in cleanroom laboratories in the nanotech and biomed industry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember above all else, this is only half about avoiding interceptions of product, it is also about decreasing risks for the vendor, that is arguably far more important than merely losing business.

    Oh certainly... I'm not sending stuff through the mails so much, so its not a concern. I just rarely stash anything @ home so having a "person proof" smell barrier is important to me. I found there was little difference between 2 and 3 layers (frankly there was little difference between 1 and 2, but on the thought that the seal on 1 bag could possible fail adding a 2nd layer sounded like a good idea... It would be interesting to test methods out against a trained canine. If I was doing this for a living I sure would be trying to get empirical data...

    Not to mention fingerprints and DNA transfer... I'd suggest doubling up on gloves and tossing the first pair after handling the goods as a bare minimum. Plus some kind of wash of the initial package before stuffing it in an envelope...

    Vacuum sealing is important and of course it creates a window of time in which the contents can not be smelled. You wash with alcohol or similar to clean any traces off the layers of the vacuum bag. A vacuum seal holds molecules in, so it keeps them away from the dogs nose. Over time scent can permeate the vacuum seal bag. Some vacuum seal bags are made with less porous materials than others and thus hold the scent away from the dog longer. I would be hesitant about using metal foil in packages, but would look into less porous plastic bags.

      I agree, dogs can smell molecules so no matter how many times you vacuum seal a single molecule will leak out and the dog will detect it which is why if you ship international you should come up with better packaging methods.

     Vacuum sealing is important and of course it creates a window of time in which the contents can not be smelled. You wash with alcohol or similar to clean any traces off the layers of the vacuum bag. A vacuum seal holds molecules in, so it keeps them away from the dogs nose. Over time scent can permeate the vacuum seal bag. Some vacuum seal bags are made with less porous materials than others and thus hold the scent away from the dog longer. I would be hesitant about using metal foil in packages, but would look into less porous plastic bags.

    Metal foil layer is incredible small with MBBs. 5-10 mil.

    Quit mucking around with vacuum sealing and plastic bags. Go to aluminum foil heavy duty and be done with it. The only place odor is going to escape is from the seams. Fold the foil over until you have one line of seams then seal it with aluminum roofing tape. It is still theoretically possible to get past the adhesive on the tape and there could be a tiny hole in the foil you didn't see. So double bag it, foil is cheap. I trust  metal more than any plastic plus its dirt cheap and can be found anywhere.

    The trick is to make the package look legit when scanned, heat seal foil gives a visual barrier but the scanner sees through it. If sending weed for instance you shouldn't label it as computer chips because that would be obvious on the scanner, but disguising it as dried herbs would be consistent with the scanner results.

    Aluminum foil does not look suspicious on xray though they do not use xray on usa shipments unless they have a warrant. Al foil looks no different than plastic on xray.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You don't put a label on the shiny foil you just sealed up, obviously. You put it inside a padded mailer or a box and send it that way same as you would if you sealed it in plastic. The postal workers see a normal looking box or mailer and do not see the foil inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vacuum sealing does not keep odors in any better than sealing without a vacuum. It does not seem logical but odor can get through with or without vacuum and the vacuum stresses the plastic possibly causing it to crack so vacuum sealing may be worse than sealing without a vacuum and no where near as good as using foil. Or you could use both, foil and plastic. But then put it in something before you mail it.

    I bought a bunch of those bags a couple of months ago. I have been sending some smelly goodies to my friend at university biweekly for almost 4 months with no problems. The bags I ordered are extremely non-porous and they are heat sealed. I had one bag with 2 oz sealed. I left it for 2 weeks in my house and there was absolutely no scent detectable. Idk if dogs would be able to detect it, but the human nose surely couldn't.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: I triple wrap my goodies so that also helps not being detected. The bag I tested was just a single heat sealed bag.

    That's as good as it gets for avoiding canine detection, good on you for taking the time and putting in the effort. I wonder how many other vendors do that?? not many if any at all I bet, I think a lot of people put false hope in the benefits of vacuum sealing, unless it's done in a manner similar to as you describe it doesn't do jack shit to prevent a dog picking up the odor.

    yea, it seems like plastic vacuum bags are the new coffee and fabric softener. i think it is pretty much a forgone conclusion that heat sealed foil bags are tops at the moment, right?? although, for heavy domestic packages, i do love the ghetto version - heavy duty with alum roofing tape over single seal (nice one sunnyd... way to be ms. janx!!). even still, i do like pine's approach that having several ways is really the only way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i've also heard that inside a wax candle works perfectly, anyone get that too?? then again, i used to coat my large orders with a thick layer of vasoline back in the day. my friends would say that opening one of my packages was like delivering a baby...which explains why i take the form of a stork during peyote trips.

    Glad this got bumped.  It is very informative and I hope vendors who may be getting a bit complacent read this and step it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its a bit unsettling how good the dog was at smelling the mdma...It could be sitting in that pack for 2 weeks in some cases longer before a dog walks by it.

    I hope my vendors of choice read Pine's posts.

    I'm going with....."it's doubtful".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I didn't know vac-sealing was that permeable, then the vast majority of vendors sure don't.  Heck, "good stealth" constitutes vac sealing a baggie and sticking it in an envelope with a printed label!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there a list of the types of heat-sealable bags and their permeability?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm also guessing that if detectable amounts take say 3 days to leech in Bag X, then adding another layer means 6 days, then another 9 - or is there more 'diminishing returns' than that?

    For anyone who doesn't get the sarcasm in his statement, "stealth," as far as I'm concerned, means it could *literally* fall out at a postal inspector's feet and without a warrant or a dog, they'd just pick it back up and send it on its way.  People shouldn't throw words like "stealth" around lightly...

    I've pulled vac-sealed drugs out of a package and could smell it with my own nose, so dogs could definitely smell it. That's the problem with 4-5 day shipping times. By the time the package is on the last leg of its journey, most vac-seal jobs have been rendered useless.

    Sooo... It would be interesting to hear from some vendors who have taken action on some of this to improve their shipping techniques. What have you used &amp; have you noticed any improvement with international deliveries? Does adding so many vacuum sealed layers improve shipping rates, seems that extra packaging makes things bulkier &amp; even triple sealed will leak smell after 5 days anyway.

       What do you need to know?
       <br/>
       It's easy to use, the only equipment you need is a pair of hair straighteners or a clothing iron :)

       <br/>
       Make pouches any size you like, no need to vac seal so bud doesn't get crushed as much.
       <br/>
       Basically it is a stronger version of the mylar bags, but in sheet form :)

    I use the foil with my products - and I've never had a problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really like them - and a tip for ST, one day if you've got time just sit around cutting loads of them, that's what I did.. and then all you need to do is seal them (literally takes 2/3 seconds) which is quicker than actually vac sealing the product.

    Great thread OP!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just some thoughts:
    <br/>
    So, the dog went off on some chemicals more than others. It may be true that sniffer dogs will generally follow the pattern of that dog. I wonder, tho, if dogs get different training and may react differently.
    <br/>
    Also, freshly made chemical drugs might be offgassing solvents or whatever and so older well aerated chemical drugs might be less detectible than fresh or ones that were impermiably packaged in storage (since they were fresh). I don't think the dogs will ignore a package because the offgassing solvents "mask" the drug scent.

     well good job thisaintme.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     try putting the bags in an envelope or box and sticking them in a hot car for a day or two.  That will be the real test as high temperatures will greatly increase diffusion rates.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Vacuuming should make no difference, in fact on polymer bags pulling a vacuum should make the results slightly worse.  Stresses that cause any inelastic deformation or stretching of any type of polymer will reduce the crystallinity of that polymer.  Reduced crystallinity WILL cause greater permeation.  I know it seems counter-intuitive, but diffusion flows are largely independent of absolute pressure.  If you don't trust me (and why should you) then go to wikipedia and get to know the diffusion equation, if you can handle calculus you can handle diff-eq.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The reason I do not use PP, PE or any other homogeneous polymer is that COTS flexible polymer films tend to have a wide range of crystallinity and there's no guarantee that the PP one guy has is the same as the PP from another vendor.  This stuff is generally made for food and so there's no quality control on many of the factors that impact scent permeation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Moisture barrier bags are designed to limit flows of moisture and gasses.  They'll do a great job of containing heavier organics, better than any polymer bags will.  The ones i use are 7-mil thick but are roughly equivalent in moisture permeation to the 3-inch thick acrylic you see in bulletproof windows at gas stations.  The 3M COTS bags (the -2700s I think) are probably close to that in performance as well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     dual beam x-ray systems cannot spot aluminum that thin.  Thick metals, particularly dense metals, show up very well, but 1-mil of a light metal like aluminum is less absorptive of the x-rays than the 6-mils of plastic.  there's no way a dual beam system will discern that as a metal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bear proof bags are just 3M MBBs with a zip-line on them and then re-sold at an outrageous price.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Mylar is not the same as a MBB.  Mylar is probably better than a straight polymer bag but it's not the engineered material that a real MBB is.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, if people want to use polymer bags more power to them, I'm not a buyer here, only a seller, so there's no risk to me.  And I've decided that every herd needs some slow movers to feed the lions.  Otherwise the lions would have to up their game.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Once again good job thisaintme
     <br/>
     and thanks Pine for the heads up, I probably would have never found this otherwise.
     <br/>

    I know it's in good faith what all this info is for but the same way you found it and spoke about it anyone can as anyone can make an account on here this stuff should never be revealed out in the open like this as is like I said I know it's in good faith what the OP done but what it stemmed into was a LE info fest honestly think about it and to me if I was a vendor growing and selling green knowing my stuff stinks to high heaven I think I'd have the common sense to test n trial all sorts of materials myself to keep the loud smell in anyway I'm not having a go at anyone cos I know it's all in good faith but you never really know do you ?????? I've always been told think before you speak I don't know how the saying goes for writing things down that anyone can read do you get my drift now without me being a bad guy peace n love people SR for ever DPR is a boss

      What about a water seal or putting the drugs in a air tight baggie then 3 vac sealed plastic bags then inside a glass jar filled with water then inside a foam box (for protecting the glass) then in the bubble bag supplied by the post office .? The glass and water would make it heavy so instead of glass jar put inside a strong rubber bladder with water inside the bladder and have drugs inside that . Just an idea yeah . :-X

     This guy has a serious attitude problem. Vendors beware. Do not sell to this guy. It will not be worth the agro!

    Anyone know whether dogs can detect Methylone? I'm thinking they wouldn't be trained to specifically target Methylone however with a similar chemical structure to MDMA it could have some of the same smells that are detected?

    Subbing to this very good thread :)

    Do you guys think that dogs are our number one enemy? I believe that if a package fools the dogs, all should be fine and dandy, I really dont think the customs have nearly enough resources to go through the thousands of letters moving in and out every day. So if a dog can't smell it, and it looks pretty much like the rest of the mail I should be feeling fairly safe even ordering semi bulk?

    I'm talking about international, inside EU.

    Lol, awesome info, I really only read like 3 pages in so I dont know if anyone has said this, but If your really freaked out by dogs super noses that can "sniff a single molecule out of the air" apparently, lol just dust the inside of your package with benzocaine, it is not illegal and will knockout a dogs smell sensors for at least an hour or two. Simple fucking shit, quadruple/quintuple seal that shit with the Polypropolene bags, then dust that shit in benzocaine dawggg. Lol sounds simple, but dogs are simple creatures that just happen to have good noses, this aint some crazy star wars shit lol you can trick an organism in many different ways. Lol I know you can knockout a dogs sensors with cocaine, but ummmmmm probably better use benzocaine, or ketamine, drug dogs cant smell ketamine I do believe, but I would still go with the benzocaine =p
