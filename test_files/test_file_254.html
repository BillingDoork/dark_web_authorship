    Ive heard an often repeated rumor in the uk that the sniffer dogs used at festivals/gigs/raves etc are usually not actually trained sniffer dogs and are simply there to make people throw there drugs into the honesty box because of the cost in training sniffer dogs etc. Is there any validity to this? it makes sense to me but was wondering

    I don't know about the UK. But in Australia the dogs definitely do sniff out drugs.
    <br/>
    Seen it many,  many times.
    <br/>
    They cause more harm than good though, because I have often seen people panic when they see the drug dog, and then consume 6 pills in one hit to avoid getting caught.
    <br/>
    Then an hour later they are rolling so hard they need medical attention.

    The dogs I used to encounter at UK events never did fuck all apart from look cute, in AU though that's another matter all together, they are bang onto it!! I'm certainly not saying the dogs at UK events aren't the real deal though, this was quite a few years ago in my experience, I certainly wouldn't be taking any chances.

    They only catch &lt;1% of drug users at festivals. It's just a few unlucky people who get caught.
    <br/>
    I've never been to a festival and not been offered or asked for drugs. People eat pills / snort stuff in public too... IMO that's risky though

    They always say the dog has indicated you may have drugs on your peson, just for an excuse to have a feel. Dogs are often just a prop.

    Yep. They target users and dealers. Mainly users though. In Australia, cops have this attitude that every drug seized and not consumed is a life saved. They think they are heroes.
    <br/>
    Sniffer dogs everywhere and shitloads of undercover cops. They walk around all day saying "pills" hoping someone will sell to them, but it's pretty obvious they are a cop. Lol.
    <br/>
    Even at nightclubs they have undercover cops asking for drugs. And when you say no, they hassle you, nearly begging at times. Gets annoying when it happens frequently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And everyone gets padded down and people get their pockets searched randomly upon entry to festivals. Drugs down your pants seems to be a win though. They can't stop that!

    The festivals I go to they ask to see your drugs. I've shown them a QP of weed, about a half ounce of mdma, 50+ tabs and vials of this and that for a group of 6 people and that was totally acceptable. They're more concerned with people bringing in 500 dirty e pills.

    Definitely true that dogs are used as props in some cases in the UK from personal experience, a night every couple of months comes to mind that is literally known for everyone being pretty fucked up there off something/everything, yet when queuing watched not a single bark escape from that dogs lips! Depends on the nights but some organisers know that the majority of people there will be on something so put in lax checks for the formalities and to appease officials if you will. Seen people and have walked by dogs lots of times and so far unscathed... still exercise caution though obviously!

    In Australia, everyone still uses drugs, they just put them down their pants or bra, because they can't do anything to find that. Or some people see sniffer dogs, panic and consume 12 hours worth of drugs in one go. Seen it countless times. And an hour later they are in the medical tent. They are also allowed to strip search is they have "reasonable suspicion" that someone has drugs in their pants or concealed inside of them. IMO that's a massive breach of privacy and rights. I haven't heard of that happening to anyone at a festival though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think they should just let people take what they want in in the name of harm reduction.

    As much as I love Australia it's attitude and approach to drugs is utter bullshit, police attitudes are equally as fucked and their heavy handed approach to policing of festivals is enough to put you off going.

    Not sure if that's going to change anytime soon either especially with a general election not far off, the libs love to tub thump their tough on crime bullshit, yawn.

    speaking from personal experience here, I normally would use those chemistry / kitchen disposable gloves to gladwrap whatever I'm bringing in, at least a couple of layers then inserting them in condoms (2 layers) then leave it for a couple days. On the day of the festival I'd then put on the gloves and wrap it in another layer of condom. I'd then go for a shower to remove any possible traces of powder etc and also fresh change of clothes, then down the jock it goes. quite lengthy but yeah I don't wanna risk getting caught or having the nervousness that comes with walking past these damn dogs.

    Sniffer dogs at festivals are a terrible idea. Festival security and organizers need the punters to be loved up on drugs!!!

    There would be way too many fights/agro if everyone was just drinking alcohol!

    DON'T leave it for a couple of days. Time is the enemy. Permeation takes time. (Heat - the crotch being a generally warm area... unless you wanna icepack it... will speed permeation more.)
    <br/>
    Wrap as soon as you can before you go. Think about this. Would you want to wrap an open can of tuna in a couple condoms and gloves for a few days and then see if a dog could smell it? No? Then don't do that with drugs.
    <br/>
    Latex/nitrile will not do much to slow scent.  (Although totally take condoms with you, that's good thinking.) Use plastic ziploc baggie inside a moisture barrier bag. As soon as possible prior to departure, this should be heat sealed, wash it down with hot soapy water (which will show you air leaks when you immerse it; the plastic bag is just in case you fuck up the seal, and for convenience later), trim the sharp edges that could cause you ouchies, and then nestle that up in your junk... but don't snuggle up to it until right before you have to. Keep it cool/cold as long as you can.
    <br/>
    Moisture barrier bags are readily available. You'll notice that, perhaps, your coffee comes in one. Or your small electronic parts. A clever lad could experiment with heat sealing that with an iron, or maybe even a  hair flat-iron (marginal.)  It's not perfect for shipping if you don't know its spec, but it'll probably get your groin-stealth past the Malinois.

    I'm tired of seeing people who overdose in a panic when they encounter the dogs or see the dogs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sniffer dogs at festivals/events arguably increase risk, lull parents into a false sense of security, and increase impulsive poisonings due to the sense of pressure.
    <br/>
    Use the dogs for weapons or explosives if needed.

      Are you serious? What amazing part of the world is this? I think I will move there immediately.

      Is this cops you're talking about? If a cop spotted a pill here, you'd be immediately arrested. 5 pills can get you done for dealing which is absolutely fucked.
      <br/>
      In Australia, everyone still uses drugs, they just put them down their pants or bra, because they can't do anything to find that. Or some people see sniffer dogs, panic and consume 12 hours worth of drugs in one go. Seen it countless times. And an hour later they are in the medical tent. They are also allowed to strip search is they have "reasonable suspicion" that someone has drugs in their pants or concealed inside of them. IMO that's a massive breach of privacy and rights. I haven't heard of that happening to anyone at a festival though.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I think they should just let people take what they want in in the name of harm reduction.

     As much as I love Australia it's attitude and approach to drugs is utter bullshit, police attitudes are equally as fucked and their heavy handed approach to policing of festivals is enough to put you off going.

    I totally agree with you. At the moment, there is this attitude and belief that drugs are bad and anyone who uses them are stupid and therefore deserve to die if they use drugs.
    <br/>
    When I was younger, I was taught that drugs were bad and never use drugs. Then as I grew older, I realised a huge proportion of people use drugs and most of them aren't addicted and there are very few problems with their health, overdosing, etc. I suppose some people just fail to open their minds from what the Government would have you believe. The Government is not always right and they are taking a wrong approach to drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure, drugs aren't healthy, but neither is tobacco, alcohol, junk food, and the list goes on. Junk food and unhealthy eating habits has caused much more health problems than all drugs combined. Over 50% of Australian's are now overweight or obese, which is insane if you think about it. However, nearly all drug users that I know are in much better shape than the people I know who don't use drugs. There should be pill testing centres in nightlife areas and at music festivals. There should be no drug dogs and there should be alot of education about drugs, rather than the "just say no" attitude. I believe that if these actions were taken, there would be far less problems with drugs than there is now, even though the rate is very low as it is). I know many people who take pills without even having the slightest idea what it is. All they know is that it's a pill and they have no idea what is in it and what is was sold as. Alot of drug users also don't know they should drink water and they don't know the side effects of the drug or what to expect.

    I know. It is very unfair. Stereosonic probably has less fights than Melbourne cup anyway cause everyone is on MDMA, not alcohol or cocaine.
    <br/>
    They only target young people because older people love to hear about younger people getting arrested for drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I actually didn't see any dogs at stereosonic Brisbane this year. But there were LOADS of undercover cops making the rounds asking everyone if they have pills for sale. And they persist with it too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I love how there was no line for the piss trough but the queue to get into a cubicle was 15 mins long so everyone can take their drugs. Lol

     K9s do fatigue pretty fast at these events after an hour or so, and they don't seem to rotate out. Don't know if that'll change as dogs come back from Afghanistan/Iraq, or, for that matter, how many of the dogs they're using in US are actual drug dogs vs 'show of force' pseudo-drug-dogs that are actually explosives dogs with handlers... was going to look out for this next year when they changed them out. There were not that many 'hits' from certain teams, I noticed.

    There were sniffer dogs at the Cup mate. LEs behaved themselves, but yes there were sniffers. Not as much as at other events because they know they can't get away with it. btw, I agree thoough, LEs and festivals don't mix. They sit on their asses when an assault or even sexual attack is perpetrated but go out of their way to ruin a concert.

    No doubt. It was on the news; they were politely going through the crowds with the dogs, looking fairly relaxed. Probably DIDN'T go through the tents, like you say. It actually looked a bit put on for the cameras. They're usually not that friendly. Piece.

        The festivals I go to they ask to see your drugs. I've shown them a QP of weed, about a half ounce of mdma, 50+ tabs and vials of this and that for a group of 6 people and that was totally acceptable. They're more concerned with people bringing in 500 dirty e pills.

    CANADA?!?!?!?!  :o
    <br/>
    I was expecting a European country. Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany or around that area.

    Well think yourself lucky. Getting into a festival in Australia is worse than getting through airport security.
