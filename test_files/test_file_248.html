    How I DIDN'T receive 2 grams RC's from UK to Norway
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Norwegian customs opened a brown, standard envelope with my name on it containing 2 baggies; 1g Ethylphenidate &amp; 1g Methiopropamine, and called the police on me.
    <br/>
    Why?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs stated: "The customs authorities may seize and report illegal importation of drugs. It is not common procedure to notify the specified recipient before a case is reported to the police. When an import is reported, it is because the customsemployee who controlled the packet has reason to believe that the items are illegal or illegally imported. The case is also considered by those who review if our cases go on to the police. So, there are two seperate sections in our system that both decided that this import was illegal, and now it is the police who should review the matter. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This import is "illegal" because....:"There was no documentation with the shipment. It was also undeclared. But the point here is that you at the time should have documented that the drugs were legally acquired abroad. Such evidence did not follow the pack, and you made an illegal importation of drugs . "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The police said;"When someone reports that a crime has been comitted, we have to investigate, and investigation shows that there has been done a breach of the Medicines Act"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police also found enough "proof" that I've broken the Medicines Act, even though I never had any opportunity to find out if of these drugs were classified as pharmaceuticals in any norwegian laws. This is called "negligence" by the police, since the norwegian drug list "is incomplete".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Referring to what "killed" me, as a warning:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    § 2 of the Medicines Act: "With drugs shall in this Act drugs, drugs and drugs that are specific to or issued to be used to prevent, cure or alleviate disease symptoms of illness or pain, affect physiological functions in humans or animals, or by internal or external use to detect disease. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "A product with no pharmacological effect can be classified as a drug if it is marketed with claims of medical efficacy. Classification is done on the basis of an overall assessment, where both the product form (drug-like shape) and the statements used will be key."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "It must be certified by the customs authorities that the goods purchased legally. documentation can be the receipt from the pharmacy / retailer or endorsement by prescription from the pharmacy. If these conditions are met, the package leaves the office / post it directly to addressee. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Waiting for a fine and now I know what not to do.

    Thats too bad, sorry to hear.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, did you admit to ordering these items?
    <br/>
    As far as I know, Norwegian laws will place the "burden of proof" on the police until they can prove that you ordered the items yourself. With the several anonymity layers provided by SR and the BTC payment system I can't really see how they could prove that the order was related to you in anyway (besides the address on the letter of course).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I was just wondering if you actually did admit to anything or if they are trying to give you a fine for something they can't prove. If so, I would consider not accepting the fine if I were you..

    Scandinavian laws  are different. They can gift for you jail time/or penalty. Same as Sweden,Finland,Norway and Denmark. This is not usa or central EU state.

    I'm sorry but I didn't quite comprehend those sentences. Could you re-phrase that post for me?
    <br/>
    I don't understand what you mean by "gift for you". And I mean no offense at all, but I just can't understand whether that means something positive or negative?
