    When a package arrives to Italian customs there must be a description of whats inside. If not Customs will contact the receiver to fill out a form that declares whats inside the package (it has to be specific you cannot put gift or personal items), the value ( you cannot put 0 value they wont accept it), and proof of purchase; e.g a pay palÂ  receipt or order confirmation of some sort. only then will they release the product. If there is no receiver info (phone number or email) provided by the sender, They will send a notice to the residence to come into the post to fill out this form. This no big deal if receiving legal goods but when importing drugs its a different story. so what happens? they never go, they don't get a Love letter because the product wasn't checked it just gets return to the return address if provided or get thrown out after a while. and then the buyer tells the vendor they never got it. you may only have to fill out the form if the sender doesn't put the contents of the package so you are stating you know whats inside and that you acknowledge your order of whatever is inside. at this time they release the package to your local post office. : ) You can imagine the balls you have to have to do that. but if the vendor attaches a email and fake receipt to the packages and declares it as something legal (some people use jolly rancher candy pack and actually put it inside). you will have a better chance of receiving your product and with a fake receipt and acknowledging you are receiving Candy it dismisses you from being charged with attempting to receive drugs through the mail. and this is only if you have to fill out this form and if they open and see its drugs you have proof of what you ordered, candy and not drugs. My idea is for open communication of both parties to decided the contents and the value, a fake recipe and use a throwaway email address that they will send the form to if necessary. fill it out and send it back (via email) and you should have no problems they will not open the package unless it gets a hit or there are drugs sticking out of it. this will save you a pick up trip to the post. I will translate the form and required info and post for vendors and buyers a like. this applies only to packages and not letters. Any questions ill try my best to answer them.

    I thought Italy was inside the European Union? And so doesn't require custom declarations from other EU countries? Unless you're more of talking about US sellers to Italy etc. Also I thought customs forms were pretty much universal worldwide? Why would they have a policy of refusing items marked at gifts or personal items when these are options on customs forms?

    I did some research and yes you are correct about not having to fill out custom deceleration from inside EU but it depends on the country and what you are shipping. some countries and or cities dont have good shipping reputations are considered outside of the EU in terms of shipping. there is no list i could find but you can check on post italy and search your country to see restrictions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for EU to EU packets this is what i found, translated for convience
    <br/>
    "Shipments addressed to "Mailboxes" ARE NOT ACCEPTED. All shipments still need the exact name of the consignee, complete address (street, house, building, floor and apartment number). The recipient's phone is MANDATORY and must be marked on the shipping documentation. The recipient information on the accompanying documentation, must be identical to those that are found on the expedition."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and for OUTSIDE EU :
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "All the information to fill in customs declarations correctly.
    <br/>
    Customs declarations for the shipment of packages containing small quantities of goods to be shipped in Zones outside the EU must be accompanied by CN 22 or CN23 forms depending on the declared value. Forms are available at all post offices and must be filled in correctly, completely and legibly.
    <br/>
    In particular, you must indicate the quantity, nature and value of the object to be sent."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks Reich i will update my post to non EU countries until i get more info
