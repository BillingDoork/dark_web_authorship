    I ordered 5 pills of xanax about 6 days ago and it should be here by now. I also have 2 grams of mdma coming from the united kingdom. The pills should have been here two days ago and now the USPS is calling my mom asking her if we have recieved any packages that weren't ours or if we had seen someone tempering with our mailbox. I'm so confused, if they found the pills then why wouldn't they just come and arrest me? Someone help me out please I am very worried about the mdma coming I think my address has been flagged and they are investigating me. Has this happened to anyone else??

    Yes, consider your address compromised, and don't order anything illicit to it. As a first time occurrence there's not much that can happen so just deny everything and act clueless about any packages you recieve. If you continue to use this address it will be very suspicious and there will be a much larger chance for an investigation to happen. So take this warning for what it is and don't order to that address again.

    Another interesting piece of information I forgot to include is the fact that this is the second time they have called my mom on her work phone. The first time she didn't answer and they left a message saying to call them back, they didn't give any reason. So we called the number for usps and told them her name and that she had been asked to call them back and they knew nothing of it. We then got transferred to the local usps office still nobody knew what we were talking about. then two days later she gets the call I was talking about in the original post. Something seems very strange. Maybe they are trying to talk to my mom because they think she is more likely to talk. Everything I've received has been in my name. They haven't made any attempt to call me. The fact that they found my moms work number is very disturbing. I would love any feedback from anyone that has experienced anything like this. Thanks

    Do a forum search for "usps phone call" or something of that sort. I've read someone's post a few months ago who received strange calls from USPS on his cell and home phone, and eventually receved a package late with random phone numbers and names scratched onto a note stickied on the package. This sounds strangely familiar and there was no explanation for this occurrence either. Strange indeed.

    I can verify the USPS Postal inspectors have access to your numbers, via services like lexis nexis, they even have access to your cell phone numbers. I was actually having a kinda scary talk with my local postal inspector, as i was dropping off drugs to ship. He had just got done tearing open some media mail parcels, because there was black spots in the XRAY's. He then came over to the register to help me. as he was helping me he proceeded to tell me with media mail they are allowed to rip every package up and verify they are cd's or books.... Then he went on to tell me all the time people try to hallow out books, fill them with drugs then plastic shrink wrap them. He went on to explain to me that the only really protected mail was First Class, saying that first class mail is for private correspondence only and is protected by the constitution. He then went on to tell me priority and express mail is usable for parcels, and therefore it is not protected, and he can rip them open as often as he wants. He went on to ask me the standard, is there anything hazardous or explosive. I began to panic and i was like so what would happen if I was shipping drugs in this very envelope, he proceeded to tell me He sees me in there daily that he knows when a package has drugs. LMAO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then he really showed how cocky he was when he stated, the postal inspectors are not who you want to fuck with, that having a postal inspector show up at your door might as well be a officer, a judge, and a jury. Something about they can do there own detective work, make arrest and get warrants for anything doesn't have to be postal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW I didnt know till I had my talk with him that postal inspectors carry guns, and badges, they are protected as federal officers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if i was you, id have your mom call them back and tell them you keep getting mail in your name that doesnt belong to you.

     4. Can Postal Inspectors open mail if they feel it may contain something illegal?
     <br/>
     First-Class letters and parcels are protected against search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and, as such, cannot be opened without a search warrant. If there is probable cause to believe the contents of a First-Class letter or parcel violate federal law, Postal Inspectors can obtain a search warrant to open the mailpiece. Other classes of mail do not contain private correspondence, and therefore may be opened without a warrant.

    Good news, I'm not in jail. My mdma came without any problems so I don't think there is going to be any investigation. My xanax never came though, but I'm not worried about that. Thanks for the help guys.

    DUDE! You are not in jail this time, but do not ship to that address ever again. I would not use your name to ship to anywhere else in that county or state either. Get a new name/address combo asap.
