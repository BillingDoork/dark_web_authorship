    This may have been posted previously, but I noticed this a few days ago when using express.

    The carbon copy self adhesive labels that you can stick on anything, the new ones have the to/from address part just formatted differently to be easier to distinguish between the two it seems, and the tracking number already included (just like the previous ones). What is a great change imo is that before those labels had a box to check for 'waiver of signature' with a signature of the sender needed in order to do so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, the box you check is FOR the signature, to request the deliveryman to make the recipient sign. Too many of the express mailers I have sent with the signature waived box checked, and signed have been delivered, and yet signature was still requested.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is obviously an issue for drugs in the mail, potentially. In summation, my hypothesis is that the new signature "request" instead of "waiver" is nothing but good news to those of us receiving packages that we shouldn't be signing for. I bet the USPS will still screw it up for awhile though, keep asking for signatures when they don't need to... Either way if they are starting to prefer dropping off express packages and then taking off ASAP, then well fine by me.

    USPS has been slowly moving to change the default status of signature required Express mail for at least a year now.  Whereas previously, the default was signature required unless sender authorized waiver of the requirement ...they are now turning that policy around 180 degrees.  New procedure for Express will be generally no signature required for delivery unless sender specifically requests it.  This is an obvious cost cutting measure that will drastically cut down on Express mail re-deliveries and having to be handled more than once.  FedEx/UPS has been doing it this way since forever ..the PO is just now catching up.
