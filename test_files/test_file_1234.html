    JUNE 7--A high-tech computer system that captures images of  “every mail piece that is processed” by the United State Postal Service was critical in helping federal agents track the Texas woman arrested today for allegedly sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In a U.S. District Court complaint filed today against Shannon Guess Richardson, an FBI agent details how investigators traced the ricin letters back to New Boston, Texas, where the 35-year-old Richardson (seen below) lives with her husband.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Bloomberg letter was opened at a municipal mail center in Manhattan on May 24, while the letter to Obama was intercepted May 30 at an off-site White House mail facility. A third ricin letter--sent to an anti-gun group funded by Bloomberg--was received at a Washington, D.C. office on May 26.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to FBI Agent James Spiropoulos, investigators accessed a Postal Service computer system that “incorporates a Mail Isolation Control and Tracking (MICT) program which photographs and captures an image of every mail piece that is processed.” Agents were able to obtain front and back images of about 20 mail pieces that had been processed “immediately before the mail piece addressed to Mayor Bloomberg.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A review of that mail revealed that each piece carried return addresses listing zip codes in the New Boston area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A similar analysis of 40 mail pieces that were processed “immediately before and after the mail piece addressed to President Obama” showed that several of those letters listed addresses in two Texas cities near New Boston.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to the felony complaint against Richardson, she confessed yesterday to “mailing the three letters--knowing that they contained ricin.” She repeated earlier claims that her husband Nathaniel, who has not been charged, was involved with the Obama and Bloomberg mailings. Richardson alleged that her spouse “typed the letters and made her print and mail them,” reported Agent Spiropoulos.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If convicted of the ricin mailings, Richardson, an aspiring actress, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and fine of up to $250,000. (10 pages)

    And stop trying to kill people with poison in the mail, you idiots. What the hell. And the PRESIDENT? You HONESTLY think he's going to open his own mail, after the antrhax incident years ago?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NO.

    The mass stupidity of these people is frightening.

    Agreed. It is definitely pretty scary that the US Govt. can do that. I'd imagine it is like that in other countries too, is that totally wrong? &lt;----- Honest Question Btw. It seems like this system has been in place for awhile, and more importantly it seems like what they were doing wasn't impossible for them, tracking the woman who sent the Ricin that is. I think that the takeaway lesson here is that they haven't done that to any SR vendors yet, and it's interesting to wonder why not. I'm still not exactly sure how this works btw, a better explaination would be awesome. It seems as if you would still need to be on camera?

    Well for one, almost all SR orders aren't detected. I can't say how they got all 3 of them before they got to their destination, or was it just 2? Probably scanners for poison or something. Anyway once you discover someone sent ricin to the president you go fucking get them. You know they spared no expense, I'm sure she was on camera and they knew where and when it was mailed from. Or maybe they were really dumb and left prints or something. Anyway what a bitch ratting out her husband. Even if she was being abused that's pretty much the best opportunity to get rid of the guy ever. BEFORE you mail them anyway.

    I'm a second grader.  I just learned multiplication.  My teacher has big boobies and my daddy beats me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But seriously, I've even seen it mentioned in another thread before.  How do you think the machines sort the mail and know what address?  They snap pictures of the packages at lightning speed as they fly through the machine! :)  I figured everyone understood this.  People can't believe that every postal hub sorts packages and envelopes by hand can they? ???  Lol ;D
