    Hello dear friends,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wanted to say and ask some things about Sweden and Swedish customs.
    <br/>
    I was really worried before my first purchases about my letters would be caught. Till now everything have worked fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just for encouraging future buyers from Sweden I will say some examples of orders that were successfully received.
    <br/>
    Lsd
    <br/>
    dmt
    <br/>
    mdma
    <br/>
    an I also got my 12g weed. (that was the most risky in my personal opinion)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So Swedish people, don't worry, everything arrives safely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I want to ask a question. So ok, stuff can come easily in here. But what about sending drugs out of Sweden? I have some friends who are interested in some small portions of lsd and dmt (and they really don't have the patience of signing up, bitcoins etc etc) and I was thinking to send them some stuff. Do you think it would work as easy  it is to receive stuff?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    I am not Swedish, but LSD and DMT should be easy to send since drug dogs can not smell them.
    <br/>
    Sweden is also not a popular country for drugs. For example packages from Holland will be flagged because they have a reputation.

     <br/>

    I'm from Sweden myself, It is not very hard controlled border but of course it can be caught. depends on from what country you order from and so on. if i recall right we only have 2-3 dogs at Arlanda airport for the mail and guess they are smelling mostly on the brown bags from Netherlands and other flagged country's. For you question, as said it is no problem sending out of Sweden since it is "known" as a "good", because we do not earn on sending drugs to other country's as the manufacturer does. we do not produce. And if you meant that if our border is strict when you send mail, we don't. the country that ships the mail never checks it. they leave that to the border in the country it arrives to. And if anyone sees this i have a question.
    <br/>
    Is it Anyway possible for LSD blotters to get caught by the custom? Feels like it CANT get stuck.. so easy to hide and no smell... :)
