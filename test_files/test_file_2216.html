    Stealth packaging... User anonymity. Most people have the address on an encrypted HDD... then delete it after it is mailed.. or have it written down.. then once mailed it is burned. People do things differently.. but from what I have seen most people do everything 110% legit.. and to the safety of the buyer.. as well as the vendor. :) Hope this helped.

    Aside from selecting a trusted vendor, you also assume some risk when ordering. Your product may be intercepted and seized, and consequently may or may not be flagged (more likely with non-pharmaceuticals). In this case, you'll likely only receive a notice of seizure letter, and it is recommended not to attempt import again without testing your address to check whether or not it is flagged.

    I think you might have come to the wrong forum. What products? Why would i be worried about comprimising my location?
    <br/>
    I think maybe you should do more homework on your surroundings, maybe do a little learning by yourself, that way you won't expose yourself as an ingnorant, lazy asshole who wants everything done for them!
