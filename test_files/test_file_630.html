    Okay, now I doubt anyone really saw my other thread so I guess I'll just explain again. I got a letter from sheriff's office involving confiscated Methamphetamine/MDMA that I didn't order in the first place. I have two other packages coming, one of these however IS MDMA now, I received the letter after making the order and after they've been shipped out...and I was pretty sure one of those was supposed to arrive today unless it's just taking a little longer, pretty sure my address is flagged so I'd like to get rid of any history/searches/photos/etc involving drug involvement in any way, I prefer not to restore my whole system. I've heard of using Eraser to "permanently" destroy any history for the Recycle Bin as an example, not sure if anyone here has tried it though or anything. Can anyone help me out before Im fucked?

    Make a copy of your stuff that you need, buy a cheap HDD, smash the current one to pieces with a sledgehammer or magnet it. If the feds are on your ass, they are gonna restore shit from it if you don't, and I wouldn't trust "Eraser" and shit like that. However I may be wrong, so experts feel free to correct me.

    The hdd works like a old cassettetape.
    <br/>
    To remove data it has to be overwritten.
    <br/>
    There is no such thing as erase , delete , format or anything else that is quicker then the time you needed to put the data there in the first place. How do you delete a old cassette tape? Only by recording something new over the old data.
    <br/>
    Usually that method takes to much time.
    <br/>
    Delete what you want to remove and use the Guttman wipe of 36 times in and after the use of ccleaner.
    <br/>
    Text and pictures will be fragmented after that.
    <br/>
    Killdisk is a quick program, but if you want to sure, you will have to destroy the ceramic disk inside physically.
    <br/>
    Not just one blow with a hammer, but smash the hdd very good.
    <br/>
    The inside disk has to be in a lot of pieces, in order to be safe.

    ^^^This, but personally I would be disposing of that computer hard drive altogether, smashed and scattered to the 4 winds where no one would ever find the pieces. For the cost of a replacement HD compared to what my liberty is worth I know what option I'd be taking.

    Why not light the drive on fire rather than sit there and beat it with a hammer for half an hour? Or pawn the computer... its probably time for an upgrade anyway.

    Keep in mind that it is a holiday weekend here in the US and you might not get any mail till Tuesday. So take a few deep breaths and relax a bit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you still feel the need to wipe your HD before you do boot and nuke step don't forget to also wipe the free memory also to be a clean as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep in mind that if you take a while to run. A bootable usb drive would be better for you in the future.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep on mind also that if LE was planning on paying you a visit I don't think they would have sent you a we are on our way to get you so kindly destroy all evidence so we will not have case against you letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You obviously want to be on guard but don't give yourself a heart attack. I know thats like telling a starving man not to be hungry. I am sure I would be worried if I were in your shoes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally, remember it isn't yours. You didn't order it. Which is actually true in this case.

    Take everything off your HD that you want to save and put it on a flash drive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take your HD out and drill holes in it all the way through and throw it out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Put in a new HD, reinstall your OS and put back your stuff off the flash drive. Except anything that relates to this site. (ie links, tor, btc wallet ect), leave all that on the flash drive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then encrypt the drive with BitLocker or something similar.

    Yes, this is overkill. But whats $50 on another drive VS jail.

    Also instead of a flash drive you can use something like a Micro SD. Its super small and very very easy to hide even in plain sight.

    I still see people quoting the Gutmann 35 method. It was never intended to use all 35 wipes on a single hard drive. Gutmann designed the 35 wipes to use multiple methods in cases where you don't know what type of drive it is, but for any known drive, only a subset were supposed to be used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, it's pretty well established at this point that a single random write is sufficient to make all data unrecoverable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology says, "[F]or ATA disk drives manufactured after 2001 (over 15 GB) clearing by overwriting the media once is adequate to protect the media from both keyboard and laboratory attack."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Center for Magnetic Recording Research says, "The U.S. National Security Agency published an Information Assurance Approval of single pass overwrite, after technical testing at CMRR showed that multiple on-track overwrite passes gave no additional erasure."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_erasure#Number_of_overwrites_needed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Write et al. performed their own tests and found that a single overwrite was sufficient.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wright, Craig; Kleiman, Dave; Sundhar R.S., Shyaam. Overwriting Hard Drive Data: The Great Wiping Controversy. In R. Sekar, R.; Pujari, Arun K.. "Information Systems Security". Information Systems Security: 4th International Conference, ICISS 2008. http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-89862-7_21
    <br/>
    <br/>
    More here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99520.msg699299#msg699299
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The most important feature of a random overwrite is to do the whole disk, not individual files. Files can be written to multiple locations of a disk, and overwriting an individual file only writes over its last location.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You also need to use a tool that is not running on the host OS. The host OS usually reserves blocks which won't be overwritten by any tools running on the host OS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You need a bootable program like DBAN. Run the "nuke" option with 3 writes (2 random, 1 with zeroes) and the data will be unrecoverable. Then reinstall the OS and use full disk encryption so this isn't an issue in the future.

    What you have posted here is mis-information that could place someone in jeopardy if they are ever caught. Drilling holes in a HDD may make it inoperable and unable to be used in a PC as per the norm, however throwing out a HDD without wiping it with software such as dban is basically leaving incriminating evidence lying around for anyone to see should they decide to look inside. Drilling holes in it will not prevent any of the data from being recovered.
    <br/>
    BitLocker is not safe or secure enough if your serious about Encryption. It's been cracked before and is more of a "toy" in relation to other professional Encryption software available. Microsoft isn't known for producing such software and a hacker with only basic skills would have no trouble in cracking this software and accessing any file they wanted. Truercrypt is an example of true Encryption software which is a very secure alternative, able to be configured in a variety of ways from full drive encryption through to running it on a flash drive in Portable Mode. More importantly though, it has yet to be cracked by hackers worldwide, putting it in the same boat as Gpg (PGP) software, and offers industrial strength encryption for free, keeping all your info, extremely secure. It's best to make sure your comments are fact before posting to prevent others reading your post from potentially making some big mistakes.

     What you have posted here is mis-information that could place someone in jeopardy if they are ever caught. Drilling holes in a HDD may make it inoperable and unable to be used in a PC as per the norm, however throwing out a HDD without wiping it with software such as dban is basically leaving incriminating evidence lying around for anyone to see should they decide to look inside. Drilling holes in it will not prevent any of the data from being recovered.

     BitLocker is not safe or secure enough if your serious about Encryption. It's been cracked before and is more of a "toy" in relation to other professional Encryption software available. Microsoft isn't known for producing such software and a hacker with only basic skills would have no trouble in cracking this software and accessing any file they wanted. Truercrypt is an example of true Encryption software which is a very secure alternative, able to be configured in a variety of ways from full drive encryption through to running it on a flash drive in Portable Mode. More importantly though, it has yet to be cracked by hackers worldwide, putting it in the same boat as Gpg (PGP) software, and offers industrial strength encryption for free, keeping all your info, extremely secure. It's best to make sure your comments are fact before posting to prevent others reading your post from potentially making some big mistakes.

    That's is correct you would have a better chance with a magnet than a power drill.

    So then you only need 3 runs with an erasing program + a boot and nuke program.

    Would be good to know just in case. Doubt anyone would ever take enough interest in me to spend too much time and resources to find out what's on my computer or VM usb drive. But its always good practice to be ready just in case the unthinkable should happen.

    Sorry mate!  :( The more I look at it, I'm beginning to think it is a little bizarre SSBD, especially now that I've realized he has no eyes and can't see a thing! That's probably why he is screaming. Either that or the prick had some red hot Meth and is going a 100 miles an hour, totally off his chops. Some people have all the luck!  ::)

    OK, I bought that last bloke a Guide Dog, gave him a couple of Xanax and sent him on his way! He did freak me out a little once you said that SSBD. Anyway, I've given Pete Griffin his old job back and he's already back at work, entertaining me anyway. :)
