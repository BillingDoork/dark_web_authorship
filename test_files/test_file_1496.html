    Hello SR Community,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am reaching out to those who can provide some valuable insight to the standard behavior of USPS tracking (dealing with Express International packages, in particular).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I have one package coming from overseas that says that it was already 'Processed Through ISC' two days ago and it hasn't been updated yet. Now, I know that this is normal with regular Priority parcels, but shouldn't Express be handled more quickly? The destination is actually fairly close to the ISC; just one state away. Should I be worried at this point, or is this fairly normal for USPS Express International?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The tracking for my other Express International package is showing slightly more peculiar behavior. I was expecting this package to arrive at its destination address a few days go, but tracking said 'Processed Through Sort Facility' and 'Depart From Sort Facility' three different times at the SAME sort facility before it finally updated to 'Arrival at Unit' in the same city as the destination address. This last update is from yesterday, but there have been no further updates today. Usually, after the 'Arrival at Unit' tracking update, it should be out for delivery and delivered the next day at the latest, but there has been no updates. Shouldn't there be more urgency for an Express International package? Is this suspicious or am I getting worried too soon?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else experienced this kind of behavior when dealing with Express International packages to the US? The vendor that shipped the packages has pretty great stealth and I have received many successful packages from him with Express International. Any valuable insight would be mucho appreciated and appropriately receive GOOD KARMA in return :)

    Sit back and be patient, customs always takes longer than usual.
    <br/>
    Just because its Express doesn't mean it will be in and out that fast.
    <br/>
    They are usually backed up, and dont be surprised if you wait a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should get it if its in customs w/ stealth, nothing to worry about.
    <br/>
    I've also waited a week in customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that helps!

    ISC has been slow lately.  Some of my registered mail packages have sat in ISC for about 72 hours at times.  Don't stress too much, you'll probably see movement today or sunday/monday.

    Thanks guys! Does anyone have any ideas in regards to my other expected package that has been slowly moving towards its destination (it was processed through the same sort facility 3 times) and now, the tracking update has said 'Arrival at Unit' since yesterday morning? It seems strange that it would have arrived at the local PO yesterday morning, but it wasn't sent out for delivery yesterday or today (and it is an EXPRESS international package, not just Priority Airmail)...

    Was this an "Express" package? I have also shared your experience with slow delivery times, but it was never for an Express package. My Express package, in particular, that I am waiting on now has already made it to the local PO of the destination address, but it has not been sent out for delivery and it has been about 4 days now. It seems very strange that it would make it through Customs and everything and then get held up at the last stop on its delivery path.
