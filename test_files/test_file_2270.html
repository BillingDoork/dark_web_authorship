    I shipped weed (under oz) from Denver to my friend in Kansas and it never made it. I double vacuumed it and put it in envelope with bubble wraps inside. I done it few times and never had problem. Then my friend pointed me to article in denverpost where it says that usps has special force or something like that in state of colorado where they send all packages suspected having drugs to special detention center. Denver post office actually assumes that every package might have canabis in it. Anyone had same issue shipping from here?
    <br/>
    I'm not really worry about security just curios since colorado allows mmj does usps xrays or whatever to all packages coming from here

    no idea except that the one and only order i have ever NOT received from SR was from a weed vendor in Colorado.Â  i trust that he shipped it, but somewhere in between it must have been intercepted because i never received it.
