    Has anyone ever successfully got anything from India to Ireland?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I remember a few yrs ago I made 2 attempts and both were intercepted. Both small amounts. Just got a love letter on both occasions. I'm very keen to try and get my hands on some Modafinil but it seems the only place to order this from is India. I remember one site a few years ago would actually ship your order to the UK, have it repackaged and reshipped to Ireland. The site has since been shut down almost a year ago now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am wondering if either there is a vendor that offers a similar service or else if there are any EU vendors that usually ship Modafinil who just have no listings up at the moment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers,

    Yes he is also in India. I would sooner order something else like dexedrine from the eu than risk making an order from India again. Thanks tho.  :)

    Cheers googleyed1. I am definitely not going to try it again. The bother it caused me years ago was definitely not worth it. Given it was a fake name at the time and a different address than I live at now.  The shipping time is so long that you have this "what if" hanging over your head for much too long. But I was much younger and naive to this whole sort of thing at the time. SR has really open my eyes to the ins and outs of safety, security etc. But I am still curious to know if anything ever actually makes it trough. I can't imagine that there is a whole pile of legitimate mail comes from India to Ireland. I was watching the Irish customs tv show a few weeks ago and they were saying the majority of what they find all comes from India.

    Thanks ahuhol for mentioning me :)
    <br/>
    You are awesome.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I don't directly ship to Ireland from India.
    <br/>
    I ship the package to my friend in UK.
    <br/>
    He forwards it ahead to Ireland. (And to other EU countries like Germany, Norway, Sweden.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I charge $24 extra than my usual price because it costs anywhere from $15 to $23 (depending on the country and the exchange rate) to reship from UK.
    <br/>
    But even with this extra $24, my prices are pretty low and reasonable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just this past week, 2 orders were successfully delivered to Ireland.

    Sorry ahuhol, my bad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's great news. Thanks for your help. I'd +1 you if I had enough posts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @medsforbitcoin I will be in contact in maybe a week or so. I just placed an order from another vendor today for something similar but I am really curious to try this modafinil as I've heard great things and there's still plenty of college to go.

    A friend of mine has successfully used this service (I believe he was the first) and he/we were very satisfied. @m4b: there might be a new order soon as I robbed him of his last Waklert :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For sun modafinil, m4b is the best choice.
