    Need a good Third party package tracking proxy site seeming everyone thinks that you shouldnt track your packages through Tor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will give Karma to everyone who posts one as a few different options would be great.

    I honestly dont think that they would be able to flag tor IP's as new exit nodes would be popping up all the time, remember its a network run by volunteers but a proxy IP would be well known so thats probably a worse idea. I want a bunch of those package tracking sites that just tracks every package trackable.

    USPS is a company being pulled apart at the seams .. closing plants, laying off workers, cutting services ... the last thing they do is track who tracks what packages on USPS.com ... seriously. Even if they find packages being tracked with TOR, how can they intercept most of them ? Most of their packages labels are written in pen and not individually scanned.

    Once again, myths.

    I'm definitely inclined to agree with fredflinstone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HOWEVER, I favor packagetrackr.com, too. Though it was already posted so... :)
