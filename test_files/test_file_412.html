    This has been around for a while. Its a type of packing tape that if its lifted off the package and retaped or if its cut, it will show up and there is no way, supposedly, to conceal the fact the package was opened. The tape has lines in it and if its cut and put back, the lines will never match up so looking at it closely will reveal it was opened. This would be mostly for shipments where you have to sign for it. In usa at least they can't execute a search warrant when they intercept a shipment unless the addressee signs for it or in some cases takes the package inside.

    There is another type of tape that you can't tell its tamper resistant because about 2 hours after its been removed and restuck, it puts a warning underneath onto the package. But you have to lift up the tape to see the warning. The other type you can see just by looking at the outside.
    <br/>

    Does anyone think this is a good thing for vendors to use? If you go to your mailbox and see the package has been tampered with, you can leave it in the box and possibly avoid a bust.
