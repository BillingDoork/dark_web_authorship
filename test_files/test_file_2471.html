    i don't think anybody knows for sure, i bet it depends on your situation. a lot of people still order after packs go missing, but i find that russian roulette. they might be watching your mail a little closely. parcels/international stuff will most likely be looked over twice before delivery.

    Much more likely that outgoing addresses are hot listed rather than inbound ones. There is in example lets say a mid sized City all of a sudden has an increase of domestic or international mail raises a yellow flag. Someone has a look at the figures and random packages are removed before sorting to be given a once over. If the numbers are consistently high for a period and a certain percent of pack come up dirty then an amber flag is raised. Analysis of the dirty packs then takes place looking for commonality like packaging etc and/or things like return address not matching the City sent from and so on. If this data then collates into a picture that looks like a continued and bulk distribution enterprise then the red flag goes up and shit hits the fan....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That can scale up to be state, country or even down to specific sorting centers and so on. Its easier to control the water as it comes out of the tap rather than wherever it end it ends up if you follow.It is afterall the dealers and not the end users most LE is after.

    I don't know if there are hot listed addresses but i do know they use sorters now that read both the sending and return addy. If the return is fake they will know it. They won't automatically try to get a warrant but it *could* mean a clerk looks it over to see if it seems suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Machines reading addresses means that they could hot list you or your sender and all mail to or from there gets the fine tooth comb. They are so busy i doubt it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You want to test your address? Soak something in perfume and send it to yourself. That is a red flag and they may present it to a dog if they have any other suspicions. If it gets through with no delay then you are definitely not hot listed because if you were, they would certainly present it to the dog because strong odors are considered a strong tip off even if its coffee or something else. And that takes extra time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Want to screw with the post office? Mail a letter without your return addy on it, rub some smelly bud all over the outside of it. This will not only make them want to open it but it will rub off on other mail which will cause dogs and sniffers to alert to the other mail as well. The more false positives they get the more likely they are to ignore them.

    First, send something "suspicious" to your own address with tracking enabled. Something like aspiring pills mixed with the scent of a prime steak or anything that is remotely suspicious to LE and their sniff dogs. My guess is it will make it through because as low as you might rate LE, they don't usually have enough resources to place surveillance on small-time criminals and their postal activity. Of course, if you have attempted to import or export large amounts of any drugs, it's a whole different story.
