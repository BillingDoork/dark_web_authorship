    So I'm using a PO box to receive my shipments and there is a lot of debate over real or fake name. Now so far I have opened a PO box in my real name because really there is no way around it because I have to provide two forms of identification. Which puts me at a loss because who is to say the feds aren't posing as a seller and I would have to give them my name to get it shipped to me. Sounds pretty retarded to me. My idea is I can add someone to my PO box to receive mail but then they wouldn't be tied to the address which the PO box is under so I hear that's a no no.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone provide any help or methods that have worked for them?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    authorities (in sane countries) typically can't sell you drugs. At least, that is the idea (however if you are a major distributor who knows what laws they may bend to help get you).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they could seize a package, substitute powder, and then try to get you red handed though.

    in the same situation as you.. im considering getting professionally done fake id's ordered from SR vendors and using those to get fake id's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now you have already gone through the process of getting a po box you will know what to expect and what they ask.. that is valuable experience to get yourself confident if you decide to get properly done fake id's and get a fake name po box created.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    other people can chip in but in my opinion having your real name on the po box is not going to give you any protection.. i wouldnt use that po box...  look up the counterfeit id's section on silk road and get yourself several types and create a good fake identity profile.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also when you do get a fake po box you want to start signing up for some genuinely decent mailing lists and stuff just to get it working.. create some "noise" for the po box so its not only your naughty stuff going there.. dont be silly with the kind of noise though and overload it with nonsense.. get some noise like: something religious, something abaout finance and something about computer deals would be fine.. send yourself some stuff too

    well im not making any big purchases nothing over half a g and no weed that just seems stupid to me. It just seems crazy to give someone who you have no idea who they are. Feedback can be bs feds can make multiple accounts  just like me and you and get tons of feedback that way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think im just going to add another name onto my PO for receiving mail and use that name. But then that brings up the point of that person will not show up under the address the PO box is listed under.

    Get a fake ID + fake health card, make sure you go to a place with little to no cameras and never point your face directly towards the camera. PO boxes do auto signatures so you are accepting the package, since they have your ID And health card there is no way to prove that you didn't send that. They will sit there and wait. Get a fake ID, seriously. that way when you see a package is seized you ditch the cards and never go back. They will now be looking for the fake you as opposed to you. Yes its harder to get a fake ID and go through the trouble but this is online drug vending its not made to be simple. So be smart and dont take the easy way out. It will fuck you in the end.

    Good advice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The second form of ID needs tied to a physical address.  It's not hard to do some research and get some forged documents that show the same address as the ID.

    I just want to point out the other side of this topic.  There are absolutely more anonymous ways to receive your SR goods, but...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If something illegal is delivered to a PO Box, it is very difficult to catch the receiver red handed, since police don't know when or if you will even pick it up.  They will have had to first identify that something was illegal, then they need to catch you in the act of receiving it.  The first part of that is rare enough--with reputable vendors, chances are close to 0.  Past that, I don't see how LEO hand-delivering your package to a physical location, where someone is expected to be present, is any less likely to be pursued, than putting it in your PO Box and waiting indefinitely for you to claim it.  Would they really deliver a box, and then post a police officer at the PO box location 24/7 until they can apprehend you?  It seems to me like PO Boxes offer slightly *more* protection than using a physical location, since you as the receiver can wait until 03:00 in the morning to get your package, rather than relying on your postal worker (or LEO) to deliver it to a location.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't misunderstand me, I know that the correct way to go is to deliver to a safe "dead drop", where you are not connected to the address, yet there is no risk of the postal service becoming suspicious (and ideally, no risk of anyone close to you being connected to the delivery).  I would recommend this route to everyone.  But for the other buyers who routinely have packages delivered to actual residences (yours or someone elses), is it really any safer than delivering to a PO box in any way?  I mean most of the issues surrounding delivery to a residence can be equally argued when considering delivery to a PO Box, no?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I severely misguided here?

    Well if it is delivered to a house that you are not holding it in it is safe. You just write "return to sender"on it and not open it till it is in the house you can hold it in. Cuz then when they bust in your friend says "I never received this" That is as long as they didn't sign. If it is still in the house the friend then says "I was returning it because I was not expecting an envelope from here." PO boxes automatically sign for you which shows claim that you recieved it so you can't play dumb anymore. But dead drops are also not safe, delivering to a location that has no residency, business, etc is a red flag. Getting a PO box under a fake name is the safest way IMO. Cuz you can always ditch it and they will have no clue.

    What does it mean, "PO boxes automatically sign for you"?  I routinely have to sign for Express packages that get delivered to my PO Box, with the same information I have to sign for an Express package delivered to my office.  If they auto-signed, then that Express Packages wouldn't have been securely delivered, which is the entire point of the signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you proposing that a standard letter that gets put into a mailbox at your home is not "signed", but that the same letter put in your PO Box is "signed", even though it doesn't require any signature?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The signature *is not* meant to indicate that the party signing is taking posession of the contents--just of the package.  The signature is only meant to indicate that the package (with no regard to the contents), was delivered to the addressee.  If I have drugs shipped to my place of employment, would they really arrest the receptionist when she signs for it?  The idea of the postal signature is really pointless when discussing the legality surrounding "possession of the contents of a delivered parcel."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The terms of use for a USPS PO Box only vaguely indicate that illegal uses are not permitted, and the same provision is applicable to a residential address as for a PO Box.  They make no mention of signatures, presumabely because the same rules for signatures apply to PO boxes as any other address type, commercial or residential.
