    Reading on the USPS site, I noticed a small bar down at the bottom that read FOIA. For those who don't know, FOIA stands for Freedom of Information Request, which basically means you can file a petition with the government to release previously classified documents etc as long as they do not pose an immediate threat to national security.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This brings me to my point:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS dictates that all its records are basically open to FOIA requests. A list of flagged addresses must be a database of theirs. Could someone simply file an FOIA request for a list of flagged addresses due to suspected relation to narcotics?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be audacious, but it technically does fall under a valid request for a FOIA.

    You can also use the FOIA to apply for your own file(s) from other Federal law enforcement agencies..The perspective organization is compelled by law to release all of the documents relating to oneself; although they can be redacted if they conflict with any investigation or disclose information relating to one.

    And if they write back saying they don't have any files on you, then you can be sure that tomorrow they will start one.

    There is already a file for everyone; don't be naive.But I do agree, that the act could raise a red flag of sorts.
