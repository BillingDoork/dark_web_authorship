    Do you think they would search and seize your computer? And even if they scrutinized your HDD would there be any remnant of TOR being used to connect to silkroad or would they have no proof other than the fact that you have TOR installed?

    If you had a CD and didn't sign who knows what might happen, they may go away and come back later or they may just come in with the search warrant they already had in preparation for you taking delivery of the order. And you should always assume your computer will be seized and searched and take the appropriate precautions so that it will stand up to a forensic examination.

    can range from ending the investigation to them Bouncing  in anyways kicking your baby. depends on a lot of different factors, eg the amount (big factor)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    obviously you are better off spotting the CD and refusing to sign it. But you can prepare things in advance, aka how you refuse the CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if this is a general question, it can not be answered. if its a specific question, you need to be ... well... more specific.

    Depending on the jurisdiction, my understanding is that a CD already involves a signed search warrant. I'd suspect that LE are coming in to search, signature or not. Protect yourself accordingly, and stay safe!

    This is an interesting, I'm assuming real-life case out of Illinois....read it as it provides some insight into CDs
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://www.expertlaw.com/forums/showthread.php?t=158277
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is the rundown for those not wanting to read it (its a short read):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (1) A package from China was sent to Illinois resident (me) containing anabolic steroid powder (raw powder used to manufacturer finished steroid products).
    <br/>
    (2) A warrant was issued. Here is the condition issued by the judge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "The parcel addressed to (My name, address, apartment #, town,IL,USA) bearing the postal tracking number (tracking#), is delivered by a law enforcement agent and accepted by an occupant of said residence and brought into said residence."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (3) On Thursday afternoon, I left my class at a university. When I came home I had seen a USPS delivery truck leave my apartment complex.
    <br/>
    (4) After I entered my apartment building the USPS driver came back to my apartment and asked if I was going to #XXX(apt number). I said yes. He said he had a delivery for me.
    <br/>
    (5) He handed me the package and asked me to sign for it.
    <br/>
    (6) The package had no tracking information on it, not addressed to anyone, and no postage on it. (The USPS driver is a cop, they repacked the box or covered the original package in brown tape).
    <br/>
    (7) There was one sheet of paper on the outside of the package in a plastic slip, I took the paper out and it said "Fiona" on it.
    <br/>
    (8) I told him I did not know what it was, I did not know who it was from, I didn't want mail that wasn't for me.
    <br/>
    (9) He looked at the paper and said it was from Fiona, and pushed me to sign for the package again.
    <br/>
    (10) I looked at the box again and said sorry you can send it back it is not for me, I'm expecting a knock off Movado watch but it had a different tracking number (This is true).
    <br/>
    (11) He said they will only hold onto it for a day then send it off to a warehouse. I said that it fine you can send it back.
    <br/>
    (12) I kept a pink card that they normally leave when you are not home and it had the tracking number on it.
    <br/>
    (13) The next morning I stopped by the post office and gave them the card with the tracking number. He asked me if I figured out what the package was, I said "No, I am expecting I watch and I wanted to see if maybe the tracking number had changed and if this was the package".
    <br/>
    (14) He said it was on the delivery truck already. I said okay Ill be in school all day.
    <br/>
    (15) I picked my girlfriend up and we got to my apartment around 1030am (SHE DOES NOT LIVE WITH ME, she has her own place around 1hr away from me).
    <br/>
    (16) I left for school at 1230pm
    <br/>
    (17) Police deliver the package to her at 1245pm, she signs for it, does not open it, and leaves it at my front door (inside it) and goes back to the TV.
    <br/>
    (18) Police execute a search warrant at 1250pm
    <br/>
    (19) I am in an engineering lab at school. I leave the lab at about 230pm and some college detectives are waiting outside my class. I walk with them to the parking lot and the cuff me and escort me to the townships police department for questioning.
    <br/>
    (20) They try to get me to confess to ordering the package, telling me im pinning it all on my girlfriend.
    <br/>
    (21) I requested an attorney 3 times and from the moment I sat down. They never stopped asking questions.
    <br/>
    (22) I was charged with 3 felony accounts of possession, 3 felony account of delivery within 1000ft of a church, 3 felony accounts of delivery within 1000 feet of a school.
    <br/>
    (23) I was in jail for 5 days before I came up with the $25,000 bond.
    <br/>
    (24) My attorney filed for a discovery motion of course, after 2 weeks the police got back to him. They said they received information I intended to receiver the package, and executed a search warrant. After executing the search warrant they found reason to believe I intended to sell/manufacturer steroids.
    <br/>
    (25) All of the possession charges where changed to Criminal Trafficking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this guy is telling the truth, not only was it not necessary for him to accept the package, he never even had to be at his residence at the same time his package was at his residence to be arrested for it....that's pretty serious.

    Well... Ms. Perez didn't sign. Holding a baby is always a good excuse. No one wants to take the baby.
    <br/>
    The dog didn't even sign.
    <br/>
    The babysitter, or whoever moved the package, didn't sign.
    <br/>
    Yet...

    [sorry to self cite]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are too many of these to count.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Doesn't matter much if you refuse to sign, it appears. Did someone accept/control the parcel? [without even getting into opening it, beacons, etc...]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What Karensupreme and SSBD wrote sums it up nicely. +1s galore. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @zzydwx3 - They aren't searching willy-nilly until the parcel is thoroughly yours or unless other conditions are met... with weird time-delay exemptions aside. Go to the index or search page - do not just search from the search box - and look for "anticipatory warrant" as a good place to start.
    <br/>
    But they're going to lean hard to get one or more of those conditions met.

    The fact that you were identified as a candidate for a CD means your source was comprised, you've been flagged at that address, etc..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should they put the effort into doing a CD - you will get a visit with a permit to search the premise
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact you do not sign at point of delivery does not provide your get out of jail free card
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be safe - do not F/E or sign for a package and prepare for the worst case scenario &amp; always say not a word other than I'd like a lawyer
