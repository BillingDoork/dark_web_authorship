    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am relatively new to SR and hopefully all goes well but I have a question on shipping,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it okay to use my real name and address to buy weed? The packaging is ensured to be very risk-free but the SR Buyer's guide states I should use a PO Box or an address where the goods wont be kept for long (and frankly its much of a hassle for me). Do many people ship to their home addresses?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I live in Australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.
    <br/>

    Most people will recommend that you use your real name and address.

    Shipping to your home address is ok. I think a great majority of SR users do it.

    There are many threads on here that discuss this to death, please do some research before starting a new thread, it's just lazy not too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Opinion is split, personally I would not use my real name for anything, others will tell you otherwise. Do some research and make your own mind up, if you are ordering domestically there are several good domestic vendors that you can use hassle free with good stealth, all the info is on here if you take the time to look. good luck!

     in some cases, this method can backfire on you.  and your vendor will likely not be offering you a refund if your package doesn't make it and they know you're using fake info (even just a fake name).

    Maybe, but am I willing to take that risk. I just don't want to put my real name on an envelope with illegal drugs  ;D
