    Malaysian customs are a joke though. They're mostly looking out for ways to get bribe money from hapless importers of goods. They don't run dogs and I have no faith in their technology, but it can get pretty dangerous and risky because of the penalty. I think if you just went with an extreme stealth vendor you could get stuff in. What are you interested in buying?

    There has been one confirmed weed ship to Malaysia, but best advice is not to try it because weed is quite smelly, especially the stronger strains that everyone wants. I've smoked some weed in Malaysia before, and I agree it's pretty shitty compared to international stuff. Compressed with seeds and sticks and all that jazz. Still, it's pretty cheap there isn't it? International stuff will be 2-3 times more expensive if I have my numbers right. You might be better off sourcing for local hash or just go into other drugs :D

    Yes, even through 10 layers of vacuum sealing there will be particles that leak out. The number of particles that does increases as time goes by. Add in heat from international flights (cargo bay has no air conditioning) and the speed of international deliveries (&gt;10 days) and you may have problems with the package. Since Malaysia is a muslim country though I'm not sure if they have dogs checking out inconspicuous mail, or if they have particle scanners. If you have any information about that, I'm sure the other walkers will like to know.

    If you do try to order it and it comes through, let people know on the forums!

    Importing weed of all drugs into a country with some of the strictest drugs laws on the planet just seems like a really bad fucking idea if you ask me, seriously you can source weed locally can you not? there must be some growers who sell half decent stuff. There is a thread on here re some guys who got hold of a drug detection dog and they ran all sorts of tests with different packaging techniques and one of the posts above is right, permeation will eventually happen no matter how many vac seal layers you use.

    If you do decide to give this a go you will want to make sure you have a totally safe drop address arrangement with no links to you or people who know you because if it goes bad I would not want to be on the receiving end of the Malaysian justice system.

    Just google 'Anwar Ibrahim' if you're unsure of what the Malaysian 'justice' system is like.  ::)
