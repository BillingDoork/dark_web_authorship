    First off, call me an idiot or whatever you'd like. Was shipping to my friend, he said he didn't want to use his real name. He also said that he wanted to ship registered mail. Which was completely fine until now, we tracked the package to his PO box. When he tried to pick it up, however, they told him he needed an ID in the name on the package.   ::)  I know, call me a fucktard. In my defense, I've never shipped registered mail in my life and vendor didn't mention on his page. Still my fault.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We are going to try a few things. One, say he lost his wallet and his new ID is still on the way. I'm also going to see since I have the tracking # if I can change the pickup name or something online. And finally, he's under 21 anyway so I may just get him a Fake in that name here on the road. Problem solved, but if I can avoid paying $175 for a license I will.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any suggestions on how to get out of this shithole I've put myself in? Will give any good suggestions +1 and a big hug!

    If they deliver it to a home then they accept the signature of whoever answers the door.  Usually they ask for ID to verify your address.  I suppose a PO box is a unique situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They'll likely accept any form of identification with the fake name.  I once picked something up and by mistake had a nametag of sorts on from an event earlier in the day.  The person said, "I see that you are John Smith" and therefore they didn't ask for my ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Logically if his ID proves that he is the owner of the PO box then it seems like that should be good enough but different PO employees may have different opinions on that.

    Legally when you open a PO bos you have to put down anybody's information that will be using that box.  http://about.usps.com/forms/ps1093.pdf
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They legally aren't allowed to give you the package.
