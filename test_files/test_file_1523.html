    I Recently Saw A Sign On A Usps Mail Drop Box That Read, "Due To Security Concerns, Packages Weighing Over One Pound May Not Be Left In The Drop Box. Packages Over One Pound Must Be Handed To The Clerk."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is That Because It Was In A Grocery Store? Or Is That Usps Policy? Are Mail Drop BoxesSafe Or Do They Raise Suspicion? Must I Mail All Packages In Person?

    There is a 13 ounce rule on packages going in the blue boxes. I believe the exception to this is flatrate priority boxes. I don't think it matters with how much it weighs with the flat rates as long as it doesn't weigh crazy heavy like a lead brick.

    Stamps aren't suspicious. Yes, you want to have exact postage. Over a couple of cents won't matter if the price of the stamp causes this. You don't won't under paid postage. People use these all time, although they do stand out more than printed postage. You need to weigh which is better for security. I personally would choose stamps over printage postage because of the online record of addresses that comes along with printage postagage among other sketchy security concerns.

    With flat rate weighing isn't needed, but right you can't drop it in a blue box if it is over 13 ounces and paid with stamps, that has been the rule for many years, like since 2007. Right get the proper stamp for the package, it looks terrible when there are tons of first class stamps on the box. Sometimes the exact right stamp isn't available so in that case maybe one $5.40 stamp and then another smaller value stamp to make up the difference. Just make sure you get the right amount of postage; it's easy with the online calculator. Not enough postage is bad of course, but so is too much postage.

    If it bears stamps and weighs over 13 ounces, then it must be taken to the counter, whether it's Priority Mail flat rate or any other class.

    Is It Better To PreStamp And Bring To The Counter or To Pay At The Counter And Have Them Stamp It?

    Are There No Safe Ways To Drop A Package In The Blue Box That Weighs Over 13 Oz?
