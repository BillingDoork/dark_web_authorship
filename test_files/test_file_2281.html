    So I'm in the process of becoming a vendor (getting everything ready! So excited!) and I've been doing my research. Ordering stuff with a separate account, analyzing various shipping styles, doing my homework on shipping costs, order supplies, etc. But then I came across this auction.

    <br/>
    "Secrets of a Discreet Packaging Ninja Revealed!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It claims (with comments to back it up) that it contains several vital tips and tricks to help avoid common mistakes and increase profit. I'm sure that despite my extensive two months of research and planning I am probably over looking SOMETHING here, but I am also cutting close on starter funds if I want to meet my launch deadline of Oct 1st.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess, what I'm asking is for a lil more indepth review of the product from people who have used it or a success story from a vendor who did it all themselves. How hard is it starting your vendor career? Because the closer I get to my start date the more anxious I am becoming and I just want to make sure I'm going to be able to offer my people 110% awesome with my service!

    I just have one concern regarding shipping. If the seller is personally walking into a post office... and mailing many packages out, even if they are at different post offices, if there develops a pattern of interceptions which you may not know about as they continue to let them through..they can easily identify the person constantly mailing packages out paying cash... despite all the security through proxies and tor and bitcoins... actually sending the packages out seems to be the weak point in this link.... unless you have multiple people mailing your packages out for you who would never snitch to police if raided...

    any insight into the problem of mailing out substances.... i know from news reports even highly experienced sellers on private sites have been arrested as law enforcement eventually tracked down who was sending the packages...it seems the only reasonably safe way is to mail it out through letterpost .. i dont see any safe way to go into a post office and send out the things that are sold on SR...they have your picture, and they can follow you without you ever knowing and the sellers are always caught red handed when the police knock down the door.... it seems like mailing packages like this one is just hoping that they will not be arrested before they have made what they want to make and quit

    I've been reading the forums for a bit but I didn't see anything relating to this particular guide. Though I did find out some other great info, like the post from the person who had access to a police dog so they could test how packaging methods held up. That was a pretty great read.

    This was my main concern as well. As far as I am aware though, you can buy flat rate boxes/envelopes and then drop them at any USPS box. I haven't done a mail test yet (this comes next week) so we'll see.

     Flat rate boxes under 13 ozs can be dropped in any box they fit into, but if they are over 13 ozs they need to be taken to the counter or you risk the package being returned to sender.

    It's a valuable guide if you haven't ever shipped for a living before. Sure, there are more advanced methods than it contains, but I'd buy it just to make sure you aren't making a dumb mistake as a newbie.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My #1 piece of advice is to never get complacent and/or lazy with your packaging. Keep changing things up just in case they're watching.

    That has occurred to me as well. The option of exploiting fall guys seems worthwhile. Craigslist errand runners you could meet a few hours drive from your home would be ideal. Even have them text you DCNs to a throw away cell after you make an excuse why you can't meet them again for that day. If a package was then intercepted, with any luck at all, the fall guy would already have his/her fingerprints in the system and become the target of the time wasting investigation themselves.
