    Is there an added risk of ordering from a NL based vendor, rather than from another country in the EU? I heard something like customs are always more suspicious of packages coming from the Netherlands?

    I only order my rolls from Dutch vendors, Never had a problem and some of them have the best packaging I've ever seen. Granted I usually only place small orders for personal use,But still I have had really good luck with NL.

    Never had anything lost or seized, I don't order everyday. To me it's worth it I will never buy Rolls,MDMA or Molly that isn't 100% Dutch sourced. The quality is that good and the risk is worth the reward.

    If you really want to be secure, buy from the highest rated vendor and see if there's an option for extra safe packaging..
    <br/>
    Always good to check forum/feedback to see if anyone has had their mail confiscated :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd happily check it for you, although SR is giving me a hard time accessing it at the moment :P

    Best would be a NL source that ships from Germany, I thought I saw some vendor doing that?
    <br/>
    If I would start selling my herb on SR I would do that too, the German border is just 25-50km away, as a vendor that would seem worth the time.

    That sounds like a really good idea, Because Germany is practically and extension of the U.S. with all American Military stationed there and the base.Do you think it's possible to get on a American military base in Germany and ship from there? Because military mail is processed as domestic mail in the U.S. I think it actually bypasses customs.

    Looked at info on Wikipedia and it seems the US bases are more in South of Germany, that 25-50km is just getting a bit into East of Germany and shipping from a mailbox.
    <br/>
    It would seem weird if someone could just ship "domestic" from an US base as someone that's not in the US Military/German military/US citizen, don't think that would be easy.

    I don't think it would be easier either without a German or American Soldier going with you, Like a friend or something. Then again I order most of all my Rolls from Dutch vendors and have never had a single seizure. I'm sure Germany is much safer as well. Considering the large American population in Germany that ships mail and packages back to friends and family in America.

    As long you stay away from shady vendors everything will be (in 99.99% of all cases) alright.

    I did loads of research on this topic before my first order, and I couldn't find any evidence to suggest that smaller orders were any less likely to arrive from NL as from anywhere else. Since then I've received plenty of good stuff from there without any problems :) It may be a bit different with larger parcels, IDK.

    I have never ordered anything large from a NL vendor, But provided you go with a reputable seller I don't see any reason the order wouldn't make it. So far the NL sellers I have ordered from have some excellent packaging.

    Packaging goes a long way, So far every Dutch vendor I have gone through has excellent packaging.
