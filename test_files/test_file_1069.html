    So I have a Kilo of Methylone on the way. The first page of tracking says its currently being reviewed by NYC customs, however when you click to the second page it says "Origin post is preparing shipment." I've gathered that that means they have the package in a shipping container and are waiting to get it filled up to send it here. (I live a few states away). But I do not believe that in the past seven days NYC usps has been unable to fill up a single shipping container headed to my state. I'm getting scared here guys.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are these tell tale signs of a CD about to happen? Why would it take so long. The last Kilo I ordered came in a week. This one has been in customs for a week.

    I've had a kilo of MDMA sit in NYC Customs for exactly 23 days.  It's a crap shoot with the mail system as always, if you took all necessary precautions on designating your drop you should be okay.  Be sure to let the package cool off for maybe a week.

    What do you mean designating the drop?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The address is clean of all illegal stuff, and its actually going to a location where the main office clerk will sign for it. So if a "post man" goes to the actual door of the recipient we will know its a CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plan is to take a black sharpie and write return to sender and leave it by the front door for 24 hours. Hopefully if there is a GPS tracker in it LEO will grow impatient!

    If it's been in customs that long write it off, I doubt it's coming. Your supplier is probably Chinese right? Probably packaged it wrong and forgot to give a fuck. It's the Chinese way. :)

    Supplier is DR. Gonzo. And yea Chinese..... I actually did look into EMP devices, and they don't have small ones. The only way they know how to do it is with atom bombs and shit. At least thats what the government want the public to believe. If they had small ones that would be awesome to cut off police from using their radio.....among other things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, that one dude said that his Kilo was in customs for 23 days. I hope thats what happens to mine. I hope they send a love letter or update the tracking so I can get a re-ship. Is it bad that Ive been checking the tracking on clearnet? (And no the package is not coming to my house)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You guys think that address is flagged? I'm running low on good addresses.

    Make sure not to talk around it because I've heard that they put recording devices in the package. Some people got busted in Australia not to long ago and there package had a listening device in it.

    For your own sake, I suggest you don't pursue the EMP idea.  1KG of methylone is a hefty importing/distribution charge, but that isn't much compared to the anti-terrorism charges they can use if you are caught with an EMP device, regardless of size.

    This.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This may sound condescending to the OP but you don't have to come up with any elaborate "Doctor Octopus Bad Mother Fucker" ideas to be a crim and keep safe. Instead of looking for things you could get either at an Military Base or a nationally funded research development facility which you'd have to do some Ocean 11 style shit to get into which would take years why not spend 5 minutes on Google and buy a bug detection device which you can just wave around in the vicinity of any package and if it beeps get take it back to the post office!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You need to be realistic kid, you are importing a brick of bk-MDMA which costs in the region of $600-800 to make which you'll probably make at the outside $25K if you sold it g-for-g and you are talking about getting stuff used in comic books and by the Military? And such equipment would cost at least 10-20x the value of the production cost of what you are bringing in? Get real. What you really need to be focusing on is finding a supplier (for yourself preferably) that actually knows how to get the shit ya buyin' and potentially supplyin' past customs and into your hands. So instead of this kid-shit about EMP devices and joining the Avengers you need to be asking yourself the following questions -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Has, to the best of Dr Gonzo's knowledge, Chinese supplier had any issues with customs previously?
    <br/>
    2. If the answer to question one is "Yes" what did they do to rectify this situation?
    <br/>
    3. If the answer to question two given by the supplier is "Oh yes we change packaging long time, we very good, you fuck old lady" the answer to question two is that, as per the norm, they did fuck all to change because, as per the norm, the Chinese don't give a fuck.
    <br/>
    4. If they give you a credible answer to question two and they give detailed descriptions of how they get it past customs make sure that their solution is actually a valid one because a lot of the time when the Chinese think they have a solution although they will have tried their best they will still balls it up (unintentionally yes, but that still doesn't get you your shit).
    <br/>
    5. What can you do to facilitate a smoother and quicker passage from dispatch to delivery because whether you like it or not a lot of the time that shit is on YOU.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is why people middle-manning from the Chinese is often such a balls-up because Mr Yin doesn't appreciate the intricate complexities and reasons why DEA, FBI, SOCA, Customs or whoever the fuck ever doesn't want you to receive your shit through the mail. What he is bothered about is making sure the Chinese officials pass it because then he wont get shot for drug manufacturing and trafficking and making sure the latter don't clock the package does not mean it negates the chances of the former.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are going to order from the Chinese you either need to do it yourself or have someone break this shit down for you and run through address procedure with you etc because it prevents problems like this from happening and me having to explain them at 3.41am on a Wednesday morning.

    Yea that was extremely condescending. For one I did not look into EMP devices because of this package. I'm a bit of a gadget guy and researched that a while ago more on the curiosity side just cause I was wondering. I was never actually going to buy one. And if you researched that at all you would find that not even an option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I sold it 600 bucks an ounce that would net 18,000 profit. If I grammed it up it would be a lot higher.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for finding a supplier Gonzo seems to be the go to guy for bulk M1. I did get a Kilo from Googleyed before. That came in 4 days from china. Part of why this here has me worried. The only vendor I've met that openly talked about having issues with customs is CanadianForger, and I also have an order from him coming to a different address.

     "If you are going to order from the Chinese you either need to do it yourself or have someone break this shit down for you and run through address procedure with you etc because it prevents problems like this from happening and me having to explain them at 3.41am on a Wednesday morning."

    Need to do it myself? Thats......exactly what I did. Thats exactly the reason I have a package in customs isn't it? And how can I prevent problems like this from happening? If anything at all is wrong it would be because of the vendor, and if you look at his feed back there is no indication he is a bad vendor at all. Or has bad packaging. I did my homework. Its out of my hands. The address procedure is down. Place is clean and the main office will sign for it. So the recipient knows that if the post man comes to his door and not to the main office of the complex its a CD and not to sign. Simple.

    I was only asking what other people thought of this situation. Thanks for voicing your opinion.

    Ok admittedly that came across as a bit full on but my point is that if you're going to be ordering bricks from China there are specific things you need to be doing to ensure the package gets through that aren't "out of your hands" so long as you address them during the negotiations before proceeding with the transaction.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also my $600 figure was the cost of production not the cost on an ounce. My point is that it's worth very little and you don't need to spend staggering amounts on gadgets that can get you F U C K E D by the government to push up the % of a successful transit period.

    If you want to discuss this further PM me, it's not really prudent to be throwing around info on a public forum.

    Wow that sucks, I hope you took all the necessary precautions mate so this doesn't fuck you over. I cant really give you any advice besides not giving out more specific details, because this thread is riddled with em. Like Limetless says, it would be so much better to take this to PM :)

    I haven't read the thread but I just wanted to let you know that even legal thing can get stuck in customs too. I've had it happen several times. I had a pair of headphones from the UK get stuck in NYC customs for 3 weeks. It finally got delivered to me after a month. That was the worst one, so don't give up on it yet.  ;D

    Yes this is true but M1 is neither legal nor just an importation duty issue lol. It's a drug and don't want to lose your investment or get bent over and fucked by Big Henry in the showers because your soft skin reminds him of when Mama used to tuck him in at night and thus he must show his affection by tucking you in with his 10" baby-arm cock lol...

    Um if your ordering m1 250g+ from china yes u will be getting c.d's lately it has happened to a couple people i know as of lately and especially if your supplier is sending to the West coast i didnt think they started catching on to east coast yet but im not suprised Dr. Gonzo is a good vendor but all he is doing is middle maning you guys so he really doesnt even know how its going to be packaged and knowing his source and chinese labs lol lim is right they dont give a fuck your best bet is to start ordering unscheduled chems or find a u.k supplier that knows how to package these cathinones that homeland security is on the hunt for lately because they put all these cathinones in the " Bath Salt" category so now in usa if u take bath salts u eat peoples face off according to them so they are on the hunt for this shit.
    <br/>
    O and one more tip if you still do decide to order from China dont order from the beijing, shanghai, especially NAINJING region those regions in that area are watched at customs have ur supplier ship closer from hong kong

    Exactly. Whether you think I am being harsh or not OP you have to understand your real value and your orders value to these Chinese suppliers. 1KG means nothing to them because they work on numbers and the balance of probability because they have people lined up round the door to fill your place and the stuff is so cheap to make 1KG lost is like shooting a Mammoth with a pellet gun. Even if they reship that order to you because of the amounts they make at a time they will still be in their whack and if they don't reship it it doesn't matter because someone else will come along to take your place like I said. If you are going to order from the Chinese you need to make sure your middle-man actually knows how to get the Chinese to arrange the stuff to be packaged properly AND FOR THEM TO BE SURE THEY HAVE or you need to go direct to them yourself so you can tell them exactly how you want it done to fit your specific needs and circumstances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also consider this - The "middle-manning" business structure suits the Chinese down to a tee because it basically allows them to max out their potential client base. Your average vendor (in this case Dr Gonzo) is highly unlikely to disclose whom his sources are is he? Nope because that's not the drug-dealer way. What that means is that middle-manning allows them to shield themselves against the issues that you OP have fallen into because even if you par off Dr Gonzo you can probably still find these guys on the internet yourself. So as this is the case, collectively they can get two chances instead of just one. It means that their mistakes mean even less because eventually when you get more confidence you may find them and order from them again without knowing. Takes away the need for them to improve their practices because you can be damn sure they don't give a shit if the DEA come knocking..
