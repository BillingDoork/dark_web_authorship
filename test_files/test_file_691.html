    I am unsure if this has been posted before (if it is sorry and I will delete this post)

    Looks like no Sat Mail anymore for USPS after Aug 5th
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The U.S. Postal Service plans to stop delivering and collecting letters and other first-class mail on Saturdays beginning Aug. 5, although packages will continue to be delivered.

    This is the skinny. Parcels apparently 8) will still be delivered on Saturdays. "But the USPS will still deliver parcels six days a week, a service that has grown by 14% since 2010." Funny they give a nod to ebay and amazon for this growth. I'd wager SR has been very good for the USPS business and I'd also wager an SR shutdown would be a disaster for the USPS. Any thoughts or opinions? Is SR actually good for the economy?

    The deliveries that SR procures for the USPS are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things, and they're paying individuals to prevent the deliveries of what we buy here, so I'd say the answer is no-we don't do much good or bad for the USPS

    USPS is up the creek without a paddle right now. Nobody is helping them.

    So..packages are still going to be delivered...to both p.o. boxes and to actual houses/apartments?
    <br/>
    What if I have a couple bills and a package? Are they going to pick and choose what they're going to deliver?

    I was talking with a colleague earlier today about the USPS and how the government makes them do things that they make NO other organization in the history of the United States to do giving its citizens the impression that the USPS is not handling it's job. I have family on the inside. It is complete smoke and mirrors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason the USPS is so heavily leveraged is that Congress has the USPS pay for benefits 75 YEARS IN ADVANCE and their union is strong as titanium! That explains all the unnecessary bloating.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is a complete government mind f*ck to the citizens.

    You are right, SR makes no dent. Let's be honest, though. If everyone that sends or receives illicits via USPS domestically, stopped. It would be a line item on USPS's Excel spreadsheet that would be very hard to ignore. Trust me.

    America is synonymous with clandestine. You can't have the market we have without a thriving black market. Just doesn't work one way and not the other.
