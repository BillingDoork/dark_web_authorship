    Just wanna test the waters here, with the idea of putting a fund together whereby a venerable vendor in NL would 'contaminate' hundreds of parcels and letters with drug residue, to basically 'Zerg' AUS customs; I would be ready to contribute to said fund if it was to arise.........FOR THE LULZ!!

    I'dunno about contaminating for the lulz, but making a list of government worker's home addresses especially those in higher positions, and then carrying this out would be far superior :D

    Although I like the idea for fucking with the officials, this is the surest way to divert more resources to intercepting packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I don't live in Aus so I'd definitely chip into this pooled fund! Ship em half grams of heroin and coke and some odd research chemicals.

    That's a pretty clever idea, not sure what would happen but it'd be interesting to observe.

    It's no different to the old 'spray bong water the night before a big festival' idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My thought is, why piss them off even more? Why bring more heat? Why 'demand' they throw more resources at it? Why poke the bear even more?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if you're going to do it, why warn them by posting it here?
