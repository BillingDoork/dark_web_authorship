    Hello
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone have experience of Royal Mail opening packages that are incorrectly addressed on the same day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I believe the process is that if mail is refused with the incorrect name then it should go to a dedicated centre in Belfast where it is processed and opened as a last resort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone heard of the mail actually being opened (I assume at the local depot) on the same day.

    Nope, it won't happen. If it has the wrong name and is refused then it will be returned to sender, only if there's no return address will it go to Belfast. It will never be opened at a local office, and certainly never the same day.

    It would only be opened by a thieving temp postie, you mean!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yeah, PP is right, RM won't open anything at a post office.

    it's cool now, had a story about the postman asking for an incorrect name then turning up later in the evening to say the police had intercepted the package and to expect a visit and could I have my money back :-)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Luckily for all the package then turned up the next day so we're all good and things ended happily.

    Thanks for the replies though.
