    This is a post that is going to outline my shipping mishap and attempt to gauge the opinions and suggestions from the users of this forum.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor that this incident occurred with is a vendor whom I've dealt with for my entirety of  using this site. I was buying from him before he even began using this site and that would require me to send him cash in advance and trust that he would ship it to me. This all worked fine for about 2-3 months until he took a break and I moved on to another vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just recently this vendor decided to come back onto the SR and attempt at selling. Well I ordered my usually 4 oz order, waited patiently and eagerly for my mail to arrive and was finally rewarded by 3 packages in the mail. I typically DON'T open my packages from vendors that I TRUST because I have come to feel comfortable that the amount that they ship is the amount that I paid for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I get my packages and I open one (of three) packages to weigh out a personal oz and ended up selling the rest all at once. Everything was fine until I get a message from this vendor saying "I think I accidentally shipped you 3 packages". At first I didn't understand what he was saying, until he asked me to send him another 400 dollars "150 off the regular price". Supposedly.. he sent me 2 extra oz and was asking me to pay him for it. If I had caught that he had sent me an extra 2 oz and I had managed to profit off of it, I would have gladly sent him the extra 400 for the extra amount.. but I didn't.. nor was I even remotely aware that he had sent me extra (Why would I expect something like that to happen, after all the time I've dealt with him, I've neither been short nor fat).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So initially I ask the person who happened to purchase the product if it weighed out more, well he offered me this reply " I didn't weigh it out man, I trusted you and sold it as described". I know this kid wasn't lying but, that means he moved this weight also without weighing it too.. AWESOME. And to top it off.. he told me he sold to sketchy trailer trash.. and they were adamant about it being the right weight. (these kids were most likely lying but there was no way I was getting the cash from these hoods).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now this vendor has seemingly thrown a fit and completely quit selling on SR saying that I scammed him and now I am untrustworthy. I suppose he expects me to pay him 400 dollars for his mistake but
    <br/>
    I just can't see how I'm 100% responsible for this and I want to hear what you guys have to say.

    If I fucked up on the job, I wouldn't expect others to fix it. The fact that this vendor made a mistake and won't take responsibility shows just what kind of person he/she is. Step up or step out. Sounds like they are stepping out. Their choice, you did nothing wrong IMHO.

    I would probably let it go if I realized I had given more. Thats like serving a stake to a guy, and then saying 'oops, looks like I served you 250g instead of 150g. That`ll be $25 extra.' OP is this is accurate, then you are not at fault. You should not feel bad about it at all.

    This isn't Walmart this is the dope game. Here is how shit works. If I give you a bag then you can weight it test it fuck it do whatever you want with it while I am still in your presence. But once you take the bag its yours forever no matter what the issue is. With that being said, if I give you a bag thats over, its yours if you take it period. I have had a person give me 7 grams of coke too much in an OZ bag before. This was my first experience with a situation like yours. Now this is what happened, this guy was a powerful person, at least compared to me. When I went back to his house he figured out what he did and he regretted it but he told me keep it. It was his fuck up and in the dope game when you fuck up its on you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tell your connection to stop getting high and making up bags.

    PS - just recently my scale was malfunctioning. I figured out it was wieghing under by around 150mg. Ultimately customers of mine got around a dozen bags that were 150mg heavy. I would never ask for it back, in fact once I found out I was just like yea its a gift. What kind of drug dealer would even attempt to ask for compensation for thier fuck ups.....who knows.......must be a country drug dealer cause that doesnt work in the city lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP - dont worry about this crap. It sounds to me like this guy was lucky that you were a good customer for so long. He has made that 2oz over and over. Consider his fuck up a gift. Also, cut ties with him. There are many good pot connections on SR. I have bought bud from just about everyone and if you need advice here is a list of people that have great bud and are great people to deal with.

    I wonder how high you'd need to be to not only send an order three times, but also to have three bags arrive and not think that it was three times the qty that you ordered.
