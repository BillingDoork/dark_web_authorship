    Hi everyone,
    <br/>
    I received what was supposed to be a re-ship (from Thailand to Australia). The envelope has been cut open along the top with a razor blade.
    <br/>
    The goods are missing but the disguise remains in the envelope. There is no letter from customs to say they seized it. I would like to know
    <br/>
    how common this is In Australia and if it has happened to anyone else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aussie,

    <br/>
    Happens alot, postal workers nearly 100% of the time get away with stealing post (unless tracked, but still likely to be claimed as 'lost').
    <br/>
    What was it, lose much?
