    I ordered ~200 pills, international and it has tracking.
    <br/>
    I got the usps slip telling me they missed me and that i should stop by to pick it up.
    <br/>
    with the slip, i also got my order for half an ounce of mushrooms, so i'm skeptical whether its a CD as they would also search the rest of my mail if it were unless they wouldnt have a warrant just yet as they need my signature.
    <br/>
    should i sign? should i let it go? how should i go about this?
    <br/>
    I am also expecting an international clearnet package from ebay around now too.

    Hey man, chances are your good. It just means you weren't there to accept your shit &amp; the vendor might have sent it requiring a sig.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would message the vendor and ask.

    Oh sweet, do you know anything about how I can assure that even if it turns out to be a controlled delivery, I can get away clean?

    They won't wait days to raid you. More like a few minutes after you get the package.

    You should be fine to sign. A lot of times with international orders even if the sender checks no signature required, the receiving country may require it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets discuss a few things. Now adays it seems they don't even need you to sign for it. If you live in a residential area, they can just put it on your doorstep, and bust in your house a minute after you bring it inside, IF they are watching you. If they were going to get you to sign for it before raiding you, they would do it at your doorstep, and reattampt delivery most likely. They would not allow you to come get it on your own terms and time convienence. LE doesn't work like that. One of the biggest tips for avoiding LE stings is you set the time, place, etc. LE doesn't always have time to sit around all day and wait for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also remember, if you don't seem like a total sketch-ball, there is always a TON of plausible deniability for a lawyer to get the controlled delivery/conspiracy charge dropped in court. They mostly use such deliveries to get inside your house and find other drugs, and charge you with those. Now don't think you still won't get charged for a delivered package... it all comes down to how you play your cards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In your case, I would assume you are fine to get your package.

    Sounds like your normal international delivery attempt. Most parcels from overseas that have tracking require a signature. If you want, instead of picking it up you can sign the back of the peach 3849 slip and check off either "redelivery" at a time you're there or you can request to have it left in your mailbox/at your door by signing for it without seeing it. Anyway you do it, I'm sure everything is fine.

    Just curious where one would leave this slip?
    <br/>
    I imagine just sign it, check the box, and put it back in your mailbox, right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would this work for a PO box too?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The few times I have gotten this slip, I would always just go up to the counter to receive my package.
    <br/>
    I would like to keep from having to do so in the future, if this were to happen again.
