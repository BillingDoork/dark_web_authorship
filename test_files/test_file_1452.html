    So i noticed the sign for this outside a shop in the city i live in while i was out and about, I have done some looking on their website and It seems to be a fairly decent service.. Il copy and paste some info over here, However feel free to check it out by searching for it in the search bar . It also looks as if paying via anonymous visa would work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Apparently you could register as an ebay seller(and a few other types but ebay seller woul give you the excuse for volume), And get the parcels collected from any drop off point(shops,post offices, houses) or a locker.
    <br/>
    Anything up to 2kg is 3 - 4.20 price wise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They have a list of things they will not allow to be sent, although the stealth packaging would probably defeat this. Heres the bit on drugs.
    <br/>
    Drugs
    <br/>
    Prescription or Illegal. Those discovered in transit will be stopped and passed to customs or the police who may take legal action against the sender and/or recipient.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it isnt letting me copy and paste as they have saved it as images, but they have.
    <br/>
    .2 day delivery service.
    <br/>
    .Open early to late to fit around your lifestyle
    <br/>
    .Drop of parcels at selected outlets ( they have a parcel finder) i think this is possibly safer than the mybybox review that was recently about.
    <br/>
    prices start from 3.50+vat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they have "tips on how to send parcels" which may provide valuable info on how to make parcels blend in to their system.
    <br/>
    Listen to this bit about the couriers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "hermes couriers are recruited from within our area, so their local knowledge is second to none, If your customer isnt at home bt works nearby, (or is nearby) Our dedicated courier will be only too happy to make the detour and ensure your customer recieves their parcel as soon as possible.
    <br/>
    We love keeping everyone happy, so so with myhermes it's never neccesary to wait for a delivery, Ask your customer for their SAFE PLACE and and we'l make sure it gets to them , First time. Our guarantee is our free onlin tracking system (comes with every package and availaible to check on tor, not sure about redflags) "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They have over 2000 parcelshops and 9,500 couriers.They claim to remain the cheapest tracked delivery service for above 1kg and medium parcels below 1kg.
    <br/>
    New dedicated contact centre to handle your queries first time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyhow check it out, I know if there is any place to pick apart things itl be this place , I bet we will have it analyzed and yay or nayed within a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All the best roadies, thought i would bring it to your attention :)

    I have had a couple of non-SR deliveries from these clowns and they're comically unreliable. They collected several days late from the merchants I'd bought junk from and then took even longer to deliver it to me. I wouldn't use them for anything I cared about or needed quickly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It will vary massively by location though, the couriers are self employed and don't earn much, so they'll have very differing service standards depending on how lazy they are.

    Yeah that was the one hole i saw in it all as well, probably better sticking with the usual countrys mail system, Just wanted to know as if it was reliable then it could have been a bit more anonymous.
    <br/>
    Thanks for the feedback.

    It's a nice idea though. I don't mind waiting a while for parcels to arrive from SR, it is drugs in the mail after all and it's still better than buying from psycho face to face. If there have been no shows using this service then I don't see the company lasting very long.

    I did get both my deliveries from them, it just took a bit of patience/chasing. So yeah, I'd say it's an option if you're not worried about time.

    Interesting ebcause there may well be a market for improved anonymity for the sender etc in exchange for a bit of a delay.
