    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today I had my first experience with someone using a fake name and a suspicious mailbox to accept packages. The mail obviously did not get there and now 12 pills are floating in limbo.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is unacceptable ordering behavior and I don't think I'm the only one here who thinks that. From what I understand, most vendors feel like its a waste of time and money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This behavior does not warrant a refund of any kind, nor can I afford to, but I don't know how to not give a refund! Every other time I have clicked "never sent" or "never arrived," it automatically credits them back.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do I do this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks everyone.

    Not 100% sure, but I think you'll have to wait until the customer brings the order to the resolution centre. In the meantime, you should contact vendor support and let them know the scenario. ;)

    I had a package this week that wasnt delivered because of a fake name and address.  The DCN said, "undeliverable as addressed" and then another scan a minute later that said "vacant".  As a vendor this is very frusterating, and im sure its frusterating for the buyer who never recives a package they paid for too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buyers please make sure you are using a good address and a name associated with that address.  Send yourself test packages if you are using a fake name or trying to ship to a vancant house, make sure you will be able to accept the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP unfortunatly you have to wait for it to Autofinalize or for the buyer to take the claim to resolution.

    You'll probably have to pay for this one - at least it'll teach you something, though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have any kind of suspicion, don't do business with that person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless you have proof you sent it, if not then you are liable as the vendor.

    Welcome to getting ripped off over the Internet, we've all been there.  :)

    Don't click anything!  Let the idiot that fucked up take it to resolution, then once it's in resolution let SR know that you sent in good faith that they were using a good address with their name, &amp; obviously they chose not to &amp; you will not accept giving any refunds . . . you want your money.  Their bad info is on them, there is nothing you can do when they fuck up address info. . .   end of discussion!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    List it on your page, bogus name = bogus refund if in is not delivered!

    ^^^Right here, what NCK said. Also, take a look at the situations covered in the TOS of some of the senior vendors (on their SR vendor page). Make sure you have a clear and easy to understand TOS on your page to cover things like this. That is a mandatory CYA move. A lot of this shit you just learn from experience, take the hit, learn the lesson and move on.
