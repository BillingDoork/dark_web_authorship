    So I've been reading over quite a bit about the shipping aspect of SR and it seems that the general consensus is not to use a fake name, because that can raise suspicion with the post office who are not use to shipping that name to that address, and that you should NEVER ship to your home address. This makes a lot of sense to keep yourself safe from possible prosecution if the package is intercepted but I have found myself in an interesting situation and I'm wondering if I can break those rules. For the past three years or so my sister and I have both been receiving Amazon packages under a fake name just as a joke between her and I. Clearly this name is not registered to my home address and it seems to be clearly a fake name but all packages have arrived on time with no issue for about three years now. Do you think it would be safe to send a package from SR to my home address under this fake name because the postal service is use to seeing it arrive at my house? Do you think it may just be a fluke because the packages are in Amazon boxing? Should I just ship to a friends house? Thank you for any help you can offer!

    Go for it. Start out with something small. And preferably not illegal just in case it does get seized. then work your way up until you get comfortable ordering what you want.

    Just consider the fact that most of Amazon packages you received were likely delivered by UPS or OnTrac if you are on the west coast

    Who told you this?  If you're in the US it's total BS.

    Give your real name and your real address to all SR vendors.  If you read some more you will eventually find posts about plausible deniability. Anybody can send anything to anybody in the mail. Anything.  There's no stopping anybody who knows us from from sending us a packages that we didn't ask for.  If anything goes down just deny all knowledge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go ahead and use your real name &amp; real address. If a package doesn't get delivered for a bad address and the vendor has a DCN you will be SOL with no refund &amp; no recourse.  Do this enough times and you will likely end up blacklisted. Vendors have their own private forums. If has been posted here that vendors share information about bad buyers.
    <br/>

    Hope this helps  :)

    Hmm alright, that does make getting the package so much easier so that I don't have to get a friend of mine to agree to having it sent to their home. Thanks for your help!

    You're welcome.  And remember the USPS is moving a half billion packages a day.  If you're buying for personal use from a vendor who practices decent stealth or vac sealing the odds of anyone messing with your package are slim to none.  If you're buying weed make sure the vendor double or triple vacs w/ a mylar layer. Always, always, always use PGP.  No exceptions, use PGP. Good luck, be safe, enjoy the Road  :)
