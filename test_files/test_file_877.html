    Alright my fellow druggies..please don't judge me at all from thus post... I've gotten yself into a large bind here... so I've had two packages on their way this week... one arrived today but I don't get things like this shipped to my mailbox normally. (I live in a community where tel he mailboxes are all together... no keys) and I decided to ship these two packages to my actual mailbox this time.. well.. the first one arrived today, and the packaging was horrendous.. you could tell that there was obviously something sketchy about it.. And you could see right through.. anyways.. my landlord ended up finding about this and warned me that he would he inspecting the mail from here on out for suspicious activity.. (I realize this is illegal, but it is his property... And I'm actually getting a hell of a deal living here) my other shipment is estimated to arrive tomorrow.. and he will likely check the mail before I return home from work, Is there anything that I can do... what could I do besides luck out and get the mail first? If he happens to find it and I get interrogated again, what could I say? It is an order of a white crystalline powder by the way... Kind of scared.. Thanks :x(by the way... I only have to make it through tomorrow... because I'm off next week and on weekends.. and I really doubt the package will take longer than that to arrive)

    Failing that, just assert your rights.  If he finds you are recieving drugs, he's obviously not going to be happy.  Regardless of whether or not you are getting a good deal living where you are, it's not worthwhile under any circumstances to compromise security.

    Would you mind sharing the name of the vendor whose packaging is shit? So we can avoid him, also you should mssage the vendor and tell him to improve it.
    <br/>
    If i were you i would start buying a lot of shit from ebay/amazon and annoy your landlord if you get multiple packages and subscribe to shit, he will probably check the first packages, but in the end he will be annoyed and will probably stop.
    <br/>
    I hope you do not get offended, but why dont you order some gay porn or something nasty so he will think twice before opening something again, its his property but its not his name on the package, he shouldnt open shit without your approval.
    <br/>
    And your excuse could be that someone is trying to mess with you and sends you nasty things.

    I would skip out on work... Actually I might try to do something like this... Stake out the mailmans normal route right, sit in your car, well before they make it to your home, flag them down by any means necessary, present them with ID and take your mail rightfully so! They will have no problem giving it to you. I would definitely give this up though or get a different residence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This can also be done while jogging or walking your dog...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guarantee I could personally make above statements work with ease.
