    Why not just use a VPN? Checking tracking should be only done for packages gone MIA anyway.

    Just wanted to see if the vendor actually shipped it this time.... It's been in transit for a week now. And he finally just sent me the Tracking info. And really not too keen on using a VPN, to be honest. I just thought maybe someone from a different state could look up the info for me real quick and see if its been processed and what not...

    why not? you can buy VPN's from oversea's who don't have to abide to anyone, but there lenient gov'ts...and the good ones don't keep any logs. Obviously masks the ip, and so on!
