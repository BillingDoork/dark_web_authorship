    Hey: I had made a domestic (Canada) purchase recently and my item was apparently shipped express the day after I placed the order and it arrived in my town the next day... however, despite reaching my town and being shipped out for delivery  that same day a confirmation of delivery was made by the Post Office (without me signing for or receiving any package). I know this b/c the vendor had a tracking # that I had only checked a week later after non-delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I insisted to the dealer that I had not received anything he referred to the false information provided by Canada Post and when I proceeded to  request a replacement item he became rather angry and basically accused me of being a 'scammer'. Of course, when I called Canada Post they were predictably  useless and unhelpful and said that any inquiry into an Express package would require that the sender 'initiate' the investigation.  FYI: Canada Post provides the shittiest mail service in the world: they have the most lazy and unmotivated staff I have ever seen. What I find utterly puzzling is that this was an Express package WITH TRACKING that disappeared into thin air. How they can insist that the delivery was made without a signature from me is totally beyond me. I suggest that anyone ordering anything from Canada insist that their item require a signature for delivery: otherwise they are risking getting fucked like me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I have been thinking: there were 2 items from the U.S. that I ordered from a reliable vendor which I ordered over 3 weeks ago which also never arrived which leads me to suspect that either there is possibly a thief at the Post Office who is aware of the packages I am receiving (and who also happens to be a drug user) OR if it might have been LE who  intercepted those packages and has me under some kind of surveillance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am wondering if I  should let the Post Office know that I suspect that one of their employees is stealing my mail or if that it is too much of a "heat score". Now I am even unsure about ordering any more items to my mail address thinking that they are going to just get stolen or intercepted anyways.  I am wondering if I should perhaps just get a separate P.O. Box. for any future orders. Any thoughts/observations/advice? Thanks.

    I'm starting to suspect Canada Post too.   I placed an order with Reich back in March.  It never arrived.   It was a very small order (25mg of 3-meo-pcp).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I placed a new order, this time 2g of MXE.      It was shipped May 30 and it still hasn't arrived.    In the meantime several domestic orders arrived safely, also two small samples from Limetless arrived safely (also from the UK, shipped separately one week apart)...

    I had an express package sent to me recently which was no SR related. The tracking was marked as delivered for a couple of days before I decided to investigate. The first person told me to have a look under the bushes outside my house. Yes, THE FUCKING BUSHES. I complained several times, charged back my credit card for the item and then it mysteriously turned up 3wks later. The package should have taken 1 day, so I have no idea wtf happened to it. At a guess, the postie stuck it in the back of his car and decided to deliver it only when I lodged a couple of complaints and demanded the postal service contact the delivery guy directly about the package not turning up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I understand lodging complaints and going into the local post office stomping your feet may not be the wisest idea in your situation though.......

    Well, he could always attempt to have a legitimate package either opened or stolen. Of course, you'd have to mimic the same type of package that you would have received from a vendor. If it doesn't arrive, you can complain without the risk. If it arrives opened, your paranoia may be justified; although you still may not know which of the two suspects are taking your packages.
    <br/>
    (If you can't figure out a way to tell if your package was opened or not, another SR member did something similar: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26420.0)

    MDPV? Bath Salts? Not my thing dude. Ordered 50 mg. of that shit off of a Buy and Sell site once and almost had a fucking stroke. I had actually ordered Heroin: much better for you than MDPV. :)
