     With the goal of making shipping with the U.S. Postal Service® as easy as possible for our customers, we are updating our domestic Priority Mail® and Express Mail® services. As of July 28, 2013, the Postal Service™ will be providing day-specific delivery information for Priority Mail. In addition, domestic Priority Mail will now include, without additional charge, either $50 or $100 insurance for loss, damage, and missing merchandise*. Priority Mail International® will still be available for international shipments.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To simplify the product names, Express Mail will be called Priority Mail Express™. It remains our fastest product available, offering the same great service as Express Mail just with a new name. Express Mail International® will be renamed Priority Mail Express International™.

    Looks like they will also be providing estimated delivery dates on your receipt  if you actually take your package into the post office, but I already check shipping times for my customers and always provide the estimated delivery date which is right 99% of the time since I only ship via priority mail for free.

    Priority mail is already pretty damn good if you ask me. For 5 bucks you get what FedEx and UPS call 2-day air (and charge 3x as much for). People like to hate on the postal service, but they're doing a fine job, especially considering how cheap it is.

    Built in insurance sounds pretty nice, though you probably have to wait an excessive amount of time for USPS to admit something is MIA and pay up.

    Agreed! I'd say about 95% of over 200 orders that I've shipped have arrived within 48 hours from ordering, even to a lot of rural areas. It's rare that it takes 3 days for a priority mail package to arrive unless you order on a Friday/Saturday then it usually arrives on Monday no matter if you ship it Friday or Saturday.

    I'll add another confirmation to this statement: you hear people complain about the postal service all the time, but since finding Silk Road I've truly come to feel it's a reliable, cheap, and substantially under appreciated service.  Bravo, USPS.

    They haven't lost (or technically found, since they all make it) a single one of my dozens of received drug packages, and they're almost always right on time too.  ;D
