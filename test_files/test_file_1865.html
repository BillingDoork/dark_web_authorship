    Read the information below for everything you need to know about shipping and ESTIMATED delivery times for packages sent by MarijuanaIsMyMuse.
    <br/>
    =====================================================================================
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SHIPPING INFO
    <br/>
    =====================================================================================
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On average, over 95% of my packages arrive at their destinations.  If your package doesn't arrive, don't be insulted or angry and please don't attack me or question if I shipped your order.  There will be the rare occasion where your order doesn't arrive.  If that happens, please message me and I will be happy to discuss resolution with you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    =====================================================================================
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Orders are processed, packaged, and sent out within 3 Business Days of being marked in transit (processed).  Tracking information (only available for orders being sent by Tracked Shipping) will be sent out as soon as it is available.  It typically takes about 24 hours for a package to register in the postal system.  If your tracking number isn't working yet, just be patient and check back - it will show up in the system! Tracking is NOT AVAILABLE for any package sent via Standard Post.  DO NOT message me asking for tracking as I will not respond.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    =====================================================================================
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please do not message me with questions like:
    <br/>
    1) Can you pack my order first? - I pack orders in the order they are processed, changing this method does nothing more than slow me down.
    <br/>
    2) What are your thoughts on/What do you think about /What is your success rate in shipping to "COUNTRY/DESTINATION"? – I don’t keep that kind of information so I don’t have any answer for you.
    <br/>
    3) Check the forums – almost all of your questions have been asked before and an answer is almost always available on the forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ====================================================================================
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MAKE SURE to enter your correct address exactly as it should be. We copy/paste the address you provide directly to a mailing label for shipping. If you provide an incorrect address or it is not in the correct format, we will not be responsible for non-delivery of your package and no refund will be provided.  For detailed addressing requirements, read my Buyers Instructions (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32308.0)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    =====================================================================================
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You will receive a message when your order has processed and your package will be shipped shortly thereafter. Larger orders sent in a parcel require additional packaging to ensure security &amp; stealth and will take longer to prepare for shipping. They will be shipped as soon as they are properly prepared and at my earliest convenience. If there is an urgent issue with your order, please be sure to message me right away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    =====================================================================================
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Our recommendation for best delivery success is to stick with small regular quantities and avoid tracked delivery options unless you really need it in a hurry. Once you've made a few purchases, you should have a good idea how long an order takes to arrive once it's placed in transit. From then on, you can plan your orders ahead of time and place an order X number of days before you need it. Our packing blends in with standard business mail, of which there is a lot, and the likelihood of it being discovered is very small. Over 95% of our orders are successfully delivered. The remainder doesn’t show due to possible theft, seizure, invalid address and sometimes just plain bad luck.
    <br/>

    Sorry for the delayed response, I somehow lost track of this thread and haven't been checking recently
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We use Canada Post exclusively for all standard post, Canada Express, US Express, International Express and parcel deliveries anywhere Canada Post ships to. It's the most economical pricing available, compared to private couriers, they can't just open your mail without a warrant like private couriers and we can turn around processed express orders faster than ever before. Additionally, Canada Post deliveries seem to be given far less scrutiny than overnight package deliveries.

    Wow MJ you are a world of information regarding the Postal System its a privilege to get your insight on these issues and I greatly appreciate your input.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One question regarding the above post and them not being able to open Express Packages without a warrant, do you have any information such as links or details on this. I was completely un-aware of this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again thanks a million for your input

    Hi MIMM,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why would someone use:
    <br/>
    Region &amp; Type:  Small INT'L Standard   Cost:  $85.00      Shipping Time: 8-12 Days     Signature Required:  No
    <br/>
    over
    <br/>
    Region &amp; Type:  Medium INT'L Standard   Cost:  $11.00      Shipping Time: 8-12 Days     Signature Required:  No
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ??
    <br/>
    There is a significant price difference
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also in saying then, when i try to place an order i am only given then option for standard or standard tracked, when i would rather one of the two options above, please advise
    <br/>
    <br/>
