    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DW over here. First thing is first, I wanted to say how amazed and shocked I am to see such a safe online marketplace. I have been browsing SR for a few days now, getting to know various aspects of using the actual site and all it's features, specifically it's business practices among other things. There is a sense of integrity and comrarderie amongst most of its users that has been instilled into this online community which will hopefully see it grow and flourish into something much larger than it is now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me give you guys a little synopsis about myself. I have been selling various types of cannabis and other illicits for several years now, based out of Canada. Cannabis, MDMA, MDA, Ketamine, Mushrooms, and other goodies I get from time to time are my main markets. To those asking--&gt; NO, I do not and will not EVER supply anyone with Bath Salts. I think it's quite degrading to both an individual and the human race for one to  become a bewildered nude cannabal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Shipping
    <br/>
    Domestic shipping--&gt; What are the best ways shipping out? Packaging? Methods? ETC. Do you as a vendor have a registered return address? If so, how would you go about this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To what degree is it safe to ship product internationally, specifically to the USA? Do you package the item the same way you would package it domestically?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Encryption
    <br/>
    I see most sellers say that they would like users to 'encrypt' their message when contacting them. They feature what looks to be similar to an HTML code at the bottom for users to input when they contact you. What is the process of using this code? How do I obtain this code? And must I use it when replying to a user?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have created an e-mail address using tormail.org. Is this safe enough? Or must each message still be encrypted when using SR?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. Bitcoins
    <br/>
    - Which sites do you find most efficient when purchasing bitcoins, of course without any trace hence the transaction must be done via cash
    <br/>
    -Where can you find an accurate exchange for bitcoins --&gt; USD or CAD?
    <br/>
    -Do you see Bitcoins becoming a larger, more widely excepted online currency?
    <br/>
    -How much has the Bitcoin fluctuated in the past 2 - 3 years?
    <br/>
    -Do you see the Bitcoin as perhaps, an investment over a long period of time? [Can't help but ask--&gt; I trade currency daily  :)]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know it's a lot, but all input would be more than appreciated. Cheers to all!

    1) Packaging details are confidential, this keeps any particular vendor's (and the community in general) method of concealing contents of a package confidential, and therefore, still useful.  There is a sticky at the top of the shipping thread that outlines shipping practices to aim for and those to avoid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0  Its tough, and Im still learning, but why risk your safety, security, and anonymity?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3)  Bitcoins are extremely volatile and, IMO, should only be purchased on an as-needed basis.  When you are ready for a purchase, buy the BTC needed and then buy your product.  Personally, I like buying money packs from a local business (cash, or course) and using trusted SR vendors (such as BTC Buddy, great guy) to transfer BTC directly to your SR account.  Bitinstant is another route, although this requires you go into a bank for a cash transaction, as opposed to a 7-11.
