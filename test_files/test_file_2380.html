    I need cigs sent to my house but I can't find a vendor that does discrete shipping. I would prefer if it was dropped off to my house without anyone knowing. I need as much as 2 BTC can buy and I need it without people knowing. Can anyone recommend a vendor, or can YOU do this?

    Save your self the trouble, go stand near a liq store, or where ever stores you got around you that sells cigs.   Ask some dudes to buy you a pack.

    Worked 80% of the time when I was 14-17.  If you get rejected and butt hurt, good luck getting a girl friend.
