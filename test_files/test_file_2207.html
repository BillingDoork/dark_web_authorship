     Received package, but "Postage Due"

    The good news is I received the package with my order, but the bad news is that it has "Postage Due" written on it. I have read a few posts the referred to an obscure postal fee, which is charged when a envelope/bub mailer gets stuck and requires hand sorting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I understand most people get a yellow paper that requires them to pick up and pay the postage. How should I handle this?  Do I need to leave a dollar or two in the mailbox for the postman?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for your help.

    I don't think there is any additional charge for hand sorting in the USPS system.  The only thing I could think of is if the sender did not apply adequate postage.  I would go to the post office and pay and talk to the guy about an ebay purchase you had been waiting for.  If it is a trap, then you have some plausible deniability.
    <br/>
    Message your vendor and ask about how much postage they applied to package.

    Thanks for the reply. I actually got the package with my order delivered to my mailbox (it did not appear opened), but it had postage due written on the mailer. I read on USPS that this is done sometimes, instead of the yellow card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is what the old forum post said about the additional charge:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Here's what happened: because of the bumpy shape of the letter it apparently went through the automated USPS machinery to process First Class envelopes and got stuck in the machinery.  It had to be pulled out by hand and processed by hand.  Because of this the letter was given what's called a "non-machinable surcharge."  (Be sure to look that term up) "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I ask again - Should I leave a few buck in the box for the postman, or ignore it?

    Leave a dollar in there and you will be fine. I've had to do it a couple of times because it seems some postal employees classify bubble mailers as package prices and some don't. Or an incompetent vendor using the wrong postage.

    If they left the package then it means they've waived the extra charge. It's more costly to leave a card and store the package until you pay etc so often they'll knock on the door once and try to collect the unpaid postage and if they have no luck then they'll just leave it, that's usually the case over here anyway :)

    They've always left a little yellow envelope taped to the package to collect postage due from me.
