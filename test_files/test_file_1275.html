    Hello all! I've started vending a little over a month ago, have done about 50 orders or so with great results. I've only had one package not make it which I refunded (another guy claimed he received his package, finalized, but then said he thinks his neighbor stole it and then proceeded to leave me bad feedback for it so that might be two, or he/she might be a dumbass), either way I've obtained my 100 rating and have kept it. Although right now I don't have much for sale but Adderall (which seem to have been selling slower since school is out)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been really careful about packaging things up. I wouldn't say I have the MOST stealthy shipping (like you see some vendors putting things in resealed boxes of candy or other products), but it definitely is better than many of the vendors I've ordered from. However, I figure if I sell internationally I can afford to be more stealthy, because things might tend to go for higher prices in different countries, plus it opens me up to more people.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wanted to see what tips were out there for international shipping. There are plenty for domestic shipping, but I am having trouble finding specific information. I am thinking about shipping to Canada, UK (or the EU as a whole), but I realize that each country might be different in respect to customs laws and whatnot so I wanted to see if there were any special precautions I might have to take? I have delivered stuff to Canada and had stuff delivered to me from Canada, and it seems that they have a lot of similar laws when it comes to shipping, so I'm not too worried about that. I am a little more interested in the UK and the EU. Are there any specific EU countries that have very strict laws that make it hard to ship to? I would think Germany would be pretty stringent.

    Right. You should probably remove the CAPITALIZED PART in your quote that talks about packaging methods vendors use. Even if the OP edits hers your highlighted version will still be out there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And HighGirl: I think you'd do better posting in the private vendors forum or doing a little online research instead. I'm assuming you're in the United States, given the places you mention as international. If this is the case, I'd guess you won't have as difficult a time shipping to Europe or Australia as someone from the Netherlands or Mexico or other smaller countries. (Also, why would Germany be more stringent than any other EU country? German drug laws - esp for personal use - are laughable compared those in the United States. )
