    i'm trying to find a drop house using a real estate website.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so far i've physically checked out around 10 different houses (all vacant properties) but each house i've examined has a large "FOR SALE" sign popping out of the ground.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one of the houses doesn't have a "FOR SALE" sign, but has a blue device around the front door's doorknob, and through the front window you can see a prefab empty clean bowl on top of a prefab empty plate on a prefab clean table. next to the bowl and plate is a prefab silverware fork and prefab silverware knife. and also through the window you can see that the kitchen counter is prefab-clean. there's nothing on it except a flower vase.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3 questions:
    <br/>
    ...will the mailman still deliver my package if he sees a "FOR SALE" sign on the front lawn, and an empty house when he peers through the front window?
    <br/>
    ...regarding the one prefab house (no FOR SALE sign), will the mailman still deliver my package if he sees the blue device i mentioned around the front doorknob, and prefab furniture through the front window?
    <br/>
    ...do usps, ups, and fedex all have different policies concerning these issues?

    If the owners of the house have filled out a mail forwarding form with USPS the mail won't even reach that house and will instead be sent to the house they want it fowarded to. So that will not work...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have to make out a plan and said yourself a few pieces of mail to that address first. But even then by the time you get the parcel you really want they could have filled out the forwarding form the day before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would look at other options.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    how often does that happen (owners filling out forwarding forms)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if they've filled out a forwarding form, will a ups or fedex package still be delivered to the original drop house? or will ups and fedex packages also be forwarded?

    Filling out a forwarding form with the postal service will have no effect whatsoever on UPS or Fed Ex, as they are all totally independent of one another. Of course most normal (?) people submit a change of address to the postal service when they move, but the change of address is only for certain people, not just any mail for anyone that comes to the house. Otherwise, if you moved and someone else started living in your house, all their mail would get forwarded to you. Also, I don't know why having a for sale sign in the yard should necessarily keep the mail from getting delivered, as lots of people live in their houses while they're for sale.

    If you're in the USA and ordering from a USA vendor then don't even worry about a drop house, you will likely miss your package or risk getting caught stealing mail and get charged with a felony.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have never even heard of a peice of domestic mail getting intercepted/discovered unless it literally STUNK of whatever the substance is(such as weed or coke) and was incredibly poorely packaged. Most vendors with very good ratings know how to package their shit correctly.... The SR community tends to be very active about vendor/buyer safety in terms of packages getting where they are going. If you are even slightly concerned then ask the vendor what they do to conceal their product, whether it be it's apperance, or it's odor, etc.

    A fake name is a sure way to ensure your package will be lost forever. Many postal carriers will simply return to sender since the name isn't known to live at that address. Vendors will also not be sympathetic when you contact them for a refund/reship because you picked a fake name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do what MissNatural said, use your own home address with a real name.

    Order 4 quarters to different drops .  Reassemble them into ur pound. If 1 gets intercepted u still have 3/4. If ur having trouble finding a drop you aren't ready to ship pounds. The whole cockamamie idea of shipping to a vacant house is not a good idea, can you stand to lose a pound? It will likely get RTS or flagged If it is shipped to a vacant property.

     I need help with ideas to get SR items sent to a place where I can pick up. I don't want anyone at my house snooping around my mail and I cannot get a PO box. Any other options? Maybe a drop house, but how does one find out how  to find one?

     Any help/ideas are greatly appreciated

    If there hasn't been regular mail for a long time and/or the route has a dedicated mailman who may know the house has been vacant and all of a sudden a random package comes to it, its a higher porbability of it not being delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In most residential areas the mailmen are regulars. They drive their route 6 days a week and can easily notice shit out of place.

    The anarchist cookbook is probably going on its 40th anniversary pretty soon, so it is highly outdated. That said, that does not mean you could not extract some useful info that is still relevant today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact is sending to your house is a gamble. No one ordering felony amounts of any illicit substance should be shipping to their home if they value their freedom. We should always be searching for alternatives. However, if anyone has a successful alternative they know of, they would probably not tell anyone. The best ideas are usually the most novel; and those are the ones you come up with yourself.

    honestly man in this situation you are safer using your own home address for the shipment.  for future shipments maybe not so much.  using a fake address is looking for frustration.  or even an address of a vacant home.  even if you do use a drop site or someone to take the package for you, if they get burned, they will flip on you in an instant.  the safest way to ship is to a real name and real address, and in most cases, your real name and real address.  buy into the system man, many other have and have had zero issues.  i have so far placed 62 orders with zero failures.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i would recommend if your going to be receiving pounds of bud create a scenario where you would be receiving larger boxes on a regular basis. Business to business mail is the least scrutinized, and a business would receive boxes on a more regular basis than a regular citizen Otherwise if you have huge boxes coming to a house every week some one is going to say something about it.  envelopes are different than boxes.   create an LLC and rent out a ware house space.  get orders delivered there.  it will take some time and effort but if you want a clean safe way that is a viable option
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck

    RealityCheck: If you have to ask(3x) whether the mailman will deliver mail to a visibly vacant house then you are not mature enough for the work you have set upon. You sound young, dumb, and desperate. (Welcome to SR)

    Just wanted to add: I have an I.P. cam on my front door; it can pan and scan and notify me of movement though that doesn't work when the wind blows some days. I can see all sides of the street, and also when the mailman approaches the box. I don't even have to be home to watch my own mailbox. Perfect setup.
    <br/>
    It works and its a small added measure of mail security when you know what you have shipped on the way.
    <br/>
    On my street I can easily tell when unknown vehicles are parked up and down the street using this I.P. cam. Lucky for me my box is close to the door,
    <br/>
    I am almost positive I am not the only one who does this.
    <br/>
    As for a drop box, I haven't come up with a solution that would work. I'm not going to pin my BS on a relative, I'll go down myself first before I flop the name SR or even a vendor.
    <br/>
    Note that I do not ever plan on getting caught, but it the unknown, be prepared and take precautions.
