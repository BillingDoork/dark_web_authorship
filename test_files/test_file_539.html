    Although this is my first forum post, I've scoured the forums enough to realize that the real/fake name debate is an exhausted argument. I however have a more specific question which I don't see being addressed anywhere. If my question has already been answered, I apologize.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live with 4 other roommates, all of whom are cool with me ordering off of the sr. We naturally get a large influx of packages. Here is the dilemma though: Earlier this year we ordered (legal) goods from a fake name to the address. They came through fine and the mailman even wrote the fake name on a list of names for mail to be delivered to our box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since this is the case, would it not make more sense to use the fake name again for the sr? If worst comes to worst, how would they be able to blame any one member of the household when there are five of us who live there?

    Mistake #1, you told people.  Mistake #2, fake name.  Your roomates will probably steal your shit to the fake name and you will be the worst buyer in history whining about packages not coming, due to theft or lost in mail because of fake name.

    Well that was helpful  ::)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can get another name added to the recipient mailing list for that house its perfect! that way if you all deny it was for you there would be no actual name to push the liability in any one persons direction. So no 1 person can actually be taken in for questioning. its all or nothing However you must all trust that you will all say that you don't know who it was for. Also you must all trust each other enough to not tamper with each others packages.

    Not to be too negative on the roomie situation I would just say BE AMAZINGLY CAREFUL!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I might be a little older than you, had my fair share of roommates and have seen things go to complete shit with them for everything from eating someone's cookies to dating someone else's girl. It's all cool right now because you are friends and all in it equally but two years from now when you get in a fight over who owes what on a overdue power bill all of the sudden people can get a little insane and start thinking "You don't want to pay the $3.25 you owe? Fine, I'll just fucking send your ass to prison for five years on a staged drug bust you dick!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, just a reality check since life happens. If possible, it's best to just have drugs magically appear in your hands without others knowing where or how you got them. I don't want to put anyone in a situation where they need to rat me out to save or burn my ass and keeping things close really seems to help avoid that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, not trying to talk you out of it, just a little perspective is all. If you can do future stuff on the down low I think you'll find it's the best long term survival strategy.
