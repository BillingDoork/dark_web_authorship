    I'm interested to know what others have done in this case as well

    I'd assume there's nothing you CAN do since the entire enterprise is dependent upon shipping through the mail --  :P

    That's easy. You use a private mail box  or UPS mail box.

    If you are desperately in need a new shipping address, just go rent a PO box or an independent box rental even if it has to be in your name.  They rent by the month ..no big cash outla.l.

    That's true.  Whether you use your real name or you have fake ID..you need one photo ID and the other can be non-photo.

    As long as you have no other evidence that they can use against you, you should be fine.  If LEO arrested and charged everyone that received drugs in the mail I would be sending my enemies some dank smelling packages.

    Be overly cautious about basically everything and you can be less cautious, but still cautious, in other areas.

    If the guy absolutely cannot receive drugs at his home(and there can be many reasons) a box in his real name isn't the optimal alternative, you are correct.  However, it seemed as if he needed something else ASAP.  A box in his own name is better than nothing and it won't cost much.  It buys him some time to work on a more secure solution.
