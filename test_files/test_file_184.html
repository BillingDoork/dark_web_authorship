    Hey all, I'm new to SR but have access to some great BHO and just wondering what the best shipping and packaging methods are?   Also I'm curious how other people handle their stash.  We get BHO in those pyrex mini dishes with the sealing tops like they sell in Walmart, but they are really too big for small amounts like a g, usually we get em by the half z.  Thanks all!

    I just wanted to bump this thread.. I want to see what people think is the best way to ship BHO is domestically in the US, I know I prefer mine in glass but the stealth factor of a glass vessel cant be that high, and I hate dealing with wax paper smears....Anyone got any thoughts?

    I got a bunch of glass screw top vials, but if you're only getting a half O at a time, this may not be for you, hell, selling on here might be more then you can handle if that's the quantity you're working with. I bought thousands of jars for cheap since I had about 8 pounds of oil to jar, but you can get them at your local head shop for about 1.25-1.75 a piece, or you can order them from me in the packing material section for a little cheaper. These are a pain in the ass to jar and I have some nerve problems and have to pay people to jar for me, but the jars work great! Easy to pull a dab from, easy to melt out and get every last drop, easily fits in a coin pocket with a paper clip for pulling it out... It all depends on your product, if it's wax or shatter, you can get away with plastic cubes, if it's oil like what I have, these vials are the way to go. If you're just sending one, you can get away with the low postage price on a bubble mailer. If you're sending more than one, pay extra on postage, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap so it doesn't rattle and draw attention, then vac seal in mylar bags to avoid smell and xray detection, if you would like to see an example, just place an order  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't use plastic, wax paper is messy but works, glass is the only way to go when it comes to oil imo... Just need to keep it from rattling if you're shipping more then one. Check my listings to see the vials both empty and in use, and place an order to see how they are shipped!

    How many cans of lighter gas does it take to make an ounce of BHO?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OMG I go through about 3 or 4 cans just to make a gram.

    depends on the quality of the product you're blowing, stop when it's blowing clear, I ran giant tubes with 1-1.5 lbs per tube and got 1-2 oz per tube with 12-16 cans. You should expect roughly 10% yield, so if you have 10g of slash, you should get about 1g of hash, 1 pound raw = about 45g finished... But making this stuff in bulk is dangerous! Save your self the hassle of explaining why there was a 20 ft mushroom cloud coming from your back yard and keep your eyebrows on your head by just ordering from me!!!  ;D

    Jopular- If you are only recovering a gram with three cans, you are using too much butane and not enough material, or your input material is too low quality, recovery should be greater, say 10% from dry input, but its a VARIABLE....so if you load an OZ of good bud, you can expect perhaps 2-3g min  of raw oil once purged....Also to know when to stop running the butane through, wait for the column outflow to become clear, then take a few drops onto clean glass and dry- if there is no oil you are done...but as MHM said be careful, butane runs can be dangerous if not done outside and then not toooo many cans!  Best to use closed system procedures but those are best left to pros.

    Mendo- Thanks I was thinking about the use of small ca. 1-2 ml screw top vials, but I was imagining the pure joy of loading those!  Yea I wouldn't want to do it, at least not myself!  I might make an order from you to check your product, don't worry I'd never be a competitor, like I say I just have access to small quantities and wanted to share the pure goodness when it's available.  Are all vendors "strictly commercial" ie not selling just a few small lots here and there, but instead just larger volume, who can handle many many orders?  Anyway, I'm sure you are familiar with my above mentioned Skunk Farm Research, but if not, this guy is awesome to learn from and his presence is well known on many forums as Greywolf.  Do you for example winterize your oil?  I prefer winterized oil...I havn't checked out all the BHO vendors wares but at least some are vague in the descriptions of their products with regard to the processing details and source input material, which is key info when I buy.  I do notice you mention your input material, at least as a combination of strains, but that's better than many for sure.  I'm still pretty new to the Road however and have a lot to learn.  Peace out, thanks again for the info!

    I don't do the winterizing, I'm not a fan of ISO washes. I don't think every vendor is commercial, but I'd say most are, you could make a few sales I'm sure. I have posted very detailed descriptions of my process and materials, but it's not all in one place, lost in the forums somewhere! I might have to update my listings since many people are misunderstanding my wording. If you get a gram from me, the hash in the jar is only 1 strain, but the jars were not labeled so I don't know which jars are what strain. If you order 14g, you may get 1 strain or it could be as many as 5 different strains but each jar is only 1 strain. I do a combination of heat vacuum and whipping, my product didn't get finnished for a while, so it sat under purged for months and now I have to over do the heat a little to get all the gas out. It comes out clean, but the color is dark and the oil isn't as thick as I would like at times because of the heat needed.
