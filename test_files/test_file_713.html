    Think I can guess some of the comments but I wanted to get your opinion of the advisability &amp; risk of having one or 2 envelopes sent to a hotel that I'll be staying at. Sent to 'Name of reservation' C/O Hotel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This isn't an ideal situation, or a plan for regular pickup method but I'm going to be attending a festival overseas &amp; don't want to take anything through customs so, as I'll be staying for a few days in a hotel I thought this might be a solution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm particularly interested in what those who've worked in hotels have to say, did you ever get post addressed to guests, is this common, did it get opened?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    A friend of mine was in Amsterdam  and he got 5 grams of coke sent to his hotel, he actually placed the order before he even left the UK told the vendor what he was doing and it arrived the night he got to the Dam it was between 3 of them and he said it was the best coke hed ever had, I was thinking about doing it for some weed when I go to the states still unsure if its worth all the potential hassle though ordering a bit coke in Holland is one thing the US is another matter but it would mean I get to sample Cali's finest when in New York for 5 days.

    Well, if you look at it logically, usually when you stay in hotel it's in another city or even country. And for foreign tourists/visitors hotels should be used to receive mail from other countries. I'd say if you can order some stuff from the country you're coming from, it will be even less suspicious. Or order it to your home and just reship it to a hotel the day of your departure.

    I'd go with this idea. Then you can employ whatever stealth you feel would be perfect to fit the occasion, so you will be 100% sure the stealth is up to your standards.

    We've had several of our customers request that we ship to hotels for them, &amp; as long as you make sure to let them know in advance that you will be expecting either mail or packages, it will be cool, but get with your vendor to know what to expect so you can describe what they should be on the lookout for.

    one issue may be that there's no denial plausability. if you're specifically having it shipped to a hotel, it would seem much more difficult to tell LE "oh hey i don't know who sent that to me.. i've had no contact with the person who sent it"

    Firstly, I find it very coincidental that these forums pop up topics that I need all the time... I was about to do a search today on this very subject.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like the OP, I'll be going to a hotel but I will be driving and it will be domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been building a stash that I would like to take for the weekend, just a personal amount for 3 people during a festival. As I looked at the growing diversity of the stash I began to dread the paranoia of the 15 hour drive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that being said, is it only Love Letters that can be successfully mailed to the Hotel? - Can I use a flat rate box?
    <br/>
    Should I put it in the mail a day or two before we start driving? 15 Hours
    <br/>
    If I have already registered online and paid for the rooms - will it be OK if package arrives earlier than me?

    We will be renting a car for the drive, same technique still apply? - Also, is it worth the risk driving with substances that dogs are trained to smell i.e. weed? Again it would only be a quarter or so.

    How long are you staying at the hotel? 2 pieces sounds slightly risky, but if you notify the front desk / staff that you are expecting 2 letters or packages during your stay and then ask exactly how it should be addressed you should be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I once stayed at a hotel for a week and the beds were so shitty I couldn't sleep, so I had a relative ship me like 20 oxys FedEx Overnight (this was long before SR and I had no idea it isn't safe to ship FedEx and UPS) and they did no stealth at all, just pills in a bag. Made it just fine and then the rest of my trip was gravy!

    So the general conclusion here is that if you notify the hotel, it's generally safe to have it sent, and they'll hold it for you at the front desk if you're not there when it comes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seems kind of ideal for a lot of things that are flat/easily able to fit in an envelope without issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this sort of "need to please" even more true at nicer or "business" hotels" Express is usually document shaped, so - seems like it would easy to blend in.

    I always do this when traveling, and have yet to have it fail.  Just make sure you call the front desk beforehand to A. Ask how their specific hotel wants the address formatted - most are slightly different and B. Inform them of when the package should be arriving.  Most hotels are flexible w/ how long they'll hold the package as long as you keep them updated on when it's arriving/when you're arriving.  Never had a hotel say less than a week, and most will do up to a month.  I usually send it a lil over a week in advance so if it somehow doesn't make it I can figure out a backup plan.

    Also, it might be worth asking if they have any large conferences staying there.  During conferences/trade shows, hotel mail holding rooms are a MESS, and I'd suggest doing two things.  First, send the package tracked and call the hotel to let them know it's arriving.  Second, write your name in HUGE fucking letters all over the package, or make sure it's easily identifiable somehow.  I've had a couple scares where the hotel told me that my package wasn't in the storage room after a 15min search, then had them call my room later to tell me they found it.

    As far as plausible deniability goes, I don't see that being an issue.  If you're really worried, you can always address it to someone who's not paying for the room.  Hotel staff isn't going to ask for an ID for a package ever - their job is to serve you during your stay, not hassle you.  If you tell them there's a package for [insert name] w/ [insert identifiable traits] in the mail room, they're just gonna go grab it and hand it to you.
