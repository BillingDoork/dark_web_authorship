    Given Iran's current good terms with America and the rest of the world, I'd say mail going there from the States will be given extra scrutiny. But that's just my theory.

    I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of that deal. They're punishment for receiving drugs in the mail is probably less fun than America's.

    I have some in laws that live in Iran an I can tell you know that would be a terrible idea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would not be on the receiving end of that deal in Iran. No fucking way!!!!!!!!! I had the bright idea of trying to get H sent over from Iran to me in USA cause it only 20 $ a gram for the bomb shit. After a few test packages with no contraband inside I could tell everyone had been opened. I quickly forgot about that shit an am happy to pay 10x more for it in the states.

    well.. considering the fact, that you might get in big trouble in that country... maybe not that good of an idea.

    <br/>
    on the other hand... iran does have the biggest heroin problem in the world. there is so much blow coming in in from Afghanistan. Guess that might help you.

    Would likely be subject to scrutiny at least twice, once while leaving the US and then when entering Iran.

    Not sure, but you would think that drug use would come under its jurisdiction. Shit, a list of banned hairstyles exists in Iran.

    But, hopefully it gets a little better with the new President
