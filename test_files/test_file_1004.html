    I've purchased cannabis before, where multiple layers are required to properly stealth the product but I've never purchased MDMA.  Is vacuum sealing or any other method required?  In this case, domestic shipping USA to USA.

    MDMA has a strong odor which drug dogs are able to detect. From most orders I've done on here, the MDMA has come in one vacuum sealed bag as a minimal precaution. This in itself will not prevent a dog from sniffing out the MDMA if it ever comes to that point, but the majority of MDMA orders come in non-suspicious envelopes/boxes and probably would not be flagged. This is especially true for orders that don't have to go through customs, as in your case. Do note however, that vacuum sealing alone does not eliminate odors and smells will eventually permeate the seal. Using heat sealed Moisture Barrier Bags will provide more adequate odor suppression.
    <br/>

    If you would like to see what top of the line shipping methods look like and help support a starting US domestic vendor, then feel free to come in to my shop and order. I utilize vacuum and moisture barrier bags for ultimate stealth to completely eliminate any odor or suspicion.
