    Umm...Of course they do not all make it for a variety of reason's wrong address,lost and custom's seizure.There is ALWAYS a risk that something will not arrive the best thing is to look at feedback and pick the right Vendor.
    <br/>
    If something looks off in feedback it usually is just like if a vendor has very good feedback shipping to your Country then you will have a better chance of a smooth transaction but nothing is guaranteed nothing.
    <br/>
    I wish you the best on your order.

    I've ordered about 5 times from EU and they have all showed. I just got an order from England and it took 3 days. Ordered Friday and I had it in hand on Monday. I couldn't believe it when I saw it arrived already, I never expected it that fast.

    from whom did you order it? I ordered from Alice last week Aug 1 and still dont know if it will arrive. I'm guessing its getting harder to send stuff to USA from European countries.

    I don't order from overseas since I saw a documentary on shipping drugs to the US.  The Postal Service X-Rays many of the packages coming in and Postal Inspectors have a lot of experience with narcotics. They know many of the tell-tale signs of a package containing contraband, such as items that have been triple vacuum sealed, or blister paks of pills.

    Mail sent to and from a US destination rarely gets this kind of scrutiny.

    While I'm not dismissing learning from documentaries..... Most documentaries about drugs, such as these "Drug's Inc" documentaries, cast a HUGE cloud of fear over everything. They make it sound like it's impossible to get away with, too easy to get caught, etc. Which in most cases such ideas couldn't be further from the truth(within reason). If these things are so hard to get away with, yet they make a documentary about how rampant and common of a problem that sort of stuff is, then that right there is telling you it's not as easy as they make it sound. A little inference goes a long way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First of all, not everything gets X-rayed, it's most often suspicious packages that stick or have pill spilling out of them. Postal Inspectors, while it is their job to inspect things, most honestly could not give a rats ass about legitimate looking mail that may have drugs in it. It is too much of an inconvience for them to pull apart every peice of mail that could be something, because they would be pulling apart everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Postal inspectors do not pick up and analyze every package. They inspect the flow of mail. They have to do this for hours and hours looking at thousands of peices of mail so really only the extremely suspicious mail is going to stand out, stuff that's leaking liquid, stinking up the room, ticking/beeping(bomb/terrosim), etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most controlled deliveries and seizurs happen due to poor/half assed packaging(or a snitch), which in any event it seems CD's are rare, at least here, because most vendors use some pretty good stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It should also be noted Drug Dogs can only be trained to smell one drug. They don't have 10 dogs at every inspection center. From my experience and observation it seems the number one seized substance, judging by feedback, is Cocaine. Cocaine trafficking/importation is a HUGE problem for the DEA and is one of their main concerns. More cocaine is imported into the USA than any other drug, and it's probably similar for other countries. 1/2 of every coke orders(even small 1/2g orders) that I see on SR get lost/siezed.

    Dog..  don't let some fear-based documentary keep you from ordering from abroad.  The 2 international packs that never made it to me, I don't believe were ever sent in the first place.

    I'm waiting on a package from EU, as well. I guess it really all depends on the vendor. Usually the more successful vendors use some pretty impressive techniques to get their product through customs. There's ALWAYS a possibility of it getting nabbed, though - domestic or international

    my 2 cents,

    I order shrooms 10 times from the Netherlands pre silk rd....
    <br/>
    8 times they cam through... two times I received a letter saying organic matter cannot be shipped to the states... but there was no follow up after the fact...

    most orders arrived in a couple of weeks... if it took longer I knew that it was seized...

    The only international orders I didn't receive were ones where the seller tried to scam me and then basically went rogue. F16 and Eazyjet for any old timers who care. Every other pack has made it without issue, to a handful of addresses. I did receive a love letter from customs when they seized 10 rolls that I had ordered from MIMM. I shredded it and have stopped ordering international to that location. Domestic still works successfully though. I wouldn't tweak too hard, unless your getting bulk, like over 28g felony drugs that kinda thing.

    I've had &gt;5 Sucessful orders from EU. One envelope appeared to have had holes poked in it to possibly see if substances would fall out. Luckily the vendor I ordered from performed grade A stealth.
