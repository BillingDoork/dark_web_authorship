    I'm curious about this. It seems to be moving exceedingly slowly and changing its emphasis significantly. Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?
    <br/>
    I don't object to its failure to progress, by the way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My first thought was that perhaps they were slowing all mail down to parcel-post speed to annoy the fuck out of us, thereby shifting the trade to common carriers so that packages could be opened more easily...
    <br/>
    But I don't think that's it.

    Yes, I realize the Nat'l Drug Control Strategy report is about as reality associated as a National Unicorn Census, but it does give indicators.

     One forthcoming domestic enforcement tool is the development of the National Parcel Post Initiative. (Action Item 5.3G) This initiative will help state and local law enforcement identify suspicious packages, analyze emerging trends in parcel post trafficking and interdiction, and learn about the appropriate procedures and guidelines for these types of investigations. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS), ONDCP, DHS, and private mail delivery services are developing a nationwide training effort for law enforcement officers so they can effectively counter the emerging trend of using mail couriers to traffic and distribute drugs. In addition, CBP, USPS, and Royal Mail (UK) have joined to implement a pilot program in 2011 to develop an inbound mail manifest system to identify and target suspicious international packages in airports.

     Develop National Parcel Post Initiative:
     <br/>
     The National Parcel Post Initiative focuses on drug trafficking organizations using parcel shipping services to transport illegal drugs and drug proceeds In 2012, 17 HIDTAs funded a parcel post task force. These investigations rely on full cooperation and full information sharing among all HIDTA member agencies, task forces, fellow agencies, and task forces in other jurisdictions.
     <br/>
     CBP, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the United States Postal Service are working with the Universal Postal Union and others in the international postal community to enhance the screening of international mail prior to its conveyance to the United States. The parties are developing the foundations for providing advance electronic data on international mail packages to allow CBP and TSA to perform risk-based targeting prior to foreign departure and entry into the domestic mail supply chain. This strategy will enhance CBPâ€™s ability to identify, interdict, and disrupt the movement of illicit narcotics as well as stem the persistent threat posed by the smuggling of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and gray market goods. This approach is also linked to the Long Term Strategy for the Screening of International Mail and the Global Supply Chain Strategy.

    Nothing pressing, I am just better at locating and indexing information when I know the right terms. :)
