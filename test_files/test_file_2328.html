    I was just wondering if it is necessary for you to put your real name into the address box when making a purchase. It just kind of sketches me out real bad having meth shipped to my house with my name on it.

    Personally I would have said it doesn't matter what name you use, as long as the address is correct and no one will open it in your house apart from you, you should be OK. Unless you're super pally with your postman.  :)

    you run the risk of having your package not be delivered unless you use the name of someone who regularly receives mail at that location
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you can risk it as long as you are willing to take full responsibility for the order not being delivered. you should not request a refund or re-shipment and blame it on the vendor if you decide to use a fake name

    Really depends on the country you live in. It matters in the U.S as names are linked to addresses through the U.S.P.S, however in countries like Australia, you can basically write any name on any address and it will definitely arrive (unless you use a name that previously lived at the address who has had their mail re-directed) because Aust. Post doesn't use a system that links names to addresses.

    Use the real name of whomever lives at the address you're shipping to.  It looks more suspicious if you don't, and there's a much higher chance of inspection/seizure.

    like others have said you won't necessarily receive it  if you use a false name and it could look more suspicious (with a false name). In the rare chance that it does get inspected you can always say you had no idea somebody was sending you the substance or why it would happen and you're off the hook unless they have clear evidence of receiving many shipments. Imagine if you could go to jail just for receiving something illegal. People would send blatantly illegal items addressed to an enemy in order for them to be put in jail.

    Hey guys. This is a little bit unrelated to the topic going on here, but I recently ordered from a vendor that offered two different shipping options, USPS First Class and USPS Priority Mail W/DCN.
    <br/>
    I selected the USPS First Class option for the delivery of my package and I received the package under the delivery method of USPS Priority Mail W/DCN. Is is possible for a vendor to change the postage option? Under my transaction history, it says that the USPS Priority Mail W/DCN was used and I payed for it, but I KNOW I did not select this. Does anyone know?? I left a bad review and the vendor is upset. I just need clarification if I am wrong and I mistakenly hit the wrong option, or the vendor really did screw me over. Thanks guys

    That is not very good advice in my opinion PH
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A large portion of the people complaining their order did not arrive have used previous tenants addresses
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just because you receive some mail for them does not mean you will receive important mail - the usps policy is to either forward or return to sender - not to deliver, even years after
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you dont use a name of who currently lives there - then dont be upset when your order doesnt show and DO NOT blame it on the vendor or expect any refund or re-ship

    Spoken like a true newbie.  If the vendor upgraded your shipping, you should be happy.  How do you think that the vendor charged you after you already paid?  And if you accidentally selected priority and then paid for it, that certainly isn't the vendors fault.  These are the only 2 scenarios that could have occurred.  Vendors cannot change your order selections and then retroactively charge you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sounds like you have a review to change and an apology to write.  Just hope your vendor doesn't blackball you.

    I didnt even see that question from Reckless *edit oh thats because it was from over a month ago... why did this thread get brought back up???*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is all on you - the vendor cant just change your selection and cost you extra money... what you chose is what will show on the order
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if he did upgrade you should have said thank you as mentioned that you got your package quicker
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors will use DCN for their own security
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I really dont understand what you were upset about or why you would ever leave a bad review- no wonder the vendor was upset
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should go change the feedback and apologize imo

    If you've EVER had ANY mail delivered to you at that address (even junk mail) ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    !!! USE YOUR REAL NAME !!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Firstly, if you put no name at all it's likely to be return to sender by your postal carrier immediately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly, if you put someone elses name it will stick out like a sore thumb to your postal carrier, they have to sort like 300 houses or however many is on their route every single day of the week of mail.  After a while it becomes kinda auto-pilot for them to look for YOUR name on any mail because they have a shit tonne of mail to sort through before even delivering it, they do it every day, and they just learn to do it by memorization/pattern recognition to get their job done before the end of the day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You want your illicit packages to BLEND IN and LOOK NORMAL.  When they see your name they throw it in the pile for your street.  They see someone else's name at that address they pick up that piece of mail and actually look at it to make sure they've read the right address.  Do you want that?  NO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are worried about the police, they'll only catch you on a controlled delivery  They don't do on small mail and/or unless they've established a case against you, it's expensive and man-power consuming to carry out a CD, they're only going to set one up if they have some case to build on and it's large quatities/etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If pigs knock on your door for some reason and you have that piece of mail in your hand (and you havn't opened it) there is JACK SHIT they can do to you.  PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What if your crazy ex is sending you drugs to get you busted?  If you don't open it and are asked what it is you say "I HAVE NO IDEA, I NEVER ORDERED THIS AND HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS RETURN ADDRESS"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In other words, if you're THAT paranoid then just don't open the mail for a day or two, if no PO PO comes a knocking then you are fine.  Really though you should just open it (destroy the packaging) and put the illegal materials somewhere ya know ... hidden (off your property even).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's international and it's caught it will be seized, you'll be sent a letter saying it's been seized and to call XXX or go to XXX if you wish to claim it.  Burn the letter and DO NOT call or go to them, consider it a lucky loss.  Don't have illicit materials sent to that address again, however, if you get a love letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They're after the vendor's trying to import kilogram's of meth into the country, not $100 worth ... there just isn't enough man power for them to care and/or be able to bust every single small order of illegal materials.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make everything look NORMAL and it will BE NORMAL.
    <br/>
    Tell the vendor to use the name "Barack Obama" and ... you're a fool lol.

    All sensible home owner's i've ever known have their mail forwarded from their old home (the one you are currently residing in and having the mail sent to) to their new address.

    All that will happen is your drugs will be forwarded to the old home owner's new address, they'll open it and find drugs and ... you fill in the rest.

    Not true (at least in Australia). All it takes is one call from customs to the local authorities in your area, who then put the on-call detectives on the case, and snap. I have heard of people that have gone down this way, for such stupidly small amounts, all because they used their real address and real names.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the address is in a rural location, or you live in a small town and you have no other means of sending it somewhere else, Id be more inclined to use your real name, as rural drivers always know each address and all the names associated with it. For somewhere like the suburbs/the city, Id always use a different name. Postmen are too busy to care about names in such places.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once you've been busted, you can never go back
