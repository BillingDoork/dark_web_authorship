    Can someone please tell me which countries are sketchy to order from? I'm in the US.  I know the netherlands is one, but what are some more I should stay away from?

    Of my knowledge (having a family member in customs) the list is: Netherlands, Afghan, India, Brazil, Columbia, Portugal, and certain parts of China known for RX's. More often than not if you think drugs are easy to get there than it's probably watched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are worried about a package in customs, I always choose domestic over international. Priority with no DCN in domestic is always the way to go in my book.

    Because USA doesn't play nice with countries that have loose drug policies. It's insanely easy/low risk to get drugs into Portugal and then ship them out, like the Netherlands. No idea why other than that and from what I have been told. It's sad really...

    Yeah in Portugal possession is decriminalized. (of course in personal use quantities). But I guess this makes it easy for friends and family to buy some stuff for people overseas and pop it in the mail. All risk free. I'm actually surprised we don't see more Portuguese vendors on there.

    Good point, but my idea is that the inbound customs really looks hard at a package from, say, Bolivia, but not as hard at the myriad of packages coming in from Taiwan, no?

    If you are actually looking for any REAL that is to say verified information you are in the wrong place. Everyone has their theories and their personal experience, but unless LE wants to verify their ID and actually tell us you're never going to know for sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My personal take is that if you are ordering personal amounts it SEEMS to be more about the vendor and their M.O. than their country of origin. I say this after ordering on here for 15 months to Australia which if you believe the hype has very effective customs.

    I've placed 4-5 Orders all from different vendors over 3 weeks ago and have only received the one from a local vendor, if my other orders don't come in and I go to resolution centre will this affect my stats. These are my first orders on SR

    Some countries are certainly watched more than others. People still get stuff through from them all the time though. Of course anything international is far more risky than domestic. But people get international packs through all the time. I know people who have gotten heroin shipped from Afganistan so anything is possible :).
