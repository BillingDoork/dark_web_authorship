    Hi SR
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good day to you all, I just made this account for the sake of posting this question but I hope to stick around to see if I can help anybody out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So here goes, and this may sound a little paranoid, but bare with me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    About 7-8 weeks ago I ordered a custom listing for myself containing 4 grams of weed  (was probably overweight). It was a domestic package so I thought there was no problem, as I've been using SR for over a year and had 20+ successfully deliveries with no lost packages containing various things (up to this point), however one guy in Northern Europe noted that the packaging wasn't great as he could slightly smell weed when he sniffed it, he did however receive it so I assumed I would. However, a week past and no package, domestic priority usually takes 1 day, so the seller gave me a refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the time I was using a service whereby my mail was not delivered to my address but held for me at the local delivery office intended for people on holiday, I used it because I often ordered large packages (of legit things), and I often got cards saying I had to go to the delivery office to pick it up, so I decided it would he easier if everything was sent there as I go past it every day. I am worried that using this service had attracted suspicion to my mail as I had several  packages from different countries (containing drugs of course, but they were all given to me while I was using this service), so 1 month later I cancelled this service and asked for all packages to be delivered to my address to avoid drawing further attention to my mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now however, I am worried that it was the local delivery office that confiscated my weed (I originally assumed it would have happened somewhere else along the distribution chain, as this was most likely and it wouldn't have been much of a problem for future orders) and that cancelling the service itself drew attention to my post further.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I now believe that either my post is being handed to the police for inspection before being delivered or that the delivery office is holding and inspecting it themselves before delivering it to me. Why do I think this? Because around 2 weeks after cancelling, I ordered 2 shirts off the internet, non-priority domestic ( 2-3 days, 80% of the time 2) and they all took 5-6, very unusual. About a week later I ordered 1 more thing that took 4 working days (non priority). On this Monday, had something sent priority to me and it is Tuesday and has not arrived, I also had something sent non-priority and I'm waiting to see what will happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, do you think I am right in my hypotheses that my mail is suddenly taking longer because it is being taken away for inspection, or do you think there is another explanation? I do know the postal service has been cutting back to save money this year, but it does seem strange as to why delivery is suddenly taking longer. And if you think it's possible, what should I do in terms of trying to get more drugs safely online?? I was going to order quite a lot of weed, LSD, shrooms and MDMA round about now, but I am cautious of doing so because of this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    PS: Since the weed went missing, I've only ordered one thing illegal, 5 hits of LSD from another country which came very quickly, which was before I cancelled the service. I have had lots of letters but I do not know the time taken from posting to delivery.

    TL;DR: About 1-2 months ago some weed went missing, at the time my mail was being held at delivery office for collection as opposed to being delivered to my address. Some drugs were given to me from around the world using this service, worried this made them suspicious. About a month ago, I cancelled this service, and 1-2 weeks later all my mail started taking a lot longer than usual. Worried this is because it is being passed to police for inspection before delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think this is likely, if so, how likely? And what should I do as I plan to order lots of drugs soon?
    <br/>

    I greatly appreciate your help!

    You may just be paranoid because of the intercepted package from before. I don't know where you live, but 4g of cannabis is not really a big deal, especially for police to get involved. Again, this may depend on where you live. Also, there may be a change in internal operations at the post office. As far as one near where I used to live, they totally changed up their processing times, which was a hassle because anything that wasn't paid for (next-day, 2 day, ect) was automatically tossed in a bin for processing - which occurred about a week later, or several days if you're lucky. Granted, this was an explanation I got from a neighbor who worked there. The story I got from the post-office itself was totally different - "We do our best to treat each item as important as the next." Basically, it came down to whether or not you paid $30+  for next day shipping or whether you decided to use the "free version" of the USPS. Also, since you ordered and received LSD even after the missing package incident, you're most likely fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry for rambling.

    Haha it's okay, I think you can see I rambled for much longer than you did.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in the EU, don't really want to elaborate, the drug laws where I live are not decriminalised like some of the other European coutries, but rest assured they are not as draconian as Singapore/Turkey standards either, somewhere in between. The LSD I received was from the Netherlands of all places, so yeah you could be right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing I would say is that part of me worries they may have  noticed several other foreign packages from before (that is, if it was my local delivery office that intercepted the weed) and thus because of catching the weed they told the police they suspect I'm a drug dealer or something. Idk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I should probably add I had two packages (one priority, one non-priority) sent very quickly no problem about a week after cancelling the  service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just wonder what others think, so if anyone else has any ideas as to what's happened, or more importantly, how I should handle future buying please say so. Just trying to clear my mind here to be honest, sorry guys.
