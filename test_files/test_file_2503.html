    Some vendor is giving me grief. It has been 1 month since they said they would ship it, and even admit to not shipping it (and even now admit to still having not shipped it). They are asking for tx# for over a month ago, and I'm a total SR newbie. Where can I see my past list of transactions on TSR?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want my product or a refund and it seems like the tx# would be something he should already have....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this sketchy at all??

    Click on Account =&gt; On the right hand side you should see Account Links which has few options "Account History", "Settings" etc =&gt; Click on Account History and you should be able to get it from there. I don't know for how long they store that information, I'm fairly new to this as well, I can see that my first transaction is not there anymore so my guess is that they delete it after a while.

    Yeah man that's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm set up for failure here... there is no way I can provide him the tx# which I think will give him a reason to not give me a full refund or some shit...

    it's like 1 bitcoin, but god damnit I refuse to be jipped and I will get it back based on principle.
