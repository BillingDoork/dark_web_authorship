    they got so many great strains and stuff i'd like to try out. do people really have much success with this. i'm guessing a shitload of mail must come from the states each day so it can't be too bad.

    Just order from a vendor who has good packaging. Find feedback on them, ideally order form a vendor who uses MBB or mylar bags.

    You should be fine.

    My understanding, from reading the messages on this forum for a couple of years, is that all packages sent from one country to another are much more likely to be flagged for inspection. It's always tempting to order from another country when you're looking for someting special that is not available locally. Be careful though, and be aware that you're more likely to never get your order from overseas. Domestic shipments, in most countries, are far safer.

    make sure its worth it... or make sure you got an excellent drop.

    i guess that there is a lot of mail, but mail that is looking the way you will receive... maybe not that much. there isn't much stuff produced in the US anymore. and if you order more than one G, it won't look like paper anymore from the outside.
    <br/>
    if you do that a dozen times, i estimate the odds of somebody getting caught are above 50%.

    Can MBB beat dogs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Search youtube border security uk or something. there often are documentaries that will give you some idea of what kind of work is done there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And you take into account that the letters are 100% scanned and stored. So even if, you get the mail... it might bite you in the a$$ down the road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    on the other hand.. i know what shitty skunk you have in the uk...  ;D ;D

    I know next to nothing about the US and there customs so i'm not going to go guessing the odds of a seizure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I would do if I was in your shoes is order a very small amount at first to a address that has nothing to do with you just to test the water.
    <br/>
    Also If you can find an address to have your stuff dropped that is not affiliated with you don't have to worry about getting caught down the line.
    <br/>

    Moisture barrier bags are meant to be dog proof yes. They are certainly a huge improvement over your average vac seal thats for sure!

    I've just had an order of bud from the US not arrive after 18 days of waiting for it. The thing is now though, it's not really necessary to order from the US to see the same type of quality. I could name at least 5 vendors in the UK who offer brilliant bud for reasonable prices.
