    My mates love the shit I get (which i get from here obv - but they have no idea) and want more, but fucked if I want to deal with having larger quantities sent to my address so I was tinkering with them cashing me up and placing orders for them with the delivery address being their place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The caveat is they will never know how I order the shit but that they have to be prepared to have it arrive magically as mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they don't want the best they then can piss off and enjoy third grade shit from elsewhere.

    What cha think?

    I have done it once for a very good friend who knows the score and would never talk if the shit hit the fan, only a small order anyway so if it were intercepted it would just not arrive. To answer your question I would say no it is a very bad idea involving anyone else in your business on here, for a start it could end very badly for you if they did get compromised, if I were you i'd keep it simple, low key and above all else as safe as possible by involving no one else.

    I'd tend towards the thanks but no thanks end of the bargain. But if your confident that its only small sizes and a few close mates AND they know the risks (that it might not turn up) then it is something worth considering.

    If it was a small, personal-use order, I would just have it delivered to my address and charge them a personal delivery fee.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's not a lot of other options where I'm located, so they'll pay up. ;p

    I see no problem with using your account to order for your friends as long as you use their address. They want the drugs, they can take the risk of getting caught. Show them you ordering it for them so there is no doubt that you paid, the danger of it not arriving is also on them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do not have it shipped to yourself. Not only are you taking the risk of being caught, but if it does not arrive you have introduced the doubt that you may have just kept it. Having them watch you pay and having it shipped to them lets them know for sure that a non-arrival is the vendors fault not yours.

    You should charge a fee for this service, they can after all make their own account and buy their own bitcoins. Another way to go would be to help them set up an account and then sell them coupon codes so they don't have to find bitcoins.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The added bonus is that having multiple names/addresses associated with your account makes it more difficult to profile your account to a specific person.

    I think showing them what you are doing is adding an unnecessary step and provides them with information they don't need to know and goes against one of the pillars of SR - anonymity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they want the shit that bad and they know you can get it then the risk/reward scenario needs to be spelt out to them. I.e. "I can get you shit for $XX (reward) but you will receive it like this (risk)."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's up to you to allay their concerns about the likelihood that they could get caught. Get cash off them so nothing electronic connects you to them then away you go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They can only get a refund IF they show a love letter - does that sound familiar to you?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically give them no names or intel about how they receive their magic package, that way when they are 'being the man' with their mates there is nothing they can accidentally divulge.
