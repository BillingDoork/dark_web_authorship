    Hello there,
    <br/>
    I am thinking about opening a PO box in order to receive risky shipments. I was currently thinking about opening a PO box under a fake name, but I know there are better ways. Could someone enlighten me on how to receive shipments under a fake business name? I know it is possible.
    <br/>
    Thanks,

    To my understanding, the general consensus is opening a P.O. Box is just a bad idea. Especially with fake info. You're just adding more felonies/suspicious activity to your operation. Pine has preached for some time that virtual offices are the way to go, and that most should be able to be setup all online. With this, you get a virtual business address along with a "business name" and private mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe pine could chime in here, or someone else with experience. How do you setup a VirtualOffice without having to use an ID to open it? Lots of searching has only lead me to two that I could sign up online. I just have a feeling when you show up, they're going to need to see some form of identification. Suggestions?

    I used a mailbox (not USPS) for my first few months on the road - I came to the conclusion that it's just not worth it. First of all, more than likely you're on camera. Second, it costs you. Third, chances are if you order anything but a letter-sized package you still have to go in, interact with the clerk, and more than likely sign something. I use my name now, not a hundred percent OK with that, but it's actually less sketchy than the mailbox IMO.

    What about a mail-forwarding service?

    I could possibly get a friend to open a PO box for me and have him give me the keys.... but I don't know if that would just add more risk.

    Acquiring an approved secondary ID form is quite simple as a photo is not required.  It can be as simple as learning how to edit a PDF and simply printing it out.

    Consensus?  What it is..is lots of inexperienced SR members mistakenly taking the bad advice of a few other inexperienced members.  Of all the people who have been at this for more than a  few years... you won't find even one who thinks having drugs mailed to your house in your name is a good idea.

    Agreed!  Get a safe drop somehwere.  Either a friend or someone with a clean house that you can send to.  Or a PO Box under another name.  You will be glad you took these precautions when a shipment doesn't show up one day.....instead of waiting for them to bust your door in at your house.

    If it's too expensive for you, then you can use the fact you have a month to play with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make the investment, order your stuff, and then put the mailbox to work for you, you advertise this service to your SR using pals you know IRL. They pay you a service charge, and as a result don't have to deal with pickup and using their own residential address, two things which I'm sure will make you fairly popular. Obviously you have to be careful here. But if you stagger out the orders incoming, then it shouldn't be a problem. Make a chart of the possession/intent to supply quantities and do the math, and you could not only have your very own virtual office, but also a new source of income.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is also the fact if your pals are willing to wait a while for a staggered delivery, then you'll be able to arbitrage your position with SR vendors as a middleman by converting smaller orders of the same product into larger ones (with their permission). This way you earn more, and they get cheaper product, everybody wins.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    In many cases, you can separate the virtual office concept from the virtual office mailbox and pay less, just check it out in case. Often its $50 or $60 per month. Really! Familiarize yourself with virtual office jargon, maybe there's a slew of websites for your area you completely overlooked.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    Virtual offices are not regulated in the same way as private mail boxes. USPS is a federal institution, whereas virtual office corporations are CMRAs, or Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies. It can depend on a bunch of stuff in your jurisdiction but a legal violation against the federal government is generally treated more harshly. e.g. if you use government stationary to commit fraud it will be treated much more seriously than doing the same thing with a corporation. More to the point my lawyer says that any time an individual uses U.S. Mail, the telephone, the internet, or a fax machine in order to commit a crime, the crime can be prosecuted in the federal criminal justice system. Good to know. Stay in-state! (I'm not implying you shouldn't use USPS, I'm saying you will probably get additional charges for using them to hold your drugs for you).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CMRAs cannot receive registered mail due to the south westerly prevailing winds of Communism but pretty much anything else is fine. If you use registered mail or tracking numbers on SR you have bigger problems than your address I'll say. You need tracked mail containing drugs with entries in government databases like you need a hole in the head.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    --
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You may need ID in your jurisdiction, but the main reason why I'm a fan of CMRAs is that in practice virtual office people couldn't give flying fuck if you were trying to fit a giraffe into your pigeon hole. To put it another way, they want your money. I'm not saying you need to bride these guys, that's usually a bad idea. You don't need to, they are just happy to see you and find bureaucracy as annoying as you do. Fill out the paperwork if it is necessary (prep in advance), but the important thing is the character of the person behind the counter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've said it before, but if your virtual office service provider has a rod up his ass about this rule and that rule, then just tell him to fuck himself and take your business elsewhere. This is important. The very second it feels like this dude is doing you a favor by accepting your business, you get up and walk out. You have to avoid these kinds of white knight civilians like the plague, they may take liberties with examining your deliveries such as opening them. I've heard of at least one person getting clipped this way (postal worker with nosy parker syndrome).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ID requirements are avoidable in many cases because you can do the entire thing online with minimal fuss. If they request ID when you request your key/token/card at the reception then you can either just say you left it at work and collect your parcels, or give them a 'novelty' identification card. I have never been asked for ID once. Perhaps others have more pertinent advice for your jurisdiction.

    Tran-shipping can be a very useful concept in certain situations (more instances of Communism for example), I think hucquay has mentioned one of those.

    Don't worry about CCTV. Honestly. It is easily defeated. Wear sunglasses and a cap in summer. Never wear a hoodie. Never wear a leather jacket. For some strange reason everybody thinks people wearing hoodies or leather jackets are drug dealers. Somebody should do a Phd thesis in domestic anthropology or something to discover why that is. In my experience all the drug dealers I've known wear jeans and t-shirts, smart casuals or business suits. Because they're like, you know, people and not beings from another world. Weird isn't it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway I've done experiments with image recognition and sunglasses. Turns out the best are wraparound mirrored sunglasses. Snow or ski glasses are awesome, but often not big enough, you want those aviator style sunglasses. It's not a matter of coming close to a match. It's not even in the ball park. From 100% pattern matching efficiency to zero. Seriously. The key thing is to focus on the bridge of your nose and the distance between your eyes, and sunglasses perfectly obfuscate this. If image recognition gets better we'll work out a way around that too. For example, you can use a powerful infrared LED, invisible to the naked eye, but with an infrared sensitive CCTV at night time (most are because I think that's the spectrum they use to see at night) it turns you into a giant white halo to the camera. Completely impenetrable radius of light. It's spooky to see it done, like something from a movie, do a Google search and you'll see what I mean. Protip: traffic surveillance cameras that use OCR on license plates really, really hate this technology, you can replace one or two LEDS with your friend Mr Mechanic and say goodbye to traffic surveillance forever. It's not illegal to do this, albeit I don't do it myself because I prefer not to stand out.

    I neglected to mention, there *are* ways of obtaining an address, it's not actually like I'm completely hung up on virtual offices, it's just that everybody seems to think PMBs are the best thing since sliced bread and I keep saying it ain't so, but these other ways tend to be location specific.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    e.g. the pigeon hole system for students and other people in shared accommodation (I have a entire tutorial on it, just search my posts for "pigeon hole")
    <br/>
    e.g. pseudo mail drops (works best in the countryside, where mailboxes are at the end of very long driveways or situations where there's lots of holiday homes)
    <br/>
    e.g. homeless people obtain their mail through different systems for free, no ID or anything required, so go Google that shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and so on, you just got to use your imagination and flex a few ideas out.

    Wearing sunglasses inside an office building is pretty suspicious. Even here in cataract Australia - unless you make the effort to dress like a tradie, they never take off their sunglasses.

    I would rather wear a leather jacket, like a pre 90s criminal. Or even a hoodie, the stereotype attire of post 90s criminals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you have any other ideas for avoiding cameras?
