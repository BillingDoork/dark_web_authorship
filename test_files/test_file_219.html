    So ordered a very small order from a new vendor MeanHerb on Monday, supposedly ships priority and marked in transit on Monday. Didn't receive today and I usually get priority coast to coast within three day reliably. Messaged about it and get this response from the vendor:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "There is small issue with the DCN. I believe the lady at the post office didn't scan them in correctly. 1 of the following things will happen.. All of the packages will be sent out marked as "postage due". You'll have to pay the mail man $.78 for the DCN (I know its doesn't make sense to pay 2 times for a DCN). I can only assume they are being sent back to the address I have on the envelope. If for some reason I can't recover the package(s) I will issue a full refund or resend more product (with extra added for the inconvenience). I am very sorry about this, obviously none of this was my intention. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. I do have the DCN number so (eventually when they're scanned) I will be able to track the whereabouts of the package(s).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMPORTANT: If for any reason I can't recover the package(s), YOU ARE SAFE they will go to a center and be destroyed!! They WILL NOT be opened by the postmaster."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is annoying and kinda nerve wracking, first thoughts were maybe scammer? LEO? amateur hour?  But at any rate, anyone with experience and input with DCN issues and postage due situations would be appreciated to alleviate some of my anxiety.

    I think I'm in the same boat as you and was beginning to get worried. I placed an order with Meanherb that supposedly shipped 6 days ago and have yet to receive it. I messaged him yesterday asking if he could track my order for me but I haven't heard back yet. It was a very small order so if it never shows I won't have suffered too much of a loss.

    Sounds like the vendor has made an error but is reassuring you as to your safety, This error could add time to your delivery, I would go and look at his transaction history and if he has no transactions and or feedback, I would then clean my house just to be causious give the vendor a couple more shipping days but definitely keep this thread up to date as it might help others

    I also noticed when he took down his listings for his mdma products all the feedback associated with it dissappeared.  Is that normal?  It wasnt poor feedback but it does seem strange.  I will not order from this vendor again even if I still get my package due to lack of comminication (multiple unanswered messages)

    I'm glad I found this thread. I'm sorry this happened to other but I feel better knowing it wasn't something I did.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I placed a similar order with this same vendor who I had a previous successful transaction. My shipment was marked in transit via priority mail a couple of days later.  Then 2 days before autofinalize date I submitted a resolution for a 100% refund which was accepted soon after.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Answer at least one of my messages &amp; don't mark shit as 'in transit' when clearly it is not. I think they do that so you can't cancel your order.  Would it have been so hard for him to message me &amp; say, sorry man I fucked up you can try &amp; wait it out a few more days or I can cancel your order rather than letting it sit till we had to tie up the SR resources ?

    Wish I'd seen this thread before I ordered. It's been 10 days now and nothing. He responded to my message a few days back but didn't give me any info, so I still have no idea what's going on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This majorly fucked up my vacation plans, but that's what I get for not doing my homework. At least it was a small order.

    Okay. My situation turned out to be 100% the fault of the postal service. Somebody somewhere along the line sent it down the wrong chute and it got to do the grand tour of it's home state before it got to me, but my envelop came today.
