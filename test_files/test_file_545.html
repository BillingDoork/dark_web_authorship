    Right, this is a random throw-away account because it has some personally identifiable information, but it's important and accurate none-the-less.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm a Royal Mail employee- there's about 40K of us so that doesn't narrow things down too much- and as a result of certain.. occurrences.. over the last year, EVERYTHING sent internationally is subject to a specific set of changes from the 14th of January.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These changes are going to affect several other countries I'm sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically, from the 14th of January, if you are sending ANY parcel internationally, you will be shown a list of 'Dangerous Goods' that are completely banned, and required to *SIGN* a declaration that your package does not contain any of them. In addition to this, all of the international depot staff, specifically the x-ray workers, are being retrained to look *very closely* for specific things. It's not any of my business what forms of stealth you use, but they are looking specifically for:
    <br/>
    -Any electronics which might have Lithium batteries
    <br/>
    -Any bottles that might contain alcohol over 24%
    <br/>
    -Any form of pills or medicine
    <br/>
    -Anything that matches a certain organic consistency- that's a result of plastic explosives registering as organic material. This would specifically affect any shipment of hashish.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, while some of you might have been intelligent enough to know that lithium batteries block x-rays and attempted to ship your goods using them, you will, from January 14th of 2013, be required to sign that you have not included any batteries. The new regulations do still allow for batteries contained *inside* equipment, but you probably will not find yourself with enough space to hide anything useful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, the Royal Mail will get very large fines if they do accidentally send Li batteries through and something goes wrong, so they will be hunting down people that repeatedly offend, and give them fines and such things. This is presumably something you will wish to avoid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, just my 2 cents. YMMV, but be warned

    Under the guise of terrorism they threw in meds too.
    <br/>
    What a convenient way to associate meds with terrorism.
    <br/>
    But it also means that all pills in the mail are now suspicious.

    The International regulations on Lithium batteries came into effect on !st January, and they are for safety, not preventing contraband. :)
    <br/>
    Lithium batteries don't stop x-rays, but they give off heat when crushed and this makes them dangerous to ship air freight

    I used to have electronics shipped to South America through USPS last year, but then refused to ship anything containing lithium batteries due to the high risks of overheating and shit. So i guess Royal Mail is doing the same now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wonder if this will affect letters, or just parcels, i hope the shit i order still makes it through.

    What a stupid thread.  the UK does not have xray machines.  Seems like someone has been taking too many drugs and watching too much ''nothing to declare''.  Terrible attention seeker.
