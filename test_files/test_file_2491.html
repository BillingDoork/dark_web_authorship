    Specifically crystal MDMA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's say it's just wrapped in foil. Would that work?
    <br/>
    What if it was in a plastic bottle (like a hotel shampoo bottle)?
    <br/>
    What if it was in a glass vial?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is assuming good packing practices like a clean room, gloves, and pre-packed crystal from another room. I could acetone wash the first layer of MDMA packaging, then acetone wash the external layers. Would it work?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next, I would have to go through an X-ray scanner which will likely be totally fine. It's just those darn noses I'm afraid of.

    Trained dogs CAN smell a MOLECULE of MDMA. Quite literally dust the human eye cannot see.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, they are also trained with thresholds in mind... if they flagged every single package they caught a whif of... mail wouldn't get anywhere ever. Further, the practices you mention should be sufficient to pass by them undetected, yes. Just don't be lazy, be meticulous. Change your gloves often - between layers, even.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, don't take this as 'you should do it' advice. I would never go anywhere where there would knowingly be drug sniffing canines around. When I lived in NYC we would stumble upon them in the subway at times... talk about unpleasant feelings and immediately changing your walking path! Haha.

    Yes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MDMA is in the standard training profile, and it's quite smelly to boot.

    "Wrapped in foil": No. I assume you mean 'like a leftover,' but just no.
    <br/>
    "Hotel shampoo bottle": Not tested specifically on a dog, but no. I just put a close equivalent in a clean shampoo mini bottle. *i* can smell it when tightly shut.
    <br/>
    Extrapolating: "Combination of foil and shampoo bottle" - no.
    <br/>
    "Glass vial": I personally wouldn't bank on it. Do you mean actually canned/jarred? That could work. O-ringed glass jar? Haven't tested it... possible. Blown glass pinched off around the MDMA? Maybe, once washed. I like the idea of art-glass MDMA packaging. MDMA incorporated into actual art glass? I have no idea, and I'd be curious about stability and reclamation, but could you post a picture for awesome if you try it?

    If by clean room you mean a "room with no drugs," then that's essential (and no airflow from drug-heavy rooms.) Clean gloves over well-scrubeed hands. Prepacked crystal in another layer, packed with clean / gloved hands. MDMA isn't soluble in acetone, are you trying to remove other contaminants? (I'm tired and stupid, am I missing something?) .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd go with: **Moisture barrier bag** (use the google to find these, they are handy for oodles of things, they are very easy to buy, many electronics and food preservation/packaging uses). Heatsealed.  Test the seal while washing under hot soapy water as per FarmerBob's brilliant suggestion; he recommended dishwasher, which seems clever to me, but hot soapy water can be done by hand as well.
    <br/>
    Then IPA it off and acetone it off, whatever, let it dry. Box and deglove.
    <br/>
    Do this -as close to travel as is feasible.-
    <br/>
    Time is your enemy with permeability, heat doesn't help.
    <br/>
    Surface area is also an issue, less so with smaller amounts.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a crude, very-non-guaranteed rule of thumb, if you could store tuna or wet catfood in it without even thinking about it smelling by the time you arrived, you might feel OK about it. (But I don't know the permeation rate of Fancy Feast versus MDMA.)
    <br/>
    My own test: would I pack it with four-week old hamburger that had been in the sun, then ride in a car with it?
    <br/>
    If I even doubt, then move on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You know how humans (some of us) often instantly notice the tiny slightly off white fleck in the bright-white wall because a piece of dandelion fluff stuck to the paint?  Or the almond colored outlet in the house that's 0.01% browner than the rest?
    <br/>
    That's how dogs smell. And they don't 'hire' the happy-go-lucky 'let it go' dogs for these jobs. Those dogs are chasing frisbees and couch-guarding.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Caveats:
    <br/>
    I'm obsessive and I'm phobic of prisons and I don't think other people should go to them for crimes without victims.
    <br/>
    I train pet dogs individually because it keeps them from eating the cats and the couch.
    <br/>
    Therefore I should presumed ignorant of the topic overall, I am not a K9 handler.

     I sometimes have small things, usually smaller than my hand, that I want to conceal for mailing or while traveling.

     I'm obsessive and I'm phobic of prisons and I don't think other people should go to them for crimes without victims.

     I train pet dogs individually and in club for scentwork and SAR sometimes, because it keeps them from eating the cats and the couch.
