    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wanted to share some information with you all (this information only concerns people shipping FROM Canada; although it can offer perspective to international postal operations as well).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yesterday I was waiting on a registered Canada Post Xpresspost package of 100% legal supplements (small package; 450g). The package arrived. Or at least the envelope did. What I received was an envelope that was cut with what appeared to be scissors on the length of one side, and no contents to be spoken for. Now this was very suspicious as I have a good relationship with this distributor as I have had many orders in the past with them and they were exceptionally processed. I was very very sure the product was stolen after the package was dropped off, as I have a great relationship with the owner of this company. I immediately sent an e-mail to my distributor to inform her of the situation. She said she had never experienced that and she immediately reshipped my item without any questions. Following this, my friend who works at my local PO brought the envelope to her supervisor along with my invoice/packing info.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This past evening I got an email that really helped me to relax. Apparently there was another customer of her's that had the exact same thing happen, and it became quite obvious to her that it was someone at the Shopper's Drug Mart retail postal outlet (RPO)* Who had stolen the contents of at least 2 packages (a federal offense). Apparently my distributor dropped off the package at an RPO that she did not usually go to (I know this is true, as the origin of the packages I’ve received in the past were usually from one of two locations, and this tracking no. showed a location I’ve never seen before.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *For those who don't know or those who are not Canadian, an RPO is a Canada Post drop-off/shipping center that is located in drug stores or convenience stores, which is run not by Canada Post employees, but employees of whatever store the RPO is located in. This can be an issue as it was here, as these employees are often young and have no idea how serious of an offense it is to open and/or steal someone's mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was relieved to find out that it wasn't a local postal worker that was opening my parcels like a kid on Christmas fucking day. Knowing several Canada Post employees, I know that it is extremely rare for an employee to blatantly commit an act that would most definitely lead to termination of employment as well as criminal charges.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So just a warning to all our wonderful Canadian vendors: using an RPO to drop-off packages can cause problems due to inconsiderate and ignorant employees of these drug and convenience stores.  &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regards,
    <br/>
