    So I ordered something Express from a normally reliable vendor. For some reason (vendor claims it was because local PO was shorthanded and packages were not picked up from blue boxes) this vendor had a whole shit ton of packages that weren't delivered within the expected time. He shared a TN with me that is allegedly the one from my package and when I tracked it, it showed that it never even left his state. At the very first PO after the PO where it was accepted, it was marked "Return to Sender". Tracking shows it going to a third PO in the same area (i.e. not where it was accepted and not where it was sent back to sender).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor claims he used the address I gave him, which was not fake in any way. THEN WHY WAS IT MARKED RETURN TO SENDER? I'm thinking that becayse he most likely did not give a real return address, which is why the package was flagged and has been sitting in a PO somewhere for almost four weeks. Now, I've called the USPS, both central and the local POs and they deny knowing where the package is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Supposedly other customers are reporting that they are receiving their missing packages, but I have no clue if they had similar tracking issues.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While I would like to get my package, I'd rather not do so at the expense of having to deal with LE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Suggestions? Frankly, I would be wary of buying from this vendor again at all until he comes clean with what really happened.

    I would leave the Issue alone with the Parcel itself. if it has never left his city and it happen to several others i would try to level with the vendor and work out a refund.

    This whole story is about fast foward. Hate to break it to you, but you got scammed.
    <br/>

    FF intercepted that package/used a totally wrong address knowing it would be returned. There was nothing in the package, and I can almost bet if you and the other buyers get together, it will be the same number he gave you all. Nice excuse to keep all that FE money.
    <br/>

    FF was the only vendor offering express the week kush411 left. Many people FE with FF for the shipping. I think someone got a little too greedy.
