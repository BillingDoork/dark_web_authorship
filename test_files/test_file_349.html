    I am debuting as a new seller on the road tonight. Id like to know some of the most stealthy methods practiced by vendors active or old members.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't want to step on any ones' toes. I just want to practice the best shipping method so all my packages reach their destination.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks ahead of time for the advice. I'm looking forward to this adventure!

    Exactly as chief said, do your research and order from vendors who's packaging is highly regarded by the community. It also depends on where you are shipping from/to.

    Personally, my favorite stealth package from overseas comes from reich. 8)

    I am also a vendor and made a thread like this when I started and got flamed like crazy, people on silkroad generally scream LE as soon as you ask to share info.
    <br/>
    My best advice would to order from a few vendors that are known for their packaging. Other then then I recommend vacuum sealing and using mylar bags. Also make sure you keep all your shipping supplies in a very clean room, if you are a weeds smoker I recomment smoking very far away from your packaging stuff.

    Yes, Reich's packaging is awesome. I ordered normal package and shit was stealthy as fuck. I read his 'stealth' packaging is off the chart.

    No stealth packaging, no matter how ingenious and pro it is, will hide goodies from an x-ray scan, right?

    It's only good for that quick visual inspection when envelope/package is opened.

    I would also say packages that you can open and find some kind of product but no drugs. So when customs or your mommy or whoever is to open them because they are too curious they find something weird but no drugs. So the drugs should be hidden very well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm also for GE's packaging methods, soo good that you cannot even find them in your mailbox ::)

    There are ways to hide goodies from x-ray scans, but they aren't worth it for small amounts, only worth it when sending kilo's of a substance.

    Not complicated, not even expensive, just slightly messy and a bit time consuming but very successful.

    The dog would most likely show signs of not liking the smell, ie backing away or doing something out of the ordinary, and in that case the handler may get suspicious. You aren't just trying to hide it from just the dogs here, but the handler as well ;)

    No it wouldn't hide the smell, the dog would just smell both things. You can't hide a smell from a dog by using another strong smell, they aren't dumb like us humans. Think how bombarded their sensitive noses must be all day every day in our world, yet they can still differentiate subtle smells.

    I want to be 100% clear when I say I would like to see the "NOT DRUGS" thing tried with something that is in fact not drugs, to watch the tracking on it to see what happens. Even if one package of salt makes it to it's destination without any funny routing, I think it is a stupid idea to ship actual real orders that way.

    That's why the Feds shouldn't take SR serious because we're too busy cracking 4chan quality(I kid) jokes. In reality we are just kids living in our parents basements. There is no possible way we can get ahold of these DRUGS they claim we have.

    Ok I'll put some serious stuff in:

    The best, absolutely fool proof, totally untraceable, guaranteed delivery methods are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1 Take a small XXXXX and XXXXX with it, put XXXXXXXX or XXXXXXXXXXXXXX inside your XXXXX XXXXXXXX then pop it in the post box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2 grab XXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, use an XXXXXXX to put XXXXXXXXXXX with XXXXXXXXXXXXX, you might have to wait a minute or 2 while it XXXXXXXXXXX for XXXXX, then pop it in the post box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3 (my personal fave) Use XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX XXX XXXXXXXXXXX and seal it with XXXXXXXXXXXXX or XXXXXXXXX but sometimes that XXXXXXXXXXXXX, then pop it in the post box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4 if someone wants tracking, XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX for about XXXXXXXX just to make sure XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, once your XXXXXXXXX, take it to the post office, don't pop it in the post box.

    The whole point was to let people know that exposing shipping methods was a no-no on the open forum, then BAM - you go and decipher all the blanks...

     Labels that are printed look very suspicious. so always hand write labels. slightly misspell a few words so it looks less conspicuous. Always use a masking agent such as coffee, hot sauce, or perfume. use express shipping whenever possible. and if possible use an outside company such as fed ex instead of USPS. hope this helps!

    I thought coffee was a bad idea... damn.
    <br/>
    I thought someone told me to cover product in hot sauce.. then wrap it in cellophane.. then melt marshmallows over the cellophane..
    <br/>
    then freeze for approximately 24 hours... then re-ROCK that marshmallow... into a super form. Then put it in a sock that you have previously ejaculated into for several years... lick it, stick it, then ship it.
