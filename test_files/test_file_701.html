    For some time now I have been trying to draw attention in the forums to improved shipping and stealth standards that if used correctly actually BEAT canine detection, yes that's right dog proof!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well I hear you say, surely if there is a CHEAP and EASY option then why are not all vendors using these methods and you know what I cannot fathom why they are not either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; WAKE UP CALL --- FOOD GRADE PE VAC SEALING IS VAPOR PERMEABLE AND DETECTABLE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES &lt;&lt;&lt;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even triple sealing permeates in a few days so clearly when shipping to countries like Australia when items can be in transit for anything up to 20+ days vendors need to up their game and improve their standards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what is the answer? well happily there are a number of options available right now, in fact some vendors on SR are already selling them, see the links below:

    All you need to know are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    * MBB - moisture barrier bags
    <br/>
    * Mylar bags
    <br/>
    * Heat seal foil bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some sources for these products I have found previously posted by vendor FarmerBob are listed below (CLEAR NET):
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://www.qsource.com/s-40-3m-scc-dri-shield-3000-moisture-barrier-bags.aspx (large bags $100 - 100 pack)  You can cut/seal 2 or three small bags from each large bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://www.qsource.com/s-39-3m-scc-dri-shield-2000-moisture-barrier-bags.aspx (the 3.6 mil bags are OK, cheaper, smaller, $13 per hundred)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alternate suppliers:
    <br/>
    http://www.moisturebarrierbags.com/index.html
    <br/>
    http://texastechnologies.com/moisture-control/moisture-barrier-bag/dri-shield-3000.htm
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It has also been brought to my attention that caution should be exercised when sourcing these materials to ensure the sale cannot be traced back to you
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Discussion on this topic has been going on for several months across several other threads, for anyone interested please read:

    A non permeable layer must be included, for example when shipping small quantities of powders the layering can consist of a few variations, it may be a good idea to dispense with the zip lock baggy as the zip can be felt through the envelope. The use of double MBB cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol to remove any particle traces is one very effective method. The final stage must of course be done in a clean environment to avoid transferring any particle residue to the outer packaging, wear gloves and discard before completing this stage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The best stealth is sometimes the simplest, envelopes must be as flat as possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands of others going through the system. If an envelope is singled out for extra attention it's gone, that usually only happens when a dog reacts to it.
    <br/>

    VENDORS ALREADY USING THESE METHODS ARE LISTED BELOW
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Please note that the vendors listed below are done so solely on their use of non permeable stealth packaging techniques as advised by the vendor. No other factors have been considered at this time so you are strongly encouraged to fully research any vendor before placing an order &lt;&lt;&lt;

    <br/>
    HOW IS MAIL SORTED
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When planning your packaging, take into consideration this procedure which is not specific to a particular country (only applies for letters not parcels)  -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds/thousands of letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. If arriving from a "flagged" country it's directed to sorting area A in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny, if from non-flagged country it's directed to sorting area B for normal manual sorting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. At the designated sorting area, all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and manually sorted, with the sorter removing anything that's oversize, damaged or suspicious looking (again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence). Over-sized items are sent to the parcel area, damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further (manual, x-ray or dog)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Once manual sorting is done, the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine, while going down the conveyor belt, a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find, these are in turn removed for further inspection (manual or x-ray) the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5. Any mail that can't be automatically sorted for distribution (usually due to addresses in the wrong format, hand written messily, too thick to fit etc) are manually sorted again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So using the above information, one case see that the risk areas are - the country of origin, the initial manual sorter, the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Country of Origin - The intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has "flagged' isn't made publicly available but one could assume they include - The Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, China, Vietnam, Thailand among others. As well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Initial Mail Sorter - Has to manually sort hundreds of letters at once, so make sure your letter doesn't attract a second glimpse. Ensure you use a high quality envelope, not a cheap one that's thin and soft and likely to tear. Ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside, and ensure it's as thin as possible and packaged so the contents cannot be felt if handled and so that if handled, it feels like paper inside, not a foil bag!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Drug detection dog - USE MOISTURE BARRIER BAGS! PE and Foil layered are the best, followed by PE and Mylar. You should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope, you've wasted your time and it will be detected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Final Automatic Sorting Machine - Make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country. Make sure your envelope is of a standard size. (see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use the above information and create your letters how you wish, if you still get any no-shows to a particular country, change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added to a database. This includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc.
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    HOW TO ENSURE YOUR MAIL GOES THROUGH THE SORTING MACHINES WITHOUT NEEDING TO BE SORTED MANUALLY BY ONE OF THOSE PESKY HUMANS (AU SPECIFIC)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The info below is taken from the Australia Post guidelines for international mail, and they're based around the specs required for mail to go into the auto sorter machines, if a letter falls outside of these guidelines, there's a much bigger chance it will end up being manually sorted by a person. (when you receive a letter than doesn't have one of those faint orange barcodes on it, it means its been manually sorted. This doesn't apply to bulk mail that big companies send out to 1000's of people though)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Recommended Envelope Sizes and Max Weight and thickness -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Small Letter -
    <br/>
    DL 110 mm × 220 mm   125g max
    <br/>
    C6 114 mm × 162 mm   125g max
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No more than 5mm thick
    <br/>
    <br/>

    ***UPDATED 22nd FEB 13***
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's great to see this picking up up some momentum and kudos to those vendors who have already started to implement changes to their packaging techniques, as I said previously it is a win win situation for both vendors and buyers alike at no real extra cost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been giving a lot of thought as to how to motivate and support more vendors to make the change as I do appreciate change processes generally don't just happen without a catalyst which in the market place is custom demand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To help get the message out there I am now mentioning the non use of a non permeable layer in all my feedback and reviews on the forums. If everyone started to do that then it would really help to raise vendors awareness as well as educating buyers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would encourage everyone else to start doing the same, so lets see how that goes for a few weeks because I have more ideas on how to push this forward but they may not make me very popular ;-)

    Great advice! Thankyou OP and constributors

    IME I've bought approx 90 orders mostly overses to the land of oz ranging from above 5g's to below in heat seal, vac seal, just in a normal bags and some orders litteraly just in the envelope in nothing. I think it matters more which vendor you choose to buy from! be carfeful and make educated guesses, would love this community to flourish into a crazy online marlet place almost every street-buyer gets their gear from (minus fuckheads :))

     also I figured i'd throw this in: for those who want some good MBBs if you buy the 3M 100-packs online you can get a much better deal than buying singles.  The 3000 series is best, but even the 2000s are much much better than any food-grade material.  Dont forget to cut or punch out the serial number.

     http://www.qsource.com/s-40-3m-scc-dri-shield-3000-moisture-barrier-bags.aspx (large bags $100 - 100 pack)  You can cut/seal 2 or three small bags fr

    Mylar is not the same as MBB (watch out for compliance with standards !) and you don't have to vaccum seal or use a zip baggy with it.

     Here are a few points of advice:
     <br/>
     Metal films laminates are great, if you can see through the bag don't use it
     <br/>
     try to stick with MIL-B-81705C orr EIA-583 Class 1 approved bagging
     <br/>
     heat seal it
     <br/>
     You don't have to vacuum it (vacuum doesn't matter at all from a diffusion perspective)
     <br/>
     use no less than 5 mil thick bagging material (6mil is easy to find)
     <br/>
     Test your bagging in a bucket of water (squeeze to make sure no leaks bubble out)
     <br/>
     Clean the surface (dishwasher)
     <br/>
     Use packaging that has never been exposed to or even in the same house as any drugs.... dogs can detect smells on the order of 500parts per trillion, a single drop of sweat from someone who snorted coke a day earlier is enough to set them off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     but if you do it right even the best dog on earth CANNOT smell through a good nylon/foil/PE laminated bag.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Good Luck
     <br/>

    Thank you very much for this information. We now ship ALL orders, big or small, with mylar non-permeable bags.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's soooo much better then vacuum sealing, which people already did since this whole mail drug trafficking began.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some other precautions we take
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - Make the mylar bag and letter as flat as possible.
    <br/>
    - We only send out letters with nice printed addresses and return address.
    <br/>
    - Nice graphic double cards so the mylar bag isn't feelable through the letter. Not just wrapping products in paper, which is also outdated.
    <br/>
    - Use different envelops/cards/return addresses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can't get anymore stealth then this.

    Nice information, but hey, can  you also show me where i purchase a machine that can vacuum seal those mentioned things, one that doesnt costs a fortune?
    <br/>
    All machines i found cost between 1000 and 2000 USD that vacuum seal mylar bags.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also want to implement these kinds of metal foil shipping into my stealth, but a machine that does them costs like 1000 dollars while a PE one costs 300 dollars.
    <br/>
    Not really easy to afford as new vendor.

    Didn't I read you could use hair straighteners to seal these? Obviously not good for the long term, but it could tide you over until you can afford a machine...

    As the post below says you do not need to vacuum seal the Mylar bags, as I stated in the OP you should vac seal once using normal methods then clean it to remove all traces of residue before putting into the non permeable layer. And yes I do believe hair straighteners can be used to seal, have a look at PlutoPete's listing in the OP for details of their system too.

    No special equipment other than a pair of hair straighteners or a domestic clothes iron are needed to seal my foil, don't waste money on a sealer :)

    Can I also remind any vendor thinking of ordering from me to do so from a clean account not linked to their vendor account, safety first :)

    Hmm but it's a bit tricky, not vacuum sealing, since there's a chance the air will make the package feel bubbly, not flat anymore...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any solution for this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    About the heat sealing thing, can you show me a (preferably european) site where i can order such a thing, that doesnt cost a fortune? (100-200 euros is affordable)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And now i get it I think. So like 2x PE vacuum sealing, and then once mylar sealed bag, is good enough?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for helping me improve my shipping!!

    a) be posted as a sticky

    or
    <br/>

    Have another read of the first page IMB, you should still definitely  use at least one layer of vac seal, only the final layer needs to be non permeable. Either that or use the Moisture Barrier Bags (MBB).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some prices are listed on the first page of this thread too:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://www.qsource.com/s-40-3m-scc-dri-shield-3000-moisture-barrier-bags.aspx (large bags $100 - 100 pack)  You can cut/seal 2 or three small bags fr
    <br/>
    om each large bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://www.qsource.com/s-39-3m-scc-dri-shield-2000-moisture-barrier-bags.aspx (the 3.6 mil bags are OK, cheaper, smaller, $13 per hundred)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Very affordable!!

    This sticky is long overdue. When I was new and trying to build my buyer stats, I got a pill from a vendor that was literally vac sealed once and thrown inside an envelope, then into a priority envelope. Kind of horrendous and this shit can't be tolerated by buyers. It's in the sellers interest too to avoid packages from being intercepted anyway, I don't see why the petition for a change in shipping standards is needing this much effort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd like to add and stress the fact that I would understand totally if there was an all around increase in the price of shipping. Most of us are risking varying levels of jail time, and to pay an extra few bucks to lower the chance of getting caught seems reasonable for me. I don't know how many other buyers are in agreement, but if you are, I think you should speak up so vendors will realize that they wont necessarily be losing money by investing in better packaging materials.

    Stealth is no more expensive than vac seal bags and sealers, you don't need to invest in expensive equipment, all I use is a pair of scissors and a pair of hair straighteners :)

    I hear on the grapevine that JesusOfRave (JOR) is getting on board with the MBB options and creating a new ninja stealth option, great to hear!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other vendors coming around to this idea?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will update the OP with a list of vendors who are adopting these practices in the next week or so, lets see how many get on board.

    Although I'm not a vendor I do my share of buying. When it comes to price I have no problem paying extra for secure shipping. There are vendors that charge a ton for shipping and then the pack arrives with only 1 or 2 vac seals and that's all. That kind of shit has to stop. There are also vendors that charge for shipping and do such a good job it's even hard for me to find, and I'm supposed to know what it is!
    <br/>
    I've seen a few vendors offer different levels of stealth at different price points, like an upgrade. I wish more would offer that. It would be pretty easy to set up. Standard shipping including 2-3x vac seals and minimal stealth is X price. Upgrade to MBB or similiar X + Y. Upgrade Stealth X + Y + Z.  It's a bit more ambitious of a shipping model but it's a start for vendors that are using outdated methods. Ultimately I'd like to see everything I receive arrive in MBB's or it's equivalent. In the meantime if I could at least have the option, at a premium or not, I'd gladly take that.

    An approved stealth list is a top idea, vendors can add it to their listings :)
    <br/>
    A couple of vendors have messaged me, but most vendors order from other accounts so I don't know who's buying from me :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can I make a little point about Mylar, Mylar is a brand name and it is not Heat Seal Foil, it is a stretched plastic film used in some foils and the name is now wrongly used to describe most metallic plastics :)

      I'd like to add and stress the fact that I would understand totally if there was an all around increase in the price of shipping. Most of us are risking varying levels of jail time, and to pay an extra few bucks to lower the chance of getting caught seems reasonable for me. I don't know how many other buyers are in agreement, but if you are, I think you should speak up so vendors will realize that they wont necessarily be losing money by investing in better packaging materials.

     Why do so many buyers want an increase in shipping costs?
     <br/>
     Stealth is no more expensive than vac seal bags and sealers, you don't need to invest in expensive equipment, all I use is a pair of scissors and a pair of hair straighteners :)

    I don't WANT shipping prices to increase, I just wanted to make it clear that I am more than willing to pay a premium for improved stealth if necessary. I'm just desperate to get an "improved stealth bandwagon" on the road....

    To incentivise this higher standard of shipping standard and stealth I too would be willing to pay an extra premium for this level of service to compensate the vendor for any additional time taken to carefully package my order as per the guidelines specified in this thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am not looking to hike up shipping costs but I appreciate change doesn't necessarily just happen and if this helps kick start things then I'm comfortable with that.

    I think I have mentioned we are hot on the trail of making this happen.  The ordered MBB's have begun to arrive and we should be using MBB on every pack within a couple days. This will be our minimum stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We plan to add higher stealth options as upgrades to shipping for Oz+ packs. So far, these ideas are about adding items you can purchase (to be shipped in your package) to help us make it all seem more legit. Fragile things that need a lot of padding seem like a favorite atm. Thrift stores and dollar stores may provide very inexpensive items. There may be issues with larger/heavier packages being harder to "drop off" though. USPS 12 oz limit for blue boxes is a pain. I may be saying too much here? PM me if you think I should delete some of this or want to comment specifics that ought not be on here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We would also like to hear other ideas for higher than standard MBB stealth. PM if too specific or whatever.

    Ebay has a lot of MBB's by the way. Many levels of quality as well. 3+mil scc2000 and better ought to be our minimum here. There are a lot of other sources than the known-to-be-good "3M Dri-Shield" (2000 and 3000). Brand name may be very important. Even the 3M scc 1000 I have seen are rather transparent and thin. I think they are good for an extra layer  when mult-layering with better MBBs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wonder how many bags have the same lot code on them. Are they spread around well or sent to small areas? Might they be used for evil intent by ebay sellers working against us...? The codes are near the middle so removing them:
    <br/>
    Solvent?
    <br/>
    cut-out and tape over hole with aluminum tape?
    <br/>
    Cut up big bags and don't use that part.

      For the record, the samples I sent out were all are more than .25g and less than .40g
      <br/>
      They were a bit random as I was in a hurry to package. Also, half the samples are dry powder, cuz I let the bags sit a day before vacuum sealing them, and the other half are paste samples, cuz I vacuum sealed immediately. Overall I am very unhappy with my vacuum sealing techniques for these samples and plan to get a better method for increased stealth. I expect them all to make it to their destinations though, or I would not have sent any, I just know I can do better than that. I would never send something that I thought would get caught. Ruining someone's drop off address would defeat the purpose of me giving out free samples for feedback &gt;.&gt;;

    I agree with all you say: some excellent points and clearly said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A vendor who uses this 3 bag method is ChemicalBrothers (for powders).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Those who used shipping as a source prior to the SR boom will know that inconspicuous is the way to go.  However, I would point out that dogs are not the only method of screening and I think (I can't provide any immediate references, so perhaps s/o can clarify) that some countries also use x-ray.  Mylar would give a strong image and packs could become an identifier?  Given the cost to train up dogs, I wouldn't be surprised if x-ray wasn't cheaper in some countries.

    Uk has automatic x-ray screening of outgoing mail now, to comply with the new air freight regs that came in January, so they likely scan incoming too.
    <br/>
    Mylar and Heat seal foil is almost invisible on x-ray though, so no worries there :)

      I agree with all you say: some excellent points and clearly said.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      A vendor who uses this 3 bag method is ChemicalBrothers (for powders).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Those who used shipping as a source prior to the SR boom will know that inconspicuous is the way to go.  However, I would point out that dogs are not the only method of screening and I think (I can't provide any immediate references, so perhaps s/o can clarify) that some countries also use x-ray.  Mylar would give a strong image and packs could become an identifier?  Given the cost to train up dogs, I wouldn't be surprised if x-ray wasn't cheaper in some countries.

     Uk has automatic x-ray screening of outgoing mail now, to comply with the new air freight regs that came in January, so they likely scan incoming too.
     <br/>
     Mylar and Heat seal foil is almost invisible on x-ray though, so no worries there :)

    That is good to know PlutoPete, I have added you to the list of vendors on the OP now too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suppose I should make it clear I am for the most part referring to small shipments that are sent via standard letter mail and as I stated in the OP standard letter mail is generally only ever singled out for extra attention if a dog reacts to it, there is no way any country has the resources to xray all letter mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do not have the knowledge to comment on larger shipments that require more ingenious stealth packaging, I will leave that up to the vendors and keep those discussions behind closed doors and off the forums. The methods proposed in this thread should meet the needs of most buyers on here ordering small quantities of powders from overseas vendors.

    Trying to make something xRay proof is another issue all in itself. I recently had an issue with an order and when I spoke to the vendor they said they used carbon paper to conceal the contents, as soon as they told me that I felt like saying well you might as well have just written illegal drugs inside please inspect me Mr custom person. All packages are scanned entering AU, trying to conceal the contents like that guarantees an inspection because is looks totally suss on the scanner.

    MBB's are sealed using a vacuum sealer, if you have a look on YouTube there are plenty of video clips demonstrating the process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Heat sealed foil bags are sealed as the name suggests with a heat sealer and/or hair straighteners.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mylar is just a brand name for a certain type of packaging, if you want to know more I suggest you do some research on the net,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For those serious interested in the technical details re selecting MBB see info below:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BARRIER TECHNOLOGIES
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are 3 types of barrier bag technology currently in use:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Foil/Polymer: The oldest and highest barrier technology. A thin sheet of aluminum foil (usually about .00035” thick) is
    <br/>
    laminated to nylon or Tyvek for support and protection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Aluminized Polymer: This newer technology reduces material costs. Aluminum is vapour deposited onto polyester. As the
    <br/>
    metal is so thin multiple layers of aluminized polyester are laminated together this way any voids in a layer are covered by
    <br/>
    the next.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Engineered Polymer: Clear plastics that do not use metallic layers provide limited moisture protection and are primarily used
    <br/>
    for food packaging. In the electronics industry their use tend to be very short-term for dry storage and clean room situations.
    <br/>
    Thes bags do not meet test standard requirements for MIL-B-81705C.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MOISTURE BARRIER BAG STRUCTURES
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nylon/Foil/Poly
    <br/>
    Typically, this structure consists of a 60 gauge nylon laminated to 0.00035 aluminum foil, which is laminated to heat sealable
    <br/>
    polyethylene. This is the most common foil/polymer laminate. MVTR for this structure, when properly converted into bags is
    <br/>
    very low at about 0.0005 g/100in2/24hrs(1).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tyvek™/Foil/Poly
    <br/>
    A structure consisting of Tyvek, laminated to 0.00035 aluminum foil, which is laminated to heat sealable polyethylene. Tyvek
    <br/>
    Foil is the oldest barrier structure, however has gradually been replaced by nylon/foil or metallized polyester structures. MVTR
    <br/>
    for this structure, when properly converted into bags is very low at about 0.0005 g/100in2/24hrs(1).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aluminized Polyester/Poly
    <br/>
    This is the newest technology for barrier materials with a structure consisting of two layers of 48 gauge-aluminized polyester
    <br/>
    laminated to sealable polyethylene. These bags are generally lower in cost and have become are a big success with medium
    <br/>
    to short term dry packaging users. For 3.6 mil materials, MVTR is about 0.02 g/100in2/24hrs*. Structures that are 7.0 mils thick
    <br/>
    can achieve 0.005 g/100in2/24hrs(1).

    If you have a significant space in a package that x-rays can't see into, that will be suspicious on it's own. I hear there are containers designed to protect photographers film that are available. I don't know how big they are. If big, I would think they would be very suspect. If you were a well respected artist working in the "lead sculpture" medium, maybe that could work? Such artists are very rare and probably dying of lead poisoning. lol.

    After about two months (TWO. Months.) total, the (pet, not police) dog can't select the MBB containing cannabis from any other MBB, on multiple trials. NO interest whatsoever. (The dog also can't select the MBB selecting Snausage-type treats for 2 months+ from any other MBB. So I do now know how to keep dog treats safe in my car.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So - unless you guys want to learn canning or tinning (that does defeat the dog, by the way, I've tried that) - go to the MBBs. If you can't think of credible reasons to ship something in a shiny metallic bag, may I recommend a trip to your local grocer/mega-mart for inspiration?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buyers: require them. Start asking. Want to see the standard go up? Ask for it to rise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For cannabis, cocaine, heroin/opium (this is complicated, but just go with it), methamphetamine, MDMA - MBBs should be a basic standard of vending.
    <br/>
    May as well start using them across the board, though.  For one thing, they give you the possibility of sealing things early; they appear to keep product in good condition. Home Ec 101.
    <br/>
    They don't protect  against a false-hit or a cued hit. If your package has been profiled, and the dog is subconsciously/consciously cued to alert, then the dog may alert.
    <br/>
    But they can protect you - if used with appropriate technique - against a true hit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's all from the Home Ec/Veterinary Behavioral Science department.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edited for: updated information. If anyone's reading, they should research further for most current information.

    The more buyers that request these methods from their vendors and buy from those that do will help promote the change over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I said the other day buyers should also start mentioned the non use of these methods in their feedback, both on the forums and on the main site.

    JOR that is bloody excellent news! as soon as you have implemented the new methods I will add you to the OP listings mate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bungee54 is also in the process of making the change over and will be using the new methods in approx two weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The writing is on the wall, the change is happening and for those vendors who don't your buyers will be taking their business elsewhere in future as already there are choices available. This isn't going to go away so I'd really encourage all vendors to give this some serious consideration now before you start to loose business.

    Yes, the upgraded stealth option will mean heat sealed foil or a mylar bag on the outer layer on top of the standard minimum double vacuum seal. We will contact you when ready. :)

    interesting question and one that my friend and I were debating.
    <br/>
    there is not one unique specific material in "these bags," to my knowledge, and used in too many other items (such as food product shipping - coffee/candy/baked goods bags, electronics bags, MRE bags, etc.) MBBs, Mylar, etc. aren't inherently illegal.
    <br/>
    alerting to a legal item is not a 'good search.' I'm too worn out to explain this right now- I bet someone clever will come along --
    <br/>
    - but, like alerting to paper, it's not a good reason to violate your pack...

    Has this thread been sent to all vendors yet? Unarguably the best stealth a vendor can provide it to make the shipment as K9-proof as possible. Visual stealth should be second to smell-stealth. The single most biggest reason why shipments get caught is because of dogs.

    I'm not sure what "EST" is, maybe a brand name? Just wanted to mention I am pretty sure the 3M brand Dri-Seal 2000 and 3000 (sources mentioned in related posts/threads) are SCC (anti-static) and MBB and a visual barrier as well. I am sure there are suppliers that sell to the EU as 3M is a mega corp and these things are often used by electronics manufacturers. They do have a worrysome lot# and I'd suggest applying something (a label?) to cover the bags safety warnings unless your stealth includes a story that fits with those warnings.

    Re your other question all international mail entering AU is screened either by visual, canine or scanner inspection. As you rightly pointed out standard letter mail is generally only ever singled out for extra attention if it looks suspicious or a dog reacts to it. All small packages do get scanned though so I'm led to believe.

    second time reading through this.  all around really good input and definitely deserves a read for all buyers/sellers.  hopefully not only knowing pertinent information, but making active change for all members.  buyers should be activly asking questions and sellers informing/redirecting to this and other threads.  this info is likely to keep you safe.  thinking back i cant believe i received so many packages with basically sub-standard methods ie vac sealed or none (same country).  its great to hear that a particular seller has great stealth on a review thread, but with so many new members and an uneducated public- misinformation could turn an individual's life upside down.  packages cant be unshipped.  all and all this thread has made me rethink who to order from in the future and or pay a little bit for the needed security.  i use to believe vac sealed was the beez knees and that if it was hidden out of eye it would be a sure fire.  -the more you know

    I will now favour the Vendors in the OP listing at the start of this thread above other Vendors.

    Vendors that go the extra mile with safety for their customers should be, in my opinion, rewarded with increased business.

    Currently I just pad with paper - thinking about picking up some very thin foam sheets to use those (+ some paper) instead.
    <br/>
    I end up with quite a thick letter, certainly more than 5mm, but you'd really have to be feeling up the envelope before you realised there was something inside :P

    Thanks for that bro. You get a + from me :) I hate that I offended the guy, he no longer wants to deal with me but Ive know more than my share of busted friends receiving and yes the dogs did get past the vac seals on one occasion at least. In my town LE is super fucked. On one occasion they stole half the weed which helped my buddy get a lesser charge. This was years ago long before SR during the road dog Dead tour years. These days I am a professional with a business in a creative field with a family who seeks cognitive and spiritual liberty that SR can offer the intelligent. What a long strange trip.

    I just wanted to pop you a question and ask what kinds of bags do you use to vac seal your MDMA?
    <br/>
    Do you use mylar, foil or moisture barrier bags? I am looking for a new German based MDMA vendor, but I need one that uses up-to-time packaging.

    I had an envelope come to me with the distinct imprint of a small ziplock because there was only a sheet of notebook paper around it. The vendor fixed this next go around. The sorters are dirty with ink and they will make impressions.

    Drugs dogs aren't as tough an opponent as the police like to make out - fact is they can't work for very long before getting tired/bored/whatever and they're eager to please the handlers, so they flag up a lot of false positives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The system is something like this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1-Handler spots package/suitcase that they think is suspicious but needs probable cause to search it.
    <br/>
    2-Gets dog, points dog at suitcase until dog gives the affirmative regardless of what's actually inside.
    <br/>
    3-Probable cause granted, search goes ahead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There was a study in Australia that found about 80% of their dog-based searches were false positives...

    Just got word the following vendors are going to be making to switch over to MBBs:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lexq
    <br/>
    MiMM
    <br/>
    Bungee54
    <br/>
    SpanishFly
    <br/>
    Sukey
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks to all of you who are pushing this with your vendors of choice, the more people who make noise about this issue the better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone has any doubts about this becoming the standard for all shipping from now on the writing is on the wall, change up now or loose business.

    They seam to seal well with a normal heat sealer such as the kind on vacuum packing units used for food storage. I turned up the heat setting on mine a bit as they seem thicker and a bit tougher to melt than regular food bags. If you read up on this, the vacuum part is mostly for making the package smaller rather than keeping the smell in, so, u dont really need a vacuum sealer. "Impulse sealers" I think they are called come in various sizes and quality levels. It is suggested in the discussions on the forum that the seal on the good ones is 5mm wide or wider (if I remember the width correctly). I have seen some shipping supply places carry them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aluminum tape has also been suggested as possibly smell proof.

    I'm waiting to hear back from another couple of vendors, LA FUENTE, INTERWAYS and EMONKEY, and recently added COCAINE FLAKES. I've mentioned these vendors for they were great to talk to and showed a lot of interest.
    <br/>
    Lets hope they use these Mylar bags, for we know success rates will go up and stay up.  I want to feel safe ordering an 8-ball of charlie. :P

    I realize 95% of the time nothing is going to happen, but in the off chance they open it up to take a look, would the stuff being inside a magazine or something like that have any effect?  I would think no since they already went as far as to open it up, but still when I receive a package that clearly has something the sender doesn't want you to see when you open it, I always think to myself how hard is it to throw in some sort of cover up?

    I personally don't see the point, as opening a package is usually done after its been x-rayed to confirm suspicious contents. An X-ray will show the product every time unless its been disguised as a legal organic substance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if you use some kind of X-ray defeating packaging it will just show up as a black space which raises more suspicion than anything and will guarantee closer inspection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The trick is to make your shipment look inconspicuous so it doesn't attract a second look and sealed up so detection dogs don't alert to it (foil bags). It's that simple.

      I realize 95% of the time nothing is going to happen, but in the off chance they open it up to take a look, would the stuff being inside a magazine or something like that have any effect?  I would think no since they already went as far as to open it up, but still when I receive a package that clearly has something the sender doesn't want you to see when you open it, I always think to myself how hard is it to throw in some sort of cover up?

     I personally don't see the point, as opening a package is usually done after its been x-rayed to confirm suspicious contents. An X-ray will show the product every time unless its been disguised as a legal organic substance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And if you use some kind of X-ray defeating packaging it will just show up as a black space which raises more suspicion than anything and will guarantee closer inspection.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The trick is to make your shipment look inconspicuous so it doesn't attract a second look and sealed up so detection dogs don't alert to it (foil bags). It's that simple.

    My stealth letters basically just look &amp; feel like they're thick with printed paper. If you were to squeeze them all over you'd feel they weren't totally uniform, but I can't see it being enough to alert someone unless they were really looking for it.

    I've had 4 of my stealth packages opened, out of many hundred shipped. They were all salvia products in mbb's or foil pouches so they weren't flagged by a dog. three of these packages were sent on without them opening the foil pouch and checking the contents so my internal packaging was obviously good enough to satisfy them. The fourth had the foil pouch opened and resealed before being sent on, I assume in this case they will have tested for cannabis and not salvia :)
    <br/>
    If i was shipping weed I would have lost one package, if i was shipping weed with no internal stealth i would have lost 4 packages :)

    Without knowing how every customs operation works, I would have to say yes.
    <br/>
    When planning your packaging, take into consideration this procedure which is not specific to a particular country (only applies for letters not parcels)  -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds/thousands of letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. If arriving from a "flagged" country it's directed to sorting area A in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny, if from non-flagged country it's directed to sorting area B for normal manual sorting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. At the designated sorting area, all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and manually sorted, with the sorter removing anything that's oversize, damaged or suspicious looking (again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence). Oversized items are sent to the parcel area, damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further (manual, x-ray or dog)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Once manual sorting is done, the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine, while going down the conveyor belt, a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find, these are in turn removed for further inspection (manual or x-ray) the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5. Any mail that can't be automatically sorted for distribution (usually due to addresses in the wrong format, hand written messily, too thick to fit etc) are manually sorted again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So using the above information, one case see that the risk areas are - the country of origin, the initial manual sorter, the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Country of Origin - The intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has "flagged' isn't made publicly available but one could assume they include - The Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, China, Vietnam, Thailand among others. As well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Initial Mail Sorter - Has to manually sort hundreds of letters at once, so make sure your letter doesn't attract a second glimpse. Ensure you use a high quality envelope, not a cheap one that's thin and soft and likely to tear. Ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside, and ensure it's as thin as possible and packaged so the contents cannot be felt if handled and so that if handled, it feels like paper inside, not a foil bag!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Drug detection dog - USE MOISTURE BARRIER BAGS! PE and Foil layered are the best, followed by PE and Mylar. You should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope, you've wasted your time and it will be detected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Final Automatic Sorting Machine - Make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country. Make sure your envelope is of a standard size. (see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use the above information and create your letters how you wish, if you still get any no-shows to a particular country, change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added to a database. This includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All the best.

    LionwareTradingCo, and Hookers n Blow uses MBB and Mylar bags, and has amazing stealth. I'm not sure if these vendors have been mention before, but I just thought their packaging was perfect. Not only that LTC's stealth is prolly the most cost efficient method as well :)

      does anyone know where i can get a sealer for MBB's. I dont want to use my iron, I'm a professional and my packaging needs to reflect that. But i dont want to drop a shitload of money on it if possible.

    Great! picking up my hair straightener today or tomorrow at the latest. I will also be ordering my MBB's later this week so expect my new super stealth packaging very soon. Thanks for the tips on keeping us all safer.

    Hi SR members,

    I am a vendor selling EZ-tests and currently also MBB's (moisture barrier bags) for safe shipping.

    PET/Alu/PE multilayered barrier sealable bags are much safer than plain HDPE!

    Great idea, but i would put zip-lock into standard vac seal, then that into the Mylar bag.

    Like the dishwasher idea, wont be affected by heat at all? Being a foil bag it should be ok.

    In all honesty, it's great if you want to be ultra careful, but unnecessary as a single MBB will do just fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So go zip lock &gt; Sealed MBB &gt; wash &amp; dry and you'll save a good 10 mins per package which can then be spent on turning the rest of the packaging into works of art (the address and envelope etc)

    Mylar or not, too bad you are a selective scammer.
    <br/>
    0 out of 2 packages arrived... and all messages ignored.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do not order if you are buying internationally.
    <br/>
    Your rating speaks for it self, at a now low (88)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In other news, upon speaking to golddust about using M.B.B, he has taken on the advice and already put it into action, which is quite impressive.

    Great news TGX.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's wonderful to hear about vendors upping their stealth to include MBB's. Obviously this will decrease refunds and re-ships.....a win-win situation.

    Once your considering going international, pop over to the Australian Buyers thread in this forum and introduce yourself.

    This is great news, its protecting us and our drops. I recently lost a drop because the last vendor didnt even vac seal let alone MBB's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So i'm all for it, and for the first time, i'm confident in ordering a little larger than usual... :P

    Food type vac sealers seem to work fine at sealing. I do do double or triple seals to feel sure of the seals. I turned the seal-heat setting up a little above medium for 3mil MBBs and would guess it might be useful to go higher on 7mil. So a unit with adjustable heat would be preferred I think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have noticed I can rarely get vacuum with the MBBs. I think it is because they are so smooth. I do a ziplock in a regular vacuum bag and then a MBB layer (or two for larger packs or extra smelly - probably unnecessary). I vac the first seal-able layer lightly to make the package contents smaller but not so much as to crush the contents excessively. We have been told in these related threads that the vacuum pressure is not helpful at containing the smell.  NWN

    In the interest of safety for all and without giving away too much about my procedures, my idea of safety:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    STEP 1
    <br/>
    Room #1
    <br/>
    Head to weed stored area - glass with two-way humidity control packs in each - you know the deal
    <br/>
    put on plastic gloves
    <br/>
    weigh weed in container on scale and place in clean food grade bag
    <br/>
    seal food grade with quality impulse sealer #1 making sure to get an air cushion in bag
    <br/>
    quick wipe with clean alcohol pads
    <br/>
    throw gloves into paper bag room #1 for burning
    <br/>
    <br/>
    STEP 2
    <br/>
    Take package to room #2 - small room with dishwasher and big table
    <br/>
    replace gloves with new ones
    <br/>
    hand wash bag and swab all surfaces with new alcohol pad
    <br/>
    swab impulse #2 surfaces with new alcohol pad
    <br/>
    place bag into MBB bag and seal at least twice
    <br/>
    dishwasher bag (no dry cycle) and swab all surfaces with new alcohol pad
    <br/>
    replace gloves with new ones
    <br/>
    place bag into a second MBB and seal at least twice
    <br/>
    dishwasher bag (no dry cycle) and swab all surfaces with new alcohol pad
    <br/>
    clean impulse sealer #2
    <br/>
    remove gloves and toss in paper bag room #2 for burning
    <br/>
    <br/>
    STEP 3
    <br/>
    Room #3
    <br/>
    new gloves
    <br/>
    Disguise package with business material/packaging - quick assembly line of stuff ready to go
    <br/>
    remove gloves and toss in paper bag room #3 for burning
    <br/>
    <br/>
    STEP 4
    <br/>
    Mail package - won't discuss methods sorry
    <br/>
    <br/>
    STEP 5
    <br/>
    Clean up
    <br/>
    Room #3
    <br/>
    grab paper bag with any paper scraps/gloves
    <br/>
    Room #2
    <br/>
    grab paper bag with gloves/alcohol swabs/paper towels
    <br/>
    run dishwasher on one quick rinse cycle with bleach
    <br/>
    Room #1
    <br/>
    go back and clean all surfaces with alcohol pads focusing mainly on impulse #1 sealer area
    <br/>
    <br/>
    STEP 6
    <br/>
    Burn all paper bags with debris in wood burner stove on site. Relax and smoke a joint, grab a beer, bang the ole lady if she's in a good mood and so on lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can you tell my OCD kicks in about this lol? It ain't easy and sucks a lot of time but I just have to think of it as my hobby. I'm lucky to have lots of room to keep contamination at zero during the process. I don't how or if  I would do it if I didn't have the space. I bought a cheap dishwasher off CL and installed it in a room just for washing bags. Never use the drying cycles! The more packages I do the better this process will go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm no expert but I really hate the vac thing unless I suppose I was shipping larger quantities and needed space. It really can ruin some nice buds. I use a couple of high quality impulse sealers and try to get an air cushion in each layer to keep the buds from compressing and to aid in transport abuse. The MBB bags I use are high quality newest style - won't discuss more sorry. So far I've felt like the Maytag repair man with only 8 packages ordered but it gave me the time to set up properly at least. Take care!

    I'm trying to choose between 3.6mil 3M Dri-Shield 2000 Series MBBs and 5.1mil Mylar bags (made in USA but that's all I know). The price and size is about the same and I plan on cutting each bag in two, so serial numbers on the MBBs are not a problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I understand Mylar bags are lower grade than MBBs but is it be compensated by Mylar bags being thicker (5.1mil vs 3.6mil)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would love to buy plutopete's 7mil heat seal foil (which, I assume, is the same material MBBs are made from) but it works out even more expensive than buying 3M Dri-Shield 3000 Series. Not to mention the time spent cutting and sealing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I was looking for heat sealer and it looks like hair straighteners are the way to go, considering not only the attractively low price but also because they give the widest seal. Is 235°C/455°F hot enough to seal 5.1mil bags?

    MBB (moisture barrier bag) is a general term that covers all the heat seal metallic bags and some plastic bags, and Mylar is a brand name that has been misused and now seems to refer to any foil bag.
    <br/>
    The 5.1mil will be superior to the 3.6mil, both are 3 ply and both will do the job fine.
    <br/>
    My foil is 5 ply compared to the usual 3 ply, I could only afford to get one roll so I went for the highest standard I could get. The rolls are used in manufacturing and the minimum order is usually about 20,000m so i've had to be creative with my supply chain :)
    <br/>
    My hair straighteners go to 220 degrees and that's enough to seal my foil so yours should handle anything :)

    Cheers mate. I thought Mylar refers to MBBs specifically intended for food storage: they have food-grade interior. There's no specs, so MVTR is unknown.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On your suggestion, I'll go with Mylar this time. Btw, the hair straighteners only go up to 235°C but good to know it's sufficient.

    Thanks for the detailed list of steps and ideas.
    <br/>
    I was burning my MBB and other plastic scraps at first also. After the first stinky batch I remembered why burning plastic and rubber are something I like to avoid. It may well put out toxic smoke particles and the smell might draw the attention of people in the area. Since the gloves are so clean still, you might consider passing them on to someone who could use them. If not, I just hope you will think about the idea and consider another solution if it is not too much trouble.

    Although a very recent (about five minutes ago)  convert to the MBB philosophy, I would strongly suggest that people do not skip the vacuum sealing step. Google searching shows me that there are MBB that are vacuum seal ready as well , and I would strongly suggest this over just throwing stuff in a MBB and heat sealing it or whatever. Vacuum &gt; no vacuum, regardless of the permeability of the bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In regard to the metal foil layer, which was my biggest concern, I was just informed by a very smart friend that the layer of metal on these bags is so thin that it is unlikely to trigger a metal detector.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    edit: My friend also points out that the metal foil can be an advantage, as packaging in a room with an ionizer present will reduce trace elements of the drug adhering to the outside of the MBB.

    Why? Please explain how vacuum helps.
    <br/>
    My understanding is a sealed bag does not require vacuum. If you properly heat seal it's sufficient. High vacuum can actually be detrimental by increasing the amount of diffusion through the bag. Please do some research on diffusion. The vacuum used in manufacturing plants is intended to remove oxygen from the container limiting bacteria growth, reduce freezer burn, reducing the volume of the contents and ensuring a seal ....not practical to be dunking everything in water there checking for bubbles. With regards to volume reduction, generally I need to add material to my packages to stop movement so unless shipping bulk quantities I don't see the need for a vacuum. Don't compress the buds please lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I first seal my material into a food grade creating an air bubble, then transfer into an MBB and seal, then into another MBB to seal. Each layer of MBB I test in a bowl of water for leaks and then throw in the dishwasher. Make it into an easy assembly line process it's easy. Do all of this in a separate area that no weed particulates have infiltrated - pretend it's a lab. Wash, clean clothes, ect. or you are wasting your time. Time/energy would be much better spent making sure the package has absolutely no traces of contraband on any surface. Why go through all the trouble doing whatever only to have a dog sniff the trace material on the outside of the package? I think this is where most vendors probably fail as it requires strict discipline and no shortcuts.

    +1 to OP, thank you so much Samesame to making us all more aware and safer.  I will start leaving notes in my feedback whether or not mylar or moisture barrier was used.

    I recently received and order from Christy Nugs and it was double vac sealed and MBB was used.

     Although a very recent (about five minutes ago)  convert to the MBB philosophy, I would strongly suggest that people do not skip the vacuum sealing step. Google searching shows me that there are MBB that are vacuum seal ready as well , and I would strongly suggest this over just throwing stuff in a MBB and heat sealing it or whatever. Vacuum &gt; no vacuum, regardless of the permeability of the bag.

     In regard to the metal foil layer, which was my biggest concern, I was just informed by a very smart friend that the layer of metal on these bags is so thin that it is unlikely to trigger a metal detector.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     edit: My friend also points out that the metal foil can be an advantage, as packaging in a room with an ionizer present will reduce trace elements of the drug adhering to the outside of the MBB.

    One vendor recently had 2 of his MBB packages opened and allowed to pass for no trace elements were found.

    He had just switched to using MBB's and was very happy with the outcome...buyer and vendor both win. 8)

    There are two reasons why I would want vendors to continue using vacuum seals. The first is that traditionally we have been using vacuum seal bags to ship drugs in and it seems to have been somewhat effective, at least there have not been a lot of arrests of people getting vacuum sealed shipments. I am not one for tradition, but I am conservative when it comes to security measures, and suddenly completely changing the shipping technique used leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I will need to see some scientific studies or some shit showing that it is safe to use MBB without a vacuum sealed bag before I change my mind regarding vacuum sealing
    <br/>
    being a requirement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly, vacuum sealed bags to the best of my understanding actually have vacuums in them, as the air has all been sucked out leaving some amount of emptiness. This vacuum should pull scent molecules in, and this must be taken into account in addition to the permeability of the bag. I believe, and correct me with citations if I am wrong, that the vacuum in a sealed bag holds the scent in in addition to the actual material the bag is made out of holding the scent in due to low permeability. We can see that MBB has very low permeability , even lower than traditional vacuum sealed bags, but I don't know how to compare the permeability of a MBB without a vacuum seal to the overall scent holding ability of a vacuum sealed bag that is more permeable. I imagine it is not so simple as merely comparing the MVTR of the two bags, however in cases where a vacuum seal is used in addition to the MBB I do believe at this point that MBB is the superior choice.

    Thanks for the video tip.

    I agree it seems like vacuum ought to help.

    This may not be the only place I read about vac not being very important to scent transmission through the bag wall - but I have faith in FarmerBob on this topic (from the thread about - Packaging methods tested with actual trained dog) :-):

     Vacuuming should make no difference, in fact on polymer bags pulling a vacuum should make the results slightly worse.  Stresses that cause any inelastic deformation or stretching of any type of polymer will reduce the crystallinity of that polymer.  Reduced crystallinity WILL cause greater permeation.  I know it seems counter-intuitive, but diffusion flows are largely independent of absolute pressure.  If you don't trust me (and why should you) then go to wikipedia and get to know the diffusion equation, if you can handle calculus you can handle diff-eq.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The reason I do not use PP, PE or any other homogeneous polymer is that COTS flexible polymer films tend to have a wide range of crystallinity and there's no guarantee that the PP one guy has is the same as the PP from another vendor.  This stuff is generally made for food and so there's no quality control on many of the factors that impact scent permeation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Moisture barrier bags are designed to limit flows of moisture and gasses.  They'll do a great job of containing heavier organics, better than any polymer bags will.  The ones i use are 7-mil thick but are roughly equivalent in moisture permeation to the 3-inch thick acrylic you see in bulletproof windows at gas stations.  The 3M COTS bags (the -2700s I think) are probably close to that in performance as well.

     dual beam x-ray systems cannot spot aluminum that thin.  Thick metals, particularly dense metals, show up very well, but 1-mil of a light metal like aluminum is less absorptive of the x-rays than the 6-mils of plastic.  there's no way a dual beam system will discern that as a metal.
     <br/>

     Bear proof bags are just 3M MBBs with a zip-line on them and then re-sold at an outrageous price.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Mylar is not the same as a MBB.  Mylar is probably better than a straight polymer bag but it's not the engineered material that a real MBB is.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, if people want to use polymer bags more power to them, I'm not a buyer here, only a seller, so there's no risk to me.  And I've decided that every herd needs some slow movers to feed the lions.  Otherwise the lions would have to up their game.

     Once again good job thisaintme

     and thanks Pine for the heads up, I probably would have never found this otherwise.

    This thread has been most interesting to follow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Currently, we are using vac seal bags IN ADDITION to 1 - 2 layers of impermeable material. Mylar's pretty freakin' cheap, as are glass vials/jars/etc. :D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We are new to vending, but have experience in sending sensitive materials through the mail and have received no complaints thus far. We are definitely open to suggestions from any of our customers as to improvements that would be desired. Safety should always be the NUMBER ONE concern when dealing with the mail, and it seems silly (in our opinion) to skimp on a few bucks' worth of proper packing materials... especially when the item(s) in question is/are SO much more valuable than said packing materials. *shrug*

    Hi we have started using MBB as of yesterday this is how we did it
    <br/>
    We only sell 2g &amp; 5g cannabis
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Put the cannabis in ziplock bag wipe it down with alcohol wipes
    <br/>
    2. into the MBB heat seal &amp; wipe down with alcohol wipes again
    <br/>
    3 wrap the MBB in bubble wrap &amp; into padded envelope
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We do have a vacuum sealer but it really compacts the cannabis
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any tips would be great

    Just to reinforce this point, not vac sealing weed might be fine but for any chemical sales it's a must, if an order is randomly picked up off a conveyor belt or in any other situation where it happens to fall into the hands of someone who isn't the end buyer if the order isn't vac sealed then it can be quite obvious that there isn't something right with the letter/packet when you can hear what appears to be sand inside. This is especially important for large orders due to them also having weight distribution as a flagging point, if you're buying 500g of some chemical and someone picks the packet up only for all the weight to sag to one end it sets off alarm bells.

    I personally disagree that vendors who sell these materials are listings in the OP. If you are suggesting that sellers prevent linking them to buying these materials I would suggest it prudent to not suggest they buy the materials fro SR sellers. I have no problems with such sellers but please keep in mind just because the market is on the TOR network and mostly consists of illegal goods seller doesn't make it illegal for undercover police to sell materials used for packaging them. I'm not suggesting these sellers are undercovers but you have to consider that it would be a very easy way to farm addresses which can then be watched after all, who else would be buying bulk amounts of MBB etc bags from an anonymous market and paying in BTC?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advise is if you are buying from said sellers don't ever use an address that can remotely be linked to you. I would say "don't buy from them" but I feel that is overly harsh to these sellers as I wouldn't want them to say the same about me for whatever reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Forgive me but I'm just wary of any vendors who don't sell anything that's actually illegal. But it is understandable from their point of view if they run a legitimate company/declare tax and what not.

    Vendors should always use clean accounts and safe addresses when ordering these things, this is also true if ordering mbb's on the clearnet as the serial numbers may be trackable.

    Honestly it is an absolutely horrible idea for vendors to all be ordering bags from people on SR. If a single one of them turns out to be a fed they could potentially compromise a shit ton of vendors. I wouldn't even feel safe getting these bags off SR sent to a fake ID box, it is just way too huge of an attack vector for identifying vendors. Either buy them off clearnet sites not linked to SR or suggested on SR and sent to fake ID box or similar, or try to find a local store that sells them. The last thing we need is all the vendors on SR buying their shipping materials from the feds, and I absolutely guarantee you that even if they are not yet, if MBB catches on and people are all buying them off SR, the feds are going to be the number one sellers. It is just a new take on their VPN tactic of getting all the people on a forum to use their VPN to identify them, except in this case it will be getting all the vendors on the forum to buy MBB from them to identify them. I cannot overstate how serious of a threat this could end up being if vendors do not take every precaution when obtaining these bags, and that includes imo never buying them off SR or from sites linked to off SR.

    I understand why you have to keep it all straight line, I've removed any mentions I made to several vendors in my original post as I don't think it's fair for me to call out several of the sellers here and not all of them because I'm too lazy to check all their profiles and see if they all could potentially be threats. Also I feel it's unfair for me to smear vendors who might not be aware of my posts on the forum or don't have a forum presence.

    Also good to see some discussion on the safe sourcing of these materials, there are many options for buying these materials, just make sure you do it as safely as possible ensuring the sale cannot be linked to you in anyway, stating the bloody obvious I know.

    As mentioned they are not.....but great to see a vendor asking.  Keep on looking and once for found, then get in touch with the thread originator,  SameSameButDifferent,  and get him to list you upon this thread.

    OP updated with more vendors using MBB.

    Vote with your coins when buying, this is now the standard for all o/s shipping - you have a clear choice when it comes to avoiding seizures by canine detection, its a no brainer really.

    I don't know if there is a clear distinction between MBBs and regular Anti-static bags. The thinner ones are see-thru.. 3M brand 1000 series for instance. I think we should expect the thicker 2000 series for domestic and maybe the even thicker 3000 series for OS shipping. The 1000 series would, however, be better than the food grade bags that have been standard here in the past. I'm not sure all bags that could be called MBB are opaque, but I would think we would want to make the thicker ones our standard here.

    3M 2000's and Mylars are so cheap I can't imagine anyone buying 1000's. I couldn't find the MVTR for them but for these transparent MBBs it's 0.4: http://aeropackaging.com/products/composaclean.shtml
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have nothing else around, by all means use them but there's no advantage regarding price, availability and especially MVTR.

    That's quite an odd outlook to take when that's part of the reason why the demand for MBB using vendors is here in the first place. Yes I understand MBBs block smell etc but when you look at it statistically the drop in detection usually won't be very high and so it's mostly done to give the buyer piece of mind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said I think the value of them increases quite a bit as you go into larger amounts of product.

    MBBs are cheap and can be easily bought online. To seal them you only need hair straighteners. It doesn't require more effort or expense than vacuum sealing, which everyone is already doing. And of course they block smell, which is a big advantage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other hand, thinking that buying packaging materials online will get your address flagged is beyond ridiculous. Of course only if you use your common sense and don't announce publicly here on the forum what you bought, where and when.

    I never thought it would get your address flagged. I'm just pointing out that wanting to buy them for cash is not unnecessary paranoia. Buying anything online leaves a paper trail, be it the card/paypal etc you use to pay or the supplier's purchase records. Sure they aren't incriminating yet but should the guy who wanted to pay with cash get caught several years down the line whoever caught him would likely be able to find the card/paypal he paid with and from that they then have proof that said seller didn't start yesterday but has been operating for years/at much higher volume that then originally thought.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Call that paranoid but the actual amount of orders that get stopped by smell alone in itself makes wanting MBBs to be used paranoid. I'm not saying don't use them but this is very much the kettle calling the pot black.

    Get someone you trust. Meet him face 2 face and ask him to order the bags for you. Exchange no word online about the bags or sheets. Use a fresh address.

     I never thought it would get your address flagged. I'm just pointing out that wanting to buy them for cash is not unnecessary paranoia. Buying anything online leaves a paper trail, be it the card/paypal etc you use to pay or the supplier's purchase records. Sure they aren't incriminating yet but should the guy who wanted to pay with cash get caught several years down the line whoever caught him would likely be able to find the card/paypal he paid with and from that they then have proof that said seller didn't start yesterday but has been operating for years/at much higher volume that then originally thought.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Call that paranoid but the actual amount of orders that get stopped by smell alone in itself makes wanting MBBs to be used paranoid. I'm not saying don't use them but this is very much the kettle calling the pot black.

    Use a prepaid card in a fake name to order and problem solved. I don't think MBB suppliers accept PayPal but if there is one that does, you can set up a throwaway PayPal account through Tor as well. I still don't see how buying with cash is safer. I'm sure it isn't. Some people just have a phobia of ordering stuff online.

    I think most prepaid cards have ID requirements to activate now? I think PayPal offers to act like a visa or mastercard. You can use Paypal anywhere credit cards are good, but, there is an e-paper trail. IDK about fake/throwaway Paypal accounts yet. You are "sure" cash is not safer? Knowing places we can buy them over the counter seems very useful to me.

    I believe ID is required only for reloadable cards. Non-reloadable cards have no such requirement. I think they're called Moneypaks in the US. I don't know why'd you want to use a PayPal-issued credit card, you'd definitely need ID for that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Creating a throwaway account with PayPal is easy. Just don't put any money on it but fund it via Moneypak. PayPal freeze accounts accessed from Tor but they can't do it if there's no funds in it. Or even if they did, it wouldn't matter because it's a throwaway account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can't buy MBBs locally because they're not a consumer item. Some shops should be able to order Mylars for you as these are commonly used for long-term food storage. Maybe try an independent health food store?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: I've been checking Moneypak website and apparently they can only be used to top up PayPal but not on their own. I think what you should looking for is called 'Visa gift card'.

     I'm trying to choose between 3.6mil 3M Dri-Shield 2000 Series MBBs and 5.1mil Mylar bags (made in USA but that's all I know). The price and size is about the same and I plan on cutting each bag in two, so serial numbers on the MBBs are not a problem.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I understand Mylar bags are lower grade than MBBs but is it be compensated by Mylar bags being thicker (5.1mil vs 3.6mil)?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I would love to buy plutopete's 7mil heat seal foil (which, I assume, is the same material MBBs are made from) but it works out even more expensive than buying 3M Dri-Shield 3000 Series. Not to mention the time spent cutting and sealing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also, I was looking for heat sealer and it looks like hair straighteners are the way to go, considering not only the attractively low price but also because they give the widest seal. Is 235°C/455°F hot enough to seal 5.1mil bags?

    Maybe a silly question - but I have to ask:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When we are speaking of 5.1mil vs 3.6mil - are we speaking in 1000th of a millimeter? Because there is no way those packets are 5.1 millimeters thick.

    Sorry if Im sounding dum, just that this has slightly done my head in for the last few days.

We would just like to inform the community we have finally gotten our hands on 2 different MBB's. Both are of very high quality and structure and much research went into getting the best ones possible. We will be incorporating them in all of our International and larger USA orders,  larger domestic (Canadian) orders can still have them upon request.

    Hello all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry for the delay. We have procured MBB now and will be implementing triple layering, vac (to stop the rattle), MBB, then foil outside layer in 2 weeks time, when our next shipment of MDMA comes in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We will announce this new shipment in our thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    It's not really, vac sealing compresses things nicely though.

    I will be using MBBs soon.   I've got some MBBs right now but they are not very big.  They will only hold about an oz of weed.   I will start using them as soon as I find a way to seal them.   I'll try to get some bigger ones too that will hold more.

    I have been shipping everything in MBBs as long as I've been vending on The Road.  Even legal or damn near legal chems that dogs don't hit on get at least a heat sealed mylar bag.  Something dogs will hit on gets MBB, wipe down with wet wipe, dry with paper towel between each layer.

    Hey samesamebutdifferent can we get on the Op? We're now shipping all orders with MBBs, we might move to make it optional in the future depending on how time consuming it is but currently it's on all orders. Our SR vendor link is http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d1bc04e932

    I have been using Mylar bags from the beginning, partially due to the overwhelming recommendations in this thread... But I have been using Mylar to send weed a good bit longer than SR has been around. :) Now I use it for everything by default: vapor-impermeable, good visual barrier, and pretty fucking cheap to have them brought right your door! I think the amount I use for most orders comes to 13 cents. We can't spare a little over a dime or quarter to send people their products safely? C'Mon, y'all! I'm sure if you raise the cost of your listings by that much to cover it, few if any will complain. Hehe :D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another one I don't see mentioned is mason jars: cheap, ubiquitous, great vapor barrier, available in several shapes and sizes. Again, why shouldn't we throw down a few extra cents to ensure the safety of our customers and the quality of the products upon receiving? I think that doing so shows repsect for said customers and materials both.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope this doesn't come across as preachy/holier-than-thou, but as someone who is themselves often a customer of SR as well, I want to believe that the people selling me illegal drugs through the mail are taking every reasonable precaution to keep me safe in doing so. &lt;3

    Ok I have just purchased some MBB Military grade roll Off Pluto Pete. It arrived a few days ago. I have read through the OP. It is very informative, cheers SSBD. I do have one question tho. As In the past I have been using food seal vacuum pack bags. Which i understand are not as good, but that are very neat and look good. And I like the fact that I can Vacuum seal stuff. (only cause its cool). Now when using the MBB for the first time last night I realized that my vacuum sealer did not work with it. The heat sealer is not designed for it. So I had to use hair straightener. Not a huge issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now my Question is obviously MBB is far better and I will from now on be using it. However if there a good method of making it look neat as well as it working very well? I just don't think the straighteners made it look very professional. Only I was not able to vacuum it so it wastes space with air when packaging things.

    Let's not get ahead of ourselves, I believe the majority of vendors have never heard of MBBs. Though I agree and very much appreciate the effort, it's not mainstream.

    I will leave this question to vendors using the heat seal foil, you could just pm Pluto Pete and ask them given that's what they use for all their packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do know you can buy professional heat sealers for the foil but they are bloody expensive! hence why many opt for the hair straightener option.

    Hi man,
    <br/>
    I always get a very neat finish using hair straighteners, I find that if I turn the heat down a little bit from maximum I get a neater look.
    <br/>
    Make up your pouches by cutting neat rectangles and folding in half, then seal both sides.
    <br/>
    When i'm sealing my salvia leaf i squash the pouch between 2 planks leaving just enough sticking out to seal the top, that gives me flatter pouches for shipping but wouldn't be any good for buds. If i'm sealing anything that shouldn't be crushed i seal a bit of air into the pouch.
    <br/>
    After it's all sealed i trim the seals with a blade and stick a sticker on the pouch, the end result looks like it's just come off a production line :)

    I hear there is info on UTube about getting vacuum to work on MBBs. I have not looked there yet. I think the issue is how smooth the plastic is (food bags have a textured side). I can crinkle the MBB and get it to work, but does not always look as professional or it may leave an imperfection in the seal.

     When i'm sealing my salvia leaf i squash the pouch between 2 planks leaving just enough sticking out to seal the top, that gives me flatter pouches for shipping but wouldn't be any good for buds. If i'm sealing anything that shouldn't be crushed i seal a bit of air into the pouch.
     <br/>
     After it's all sealed i trim the seals with a blade and stick a sticker on the pouch, the end result looks like it's just come off a production line :)

    While it is fantastic that some sellers are raising the bar, a major responsibility still rests on the buying community at large. For a while I have been encouraging people to stop the overzealous use of the word "stealth" in reviews and feedback, on account of the fact that people are too quick to herald a seller's stealth when it is simply not the case. If buyers say every seller has great stealth, even sellers with poor quality stealth will be ordered from under the pretense of their "good stealthing practices" and no one will the pressure to improve the quality of their deception. The problem is that buyers are setting the standard of "good stealth" far too low. I've seen and heard of some products which were ordered with faith in the "good stealth" stated in the feedback, only to be surprised it made it all.  Only when the buying community begins to declare the standard they deem acceptable will the plastic-bag-squished-between-two-pieces-of-paper sellers (true story) be forced to improve their stealthing on account of the business lost to their poor practices and the careful vendors.

     I hear there is info on UTube about getting vacuum to work on MBBs. I have not looked there yet. I think the issue is how smooth the plastic is (food bags have a textured side). I can crinkle the MBB and get it to work, but does not always look as professional or it may leave an imperfection in the seal.

    I heard vac sealing a MMB will cause the seal to eventually rupture, or open up and eventually permeate smell?
    <br/>
    Maybe best to just seal the MMB with product after sealing with standard food seal? Damn i know this has been mentioned before i'm sure... :P

    I actually read here once how some vendors packages were arriving with the mylar open! Scary! ...Not sure what they are using but clearly it isn't working!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I use a vac seal to seal three times, and then apply pressure to ensure that the package does not rupture.

    Make sure to make sure your mylar has been properly sealed if you are not using a standard sealer!

    I think so...well at least that's why I use it. Helps squeeze it together, especially if the person orders for compressed buds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I vacuum 2x and mylar once. I guess it just feels more secure for me. Plus the mylar and MBB are a bit harder to obtain, and as such I like to use just 1 per order.

    Even with stuff you don't want to crush, light-vacuume is useful when doing multiple layers of protection to keep the size of the package smaller (often useful - but not always) or to keep the size of the final MBB smaller and cheaper. I also wonder if we make a bag like a pillow and send it on an Airplane, how much pressure they keep in the cargo section of a cargo plane. Low pressure might pop a bag with too much air in it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would not be smart to ship a package to samesamebutdifferent with anything less than double MBB ;-)

    Nope, MBB's (Moisture Barrier Bags) is simply a name given to a wide range of products that are designed to prevent moisture from penetrating it's surface. A wonderful thing about it is that if moisture can't permeate, neither can air.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A MBB is usually made from bonded layers of different plastics and a "barrier" layer such as nylon/foil/mylar/tyvek. That's why you might see people refer to Mylar bags instead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Foil is the best barrier layer of them all and I believe Pluto Petes foil material has more different layers than what's normally found on the market, which can only be a good thing. Just be aware that you're ordering from someone who knows what you're going to be using it for. So take some precautions with regards to the shipping name/address you use. (sorry Pete, you're probably a stand up bloke on all accounts but people should never be complacent)

     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'm noting things down and taking notes all the way :)

    thanks pine, it seems to be getting some traction now judging by the number of vendors making the change, its a deal breaker for me now when ordering, no MBB no sale.

    Added Countdown  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP updated with more vendors for you to chose from including Lloydsbrothers, a good source of quality coke if you are into that sort of thing  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep making the change over vendors, more are coming on board each day.

    Excellent work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Great to see these Vendors on board.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Extrapolating the idea even further......wouldn't it be good if the Vendor listing (on SR) had an identifier indicating that a Vendor impelments the use of MBB's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This would, in my opinion, further increase the requirement for better stealth upon the Vendor community.

    MBB or vac seal, if your package gets x-rayed looking for drugs you're done.
    <br/>
    I have yet to see concealment that would get through an x-ray.

    True, I was nervous when I read the Librarian's request ;-) How about put it up both ways? If not, do what you thinks best for SR. I can take the "hit" as I think I'm getting too popular anyway. Top of a big list may be a bit too much attention for me in this realm.

    Nope, an xray would pass through MBB because its not dense enough to affect it. Xrays can pass through thin sheets of steel these days, but they'll look darker because they're more dense than paper etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You wouldn't want anything to ship things in a way that would stop an xray from passing through it because that would be suspicious as hell and would certainly be opened and physically examined.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For most intents and purposes (letters, small parcels etc) simply packing it to blend in with normal mail is the best thing to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're smuggling large amounts of drugs (kilos/tonnes etc) you'll want to make the drugs look like a different organic material than it is so when it does get x-rayed they think its whatever you've pretended it to be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EG breaking down kilos of cocaine into ounce-sized balls and shipping them within bags of coal or BBQ charcoal. Make the balls of cocaine the same size and shape as the coal and it'll all look the same under x-ray because they're both organic compounds.

    I hear at least some of the bear-proof-type camper smell protection type bags are a couple layers with activated carbon in between. At least one layer being MBB and a ZipLock top.
    <br/>
    The activated carbon is kinda spendy in bulk where I found it available. For long shipping times with very smelly stuff that could be worth the effort. I would get small granular stuff for a lot of surface area and to avoid a dusty mess when opening. sadly, I bet the carbon does look like drugs on an xray scanner. Two layers of properly-sealed 3M 3000+ series MBBs would seem like plenty to me for first class or faster mail, even internationally. Maybe you would need charcoal to beat the dogs though if they are giving the pack a serious sniff?

    I use a standard ziplock bag which has been wiped down with sterilizer wipes which is then carefully placed inside a MBB with a ziplock top.

    Yeah the ziptop adds a little bulk to the letters and can't be as good a protection as heat sealing.

    Such good advice and links guys...really appreciate the effort everyone goes to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For me I am now settled...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plastic vac as first containment and reduction in footprint.
    <br/>
    Into a MBB...sealed with heat.
    <br/>
    Then either a standard business envelope with a printed label for small quantities - that is fairly easy and I think quite secure.
    <br/>
    Or a jiffy if it's a little bulky...
    <br/>
    On the last...any tips on additional simple concealment? Was thinking to pack with something else but don't want to draw attention with, say some old circuit boards etc...

    In theory, vac. does not keep the smell in better. It does help you know if you have a leak and can reduce volume and can change the feel of the pack. Different products and different stealth strategies make the answer about the usefulness of Vac. sealing a "depends on the situation". I believe buyers often prefer it for what can sometimes be mostly psychological reasons. We probably could use a new thread full of opinions about what vac. is and is not good for. Maybe:

    I would avoid liquids, things that seem like they might be bomb parts (circuit boards), DVD cases that suggest possible pirated software, pill bottles and other stuff that might offend powerful forces like drug/software companies. Could be good to do harmless, low-value items that USPS can identify by the shape even through the package - so they can feel smart about knowing what's in it?(detail omitted).
    <br/>
    Probably a bad idea for many reasons, but I wonder if they ever x-ray live animal pets? Seems like they would at least deserve the same lead blanket we get at the dentist :-) I can imagine my "add an elephant for stealth: $18,000" shipping option might not be real popular though ;-)

    As mentioned above, vacuum can be useful. For instance, vac can keep powders from shifting into a lump/bulge as easily.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got a hair straightener as a backup in case of technical failure and can report the one I got can get much hotter than is needed to seal the 2000 series bags and much hotter than any impulse sealer I have tried so far (only one). It might even be better for small bags with a top that is not as wide as the hot part of the straightener is long (around 4 inches). If you are going to do a lot of them, though, a sealer you can lean your weight onto may turn out to be more enjoyable than one you theoretically need to squeeze repetitively with a hand or two.
    <br/>
    Mine does claim to be one of the hottest.

     As mentioned above, vacuum can be useful. For instance, vac can keep powders from shifting into a lump/bulge as easily.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I got a hair straightener as a backup in case of technical failure and can report the one I got can get much hotter than is needed to seal the 2000 series bags and much hotter than any impulse sealer I have tried so far (only one). It might even be better for small bags with a top that is not as wide as the hot part of the straightener is long (around 4 inches). If you are going to do a lot of them, though, a sealer you can lean your weight onto may turn out to be more enjoyable than one you theoretically need to squeeze repetitively with a hand or two.
     <br/>
     Mine does claim to be one of the hottest.

    Thanks for the info Nugz!
    <br/>
    I have been a buyer here since the beginning and have seen every possible shipping method and never had a lost package(except min(ouch)). I just want to be safe and secure for the buyers without trying 10 different methods. The time factor for packaging is important as well for me, as I have a excellent product source but also a busy life. I don't mind spending on equipment to seal but also do not want to over do it with five layers of plastic and foil.   As I am sure you and others do.

    Yes they can be sealed with a hair straightener :) Just get a good brand one that heats up good!
    <br/>
    You can start buy getting a gallon or 5 litre bottle of IPA and some ziplock bags.
    <br/>
    1. place your merchandise in ziplock
    <br/>
    1.1 (optional) you can press the bag and merchandise flat if you want
    <br/>
    2. close ziplock and wipe with paper moistened with IPA and let evaporate
    <br/>
    3. place in MBB and seal
    <br/>
    4. Wipe with paper towel moistened with IPA or wash in a dishwasher
    <br/>
    5. (optional) apply another layer of MBB and repeat step 4

    We implemented the use of thick layer MBB Mylar bags 3 weeks ago, we use one layer vac seal and one layer MBB, works a charm I think, makes the packages thicker though. But in all honesty we weren´t getting enough lost packages to tell the difference. The scammers still try it though ;)

    Just experimented with the 3m 3"x5" 2000 mbb bags and my wife's hair straightener set on medium.
    <br/>
    I poured some strong perfume into a small ziplock and a perfume soaked tissue, heated/sealed the open end, and wiped it with ipa.
    <br/>
    Then put it under a weight in the sink.
    <br/>
    After 30 minutes under water I pulled it out and you cannot smell a damn thing. Pretty amazing.
    <br/>
    I also put one under water for 30 mins with a dry tissue and it came out perfectly dry.
    <br/>
    The time it takes to prepare these is a fraction of vac seal. I plan on shipping small amounts of powder/flattened rocks, so I do not feel that a vac seal will help conceal anything.
    <br/>
    I plan on double layering these for customers.
    <br/>
    Anyone disagree?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One additional note: These bags have a "lot" number printed that comes off when wiped with alcohol but it is indented into the foil. My solution is to just cut the bag off at the lot number and use that as the seal point.

    The 3m mbb bags work great if you hold it down flat with one hand and let the open end hang off the edge of a flat surface/table while crimping the open end with a hair straightener. Mine come out nice and flat with no "bubble" in the middle.

    Someone said UTube had videos with how-to on that. I have not checked. I was able to get them to work with a crinkle strategy, but it left a crinkle I did not trust or think looked "pro". Might try one of the tiny coffee stirrer straws some markets have out with the coffee? Crushing the contents can get kinda close to vacuumed if such crushing works for your product. Also, vac. is not really needed for smell containment - as has been mentioned in many of these threads.

    Most computer cards are in the thinner, see-through type (like scc 1000) static bags.
    <br/>
    For smell control, I think they are a lot better than food bags, though, not top of the line. Maybe, double bag/seal it.
    <br/>
    I'm not saying they will not see it, though. I think beating airplane security would be a whole 'nother thread.

    Thanks for your answer NW Nugz. Of course airport is a whole different story. However i was searching for something smell proof for checked luggage. Having read on wikipedia there are 4 types of ESD: S D C F with S beeing best (shielding). Computer equipment seems to be packaged in the low category.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will order some bags S type they are not that expensive. 'Better safe than sorry'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: Attention sellers!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    normal ESD (even S type) bags are not moisture barrier bags!! they are only for static shielding and are not smell prove!
    <br/>
    MBB are harder to find and normally selled only in bulk amounts (min. 100 pieces)...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for buyers security ...

    We would like to make sure we are recognized for using MBB's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We use at least two MBB's per order. We have never sent an order out without them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only proper way to seal them is with the Heat Sealer sold by many of the same companies who sell the MBB's. (~$70) Adjustable heat settings and an 8" wide mouth.  Sometimes the MBB supplier is a small "mom and pop" type shop. Stay away. Look for bigger reseller/wholesalers. Just my advice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Scrap vaccing the product as well. It only creates more surface area for oils to penetrate any bags your currently using (Foodsaver etc)

    As I said above:
    <br/>
    "Most computer cards are in the thinner, see-through type (like scc 1000) static bags." (these are probably the "S" type you were referring to - scc1000) I think they are more smell proof than food-grade bags.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3M brand Dri-Shield 2000 and higher are the real deal. Cheaper generic versions are out there as well and may be good - and - have no lot number. I tend to go with a brand name when it is this important.

     The only proper way to seal them is with the Heat Sealer sold by many of the same companies who sell the MBB's. (~$70) Adjustable heat settings and an 8" wide mouth.

    ULine carries a few choices of "impulse sealers". Ones will a cutting blade are probably very preferrable for looking professional. The blue one (16" wide, $250+/-) set on high is good for drishield 2000 but not sure the 16+" wide ones are hot enough for the 3000 series. The orange one for around $300 looks to be "pro" for our purposes. If you get a 16" sealer, don't expect 16" bags to really fit it well. Most bags are measured by inside distances. It is important to always press the impulse sealers down for a couple seconds after the heating light turns off - unless you have it set a bit too hot for speed.

    I've been messaged with some questions regarding my MBB's and asked to post replies here for everyone :)
    <br/>
    The Military grade foil is made using 5 layers of materials compared to 3 layers for the usual foil bags, this makes it considerably stonger than the ready made bags but it doesn't really improve smell protection as they all provide total smellproofing :)
    <br/>
    All my listed MBB's are the same, but the term MBB covers a wide range of products with a wide range of protection. The lowest protection is just plastic like vacuum bags, then metallic plastic which looks like very shiny metal but is really a coated plastic and these can be seen through if held up to the light. Then comes the usual 3ply foil bags which are 2 layers of plastic/nylon and one layer of aluminium and finally the Military Grade Foil which has 4 different plastic/nylon layers and one aluminium layer.
    <br/>
    The width of the seals vary between 5mm and 10mm, the smaller size bags having the thinnest seals, I don't have time to measure the internal dimensions of all the bags but as an example i'll measure one size.
    <br/>
    The 8cm x 12cm bag actually measures 81mm x 121.5mm. The bottom seal is 10mm, one side seam is 7.5mm and the other side seam is 5.5mm. The internal measurement is 68mm, the other internal measurement is governed by how wide a seal you use to close the bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is a very simplified breakdown and doesn't take into account the various types of plastic used, but it should suffice to give you a general idea :)

    If it did that in itself would be a problem as any 'shadows' on the x-ray will result in further inspection. MBB keeps the dogs off the scent thus drastically reducing the chances of your letter mail getting put through the scanners. If it gets singled out for a closer look then you would need some ninja level internal stealth to beat customs and good luck with that.

    Hey guys!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wanted to let you all know that our vendor account, Purptree4me, sends bulk pot listings using heat seal foil. We have been EXTREMELY happy with the results! Thank you all that put in the work on this thread to make it possible. This information has been invaluable to us, and makes the process more reliable. Thanks again!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SSBD, If you could add us to the front page, we'd really appreciate it. We will have reviews up by Monday-Tuesday we hope that will verify this on the receiving end :)

    Good news...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not only satisfied with triple packing and MBB...have now taken full advice and research on the quality bags out there and had a nice big box arrive full of 3M 2000 :) yeah!! Very happy...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, can now fully subscribe to bag, 3M MBB, second vac seal bag...then into the envelope/package....etc etc

    Whats the point in a vac seal around the MBB? It just seems a waste of time and resources to us, the MBB stops aroma/moisture so what point is there in another seal around it unless you've not sealed the MBB right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We not knocking you just want to know if there's an actual reason so we judge if we should move to it too.

    Hi - the MBB doesn't vac in my process, so the added vac is simply a "wrapping" which gently (the important word) compresses the shipment - many like light compression on weed and the preservation of flake/rock on coke...this method seems to strike a good balance...the added layer of plastic also disguises the smaller MBB to the exact size of my packaging (improving stealth in my opinion)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that makes sense...I vary the process occasionally to try new ideas - my covert packaging is really innovative... ;)

    When I created this sticky several months ago I had no idea a time would come when vendors were conversing over the finer points of MBB vrs vac seal combos and there would be 30+ vendors listed in the OP using safer shipping methods, what an awesome community we have here  :)

    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is my plan, I am going to use to use the following packing method:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Outer case: http://www.kitepackaging.co.uk/scp/postal-envelopes/cd-and-dvd-mailing-boxes/
    <br/>
    Inner Case: Standard DVD case
    <br/>
    DVD Case Document clip: 3m double barrier bag (air tight)
    <br/>
    DVD Case DVD clip: Free DVD (porn,os,game ... whatever)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am selling green, how would you rate this as a stealh package? it does fit within  the size and weight constraints in the first post on here

    <br/>
    <br/>
    and the list just keeps on growing... the list of vendors who do not use MBB will soon be shorter than the list of those who do!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MBB is the standard now, do not accept anything less.

    New vendor here by the name of Cork1Screw and I'd like to join the club. I'm offering high quality organic weed within the u.s. All of my packages will be shipped with a minimum of one layer of MBB, with the option for a double layer for an additional $0.75~

    We can relate to this post, and thought we'd share our experiences for other vendors using MBBs. We use  heat seal foil, but assume it is the same idea for all heat sealed materials. To properly seal make sure the seal is atleast a 1/2 - 1 inch thick. We trim it down a bit from there to make the edges look nicer but you want to have a sturdy edge to work off of. Any wrinkles or creases in the bag on either side can create pockets of air which might allow smell to get through. Heating over these does seal them, but we aren't convinced it's the same. Make sure to take the time to line up the fabric so there will be no room for error. Hope this helps, and people needing more personal assistance can feel free to message us, we don't mind helping you out with whatever advice we can offer.

    Finally reached 50 posts and we would like to officially be added to the list of vendors using MBBs.  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We've been using two layers of MBBs where one of them is the Heat Seal Foil - Military Grade 1m x 1m: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3e10560aef which is also the best one available at the moment as can be seen here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.msg1205751#msg1205751 We only ship domestically within Sweden at the moment but we plan to further our range when we have enough packaging experience and enough envelope/parcel types to not risk profiling - we will most likely add a third MBB layer as default for any non-domestic orders then.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would say after having worked with this material for a while the only possible drawbacks are user generated. In other words, bad seals due to bad sealing equipment and bad procedures for packaging which might lead to drug residue getting on the outside of a MBB are the only problems as far as I see it. From my thread Drug Imitation Materials: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173839.msg1249906#msg1249906 catalan got me thinking we've might not have considered the drug residue issue to the fullest extent, we will try and implement some procedure involving using isotropic alcohol as suggested by samesamebutdifferent in http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.msg807256#msg807256 to solve this problem.  ;)

    Hey SSBD,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been a Marijuana vendor on the road for about two months now. All my packages are sealed with one mylar layer over two food grade plastic layers with the option for the buyer to buy as many as they like. I've had people get 8 extra layers, so 9 in total.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So far I have 100% feedback rating and everyone says my stealth is top notch. This is a review from today
    <br/>
    "Stealth: 5/5 I'm always more hesitant ordering bud, but Jenkins knows what he's doing and has it down to a science. The first vendor I ordered had some good stealth, but now I know what great stealth is.."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's my page, I'd love to be added to the group.

    Currently got these bad boys (MBB's) en route for the MDMA, BHO, &amp; Coke samples I'll be sending out soon!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plan on alcohol wiping, multiple layers of vac seals, and MBB's to top off every pack!

    No successful deliveries yet, but I will be sending Monday's BHO sample packs out with only vac seals, by the time my MDMA gets here (very soon) I will be MBB'ing everything as my current MBB order will be in!

    Just a simple question - why double seal MBB? (if it is a quality bag such as 3M and sealed correctly, I can not understand the advantage of a second bag - it surely creates more bulk and compromises covert packaging?)\

    I don't think there's an advantage EXCEPT if you go like this:
    <br/>
    you seal the first pack,
    <br/>
    then you wash the pack to remove all possible impurities/smell/traces of whatever
    <br/>
    then you repack in a second layer (with gloves/mouthpiece, in a different room and with a different sealing machine)

    Thanks RaFaeL5...but as a vendor who already vocs the internal product (to keep fresh, flat and sealed nicely...) then places inside MBB - sealing and cleaning the exterior of both (the final clean in a new environment)...I fail to see any reason to double that final MBB...in fact to me the addition of bulk to the package undermines the stealth itself in many respects.

    My point is that a single, well sealed, cleaned MBB is more than sufficient at doing the job it's designed to do. The rest seems overkill to me (unless I'm missing something)

    I can see both sides of that 1 vs 2 later argument. Overseas letters that need to be flat may only accept one mbb that is exceptionally cleaned.
    <br/>
    Thoughts?
    <br/>
    I just do two layers because I send thick priority envs and two is better than one with a good alcohol bath between layers. I have separate bowls of a strong iso alcohol/water mixture and then a good rub down with iso soaked paper towels. I think I have a good system with 3 separate packaging areas and a shit load of heavy duty gloves. Gonna have to raise prices just for the cost of nytrile gloves.  ;)
    <br/>
    Any more advice?

    Agreed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Key points being well-sealed, well-cleaned. This is where I'm not so sure the flat-irons make the grade for sealing, by the way, but I've never tested them in the dishwasher, etc. Has anyone?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's not something that someone's willing to hold under hot water (or, FarmerBob's suggestion: through the dishwasher) - then it's not well-sealed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For messy / fluffy things, I can see sealing into another bag (as you describe) before dropping into MBB/odor blocking bag, for sheer ease of handling if nothing else. When I tried with glow-dust to keep from contaminating outside layer, even being pretty good at clean technique, it was almost impossible without that internal layer, at least with the flour-glowdust combination I was using. That containment bag (not full on odor-proof) also kept everything from floofing out when I opened external layer in a big glow-cloud.  [If you want to know how to glitterbomb someone in the mail, though....]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One layer of bag tests out pretty damn well (check the literature as well. Seems practical to save extra money for things like nitrile gloves, drugs, family, and EFF.

     If it's not something that someone's willing to hold under hot water (or, FarmerBob's suggestion: through the dishwasher) - then it's not well-sealed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For messy / fluffy things, I can see sealing into another bag (as you describe) before dropping into MBB/odor blocking bag, for sheer ease of handling if nothing else. When I tried with glow-dust to keep from contaminating outside layer, even being pretty good at clean technique, it was almost impossible without that internal layer, at least with the flour-glowdust combination I was using. That containment bag (not full on odor-proof) also kept everything from floofing out when I opened external layer in a big glow-cloud.  [If you want to know how to glitterbomb someone in the mail, though....]
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One layer of bag tests out pretty damn well (check the literature as well. Seems practical to save extra money for things like nitrile gloves, drugs, family, and EFF.

    Absolutely....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess my question was if the MBB is suited to the job (which I believe it is and certainly delivers good results for me) what is the advantage of a second? @ Kirby12 - thanks for the response, but surely it is the international traffic through customs which would be of most benefit to double layering (it this is advantageous of course) as with domestic I think it's way OTT personally...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good discussions though and highlights to the community how important good quality control is at the vendor end.

    You can see the changing trends in packaging as a buyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A first, triple vac was accepted for bud, hash, usually gets a layer around it which seals in odour for the most part. Heat can set it off though and if you send a thermometer with highest and lowest temp settings, via the mail, you may see some high temps and lows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first MBB packaging I got was from The Scurvy Crew. Now, most bud/weed comes via this method. Not bought anything else of late but I imagine coke is MBB with the top vendors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some of the MBB has a seal included. A zip style opening. The idea is to seal above the zip, locking in the odour. You snip off below the seal and have a nice free reusable MBB. Every little helps! I use those for festivals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason people seal twice is simple. The first sealing is usually done with hands that then transfer the odour to the bag. My solution would be to wipe each bag down with alcohol (isopropanol is cheap.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The WORSE thing to tackle is one of the least harmful drugs, good old stinking bud! Some of this is so powerful in smell that you may need to use two charcoal filters growing it. Some smells like carrion! One bud up our way is called, lol, 'death bud'. Smells real bad but tastes real good plus its very strong.  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I may be wrong, but cannabis seems to be the hardest drug to not only preven the smell of - we also like it uncompressed. If you want your bud in an envelope through the door (I like it that way) and not have to pick it up at the post office, it needs to be broken up a little. take the tiny nuggets off the buds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vac sealing usually crushes bud a little. he MBB bags, you can leave a little air inside to cushion the buds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With powders, some have a definite smell, but washing most leaves for a fairly odourless powder.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MDMA for example, does not smell like aniseed after a good wash in acetone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That powerful smelling coke also, after a wash, you will not smell much of anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Speed, likewise. Speed that smell real powerful is usually still wet. Washing it leaves for an odourless affair.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bud always smells! Sure some is not tha powerful, more like a light perfume, but some of it stinks big time. A dime bag of bud can stink out a room with ease.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, MBB has to become the standard delivery package now we know that vac seal is not that effective.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good that vendors are on top of the game, or making the effort to be as safe as they can be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At least nobody is claiming 'x-ray proof' wrapping, a lie fed to people enticed into smuggling.  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And hello to anyone at Glatonbury, gave my ticket away afer seeing the forecast. I will go to the pub instead and have saved like a thousand pounds on drugs and alcohol plus food.

    Since switching to MBB's our success rate has increased noticeably. Ive used MBB's on hundreds of orders, and Im very confident that they can beat sniffer dogs.

    Just cant beat xrays, don't believe people who say they can!

    Read the thread please.
    <br/>
    - MBB act as an odor sealment. That means odors stay trapped inside the bag.
    <br/>
    - Dogs will react to the fragrances they've been trained to identify.
    <br/>
    - So if the pouch contains residual scents, they might be alerted
    <br/>
    It's the packing process that guarantees odor proof parcel.

    When you speak about x-ray proof packages, you actually mean prone to clear x-ray screening without detection.
    <br/>
    You can make x-ray proof parcels using (lots) of lead, you fool the machine, still the parcel get's picked and inspected 100%.
    <br/>
    What you want, is that the guy looking at the screen doesn't spend a second thought about the content. So you need to know what the policies of the country your sending to are in regards of selection for closer scrutiny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As an example, I had an envelope containing an illicit product that would alert dogs opened laterally. I guess, and this is backed by some comments I read here, it was for a K-9 screening. The MBB pouch was visible, but the packing process being adequate, it didn't alert dogs, it passed the screening and went on. I enjoyed that stuff last week. I they don't suspect anything illegal, no second look, no probs.
    <br/>
    Had it contained pills, it would have alerted the custom officer because one could see the pouch, and not because of the dogs reaction. Pills are easily discernible to the human eye, to a custom officer they could be counterfeit medication, he picks it opens it, the end.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So you can fool the dogs, the x-ray machines and what not, if you don't understand the process as a whole, you won't get far. All in all, you would rather make sure your parcel doesn't get x-rayed, than to find a way to have it look inconspicuous on the x-ray screen.

    Great summary and thanks for taking the time to cut it up into manageable sized pieces.  Dogs and Xrays are different subjects so let's keep them that way.  My interest is dogs as I only order domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have read the thread (many times) but I don't see anyone saying unequivocally, "yes, with proper packaging (MBBs) and proper post-handling (cleaning, scrubbing residue, alcohol bath, whatever).....we can take our package and hold it up to a dogs nose without alerting".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't misunderstand, I hear everyone saying "it's better" but that doesn't tell us if it's 100% or not.  That's the answer I am trying to find out.  Both for my peace of mind as well as others.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Guys - this is a *huge* deal.  If we can beat the dogs 100% of the time by using MBBs and following some kind of "cleaning" process, then we have changed the drug distribution game forever.  I realize LE has many tools but busts happen because of dogs 99.9% of the time.

    Going to test Pluto's 1m foil at a festival soon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll be taking lots of mephedrone (assume dogs don't sniff this anyway), lots of C and about 100 high dosed beans.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've bagged everything up into small bags then gonna make few pouches using his foil, place drugs into pouches, then get someone else to seal the pouch. I'll give each pouch a rub down with vodka or alcohol wipes, then repeat the process with another pouch. All items will be "stealthed" inside camping goods to hide visibility (any ideas folks?)

    You have your answers above, still:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Sure, my pleasure. Dogs and x-rays are different means of detection, amongst others, that can be discussed separately, but are part of the same process that should always be seen as a whole.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Correct.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. There is no such thing as leakage free material. There are emanations and residual scents. If you want to be 100% sure that the qty of odor required to alert the dog is not reached when he sniffs that pack, don't put any drugs in there. Still couldn't exclude false positives, reaction to coffee or other masking substances f.ex. Stay paranoid and sharp, that's the way to go if you smuggle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. This is utter BS. Busts happen 99% due to rats or prior surveillance (probably due to rats too). I won't elaborate here as you didn't pay attention to the part where I mention shipping/stealth as a (continuous and evolving) process, but please do not fool others into that simplistic thinking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again : If your MBB reads "1 oz girl scout cookies" your a hippy, don't have an income and ride a Ferrari, the dogs won't bother, still your done.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good?

    Lemme get that straight:
    <br/>
    You made several zippies of several products, you'll seal that securely, hide it and than head to your festival to get rich?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's your question here?
    <br/>
    - Will you avoid K-9 detection? Sure, as long as you don't open the pouches. If you don't, you won't sell jack shit.
    <br/>
    - Is it safe? No. You risk some serious time here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To rough it up: Plan how you want to smuggle the goods inside, where you will stash them, how you'll beat undercover cops surveillance, how you'll conduct the transactions (if that is what you want to do), what you'll do with the money, etc..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't plan vending, my bad, take less product, if you do, my best advice would be you stick to vending to your mates.
    <br/>
    Reading you I realize you don't need technicalities here, you need a plan.

    Of course the pouches will get opened, once inside the festival. There's only drug dogs at the entrance to the campsite, once your in campsite your pretty much free to do as you please, inside the music arena however there is drug dogs, so sales would be conducted strictly in the campsite away from our tents.

    Where did you get the idea that uk festies don't have undercover police operating? they have a dedicated squad that covers all the main festies and some of the smaller ones.
    <br/>
    My foil will beat a dog even if you hold it under it's nose, but if the dog handler sees the pouch he may well think it suspicious if its rolled in your camping gear. If the festie allows cooking get some foil packed food and copy the labels and packaging :)

    kssr, I'm doing the same as you I am in the UK, just ordered the foil. (apart mine is personal use amounts of MDMA/MDA/Meth and GHB only, my friends are also using the foil for their own personal stash)
    <br/>
    I know for sure there will be up to 5 police drug dogs there as last year a shit ton of people got busted for drugs at this festival going in, there were 5 dogs sniffing around, saw about 30 people get dragged away to be searched within about 15mins...
    <br/>
    So I'm pretty much relaying on this foil to keep myself and friends free from being arrested lol. We'll all strap the pouches to our ball bags/inbetween legs using tape after we have washed the foil with alcohol and put it in the dishwasher. May even foil it twice over if there's enough.
    <br/>
    Also, just a helpful tip for you guys.. I'm washing all my cards with alcohol to make sure the particles on them that have been from making lines is gone. I'm not even gunna bother taking my wallet lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My festival is next weekend so I'll keep you updated on how it goes getting past the dogs. I'm sure it'll be fine. :)

      Of course the pouches will get opened, once inside the festival.

     Where did you get the idea that uk festies don't have undercover police operating? they have a dedicated squad that covers all the main festies and some of the smaller ones.

     My foil will beat a dog even if you hold it under it's nose, but if the dog handler sees the pouch he may well think it suspicious if its rolled in your camping gear. If the festie allows cooking get some foil packed food and copy the labels and packaging :)

    Hey don't you worry, it will be hidden in the camping gear and he's familiar with festies. And lucky. He has it all covered, 'cos as you know, security, law enforcements dispatches or numbers and screening methods never evolve.
    <br/>
    Thinking of that, with your foil it would be a lot safer to unload that boat my buddy talked about. No way those pesky dogs could smell the gear, and it would be well wrapped and obfuscated, coppers won't have a clue.

    Hey, I had an idea for improved stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If there was a way to make small qtys (say, 3g and under) look like iTunes gift cards or other gift cards, that would be a good cover.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could potentially make it very inconspicuous under x-ray, too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other thing I was thinking too, is that maybe a rectangle isn't the best shape.  Maybe long and thin might be a better idea to break the pattern of what customs looks for.
    <br/>

    So many ideas..... 8)

     JB,

     Great summary and thanks for taking the time to cut it up into manageable sized pieces.  Dogs and Xrays are different subjects so let's keep them that way.  My interest is dogs as I only order domestic.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I have read the thread (many times) but I don't see anyone saying unequivocally, "yes, with proper packaging (MBBs) and proper post-handling (cleaning, scrubbing residue, alcohol bath, whatever).....we can take our package and hold it up to a dogs nose without alerting".
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Don't misunderstand, I hear everyone saying "it's better" but that doesn't tell us if it's 100% or not.  That's the answer I am trying to find out.  Both for my peace of mind as well as others.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Guys - this is a *huge* deal.  If we can beat the dogs 100% of the time by using MBBs and following some kind of "cleaning" process, then we have changed the drug distribution game forever.  I realize LE has many tools but busts happen because of dogs 99.9% of the time.

    There is a thread buried somewhere on the forums where some people test various packaging with a real drug detection sniffer dog. If your order is packaged in a clean environment and all residual trace particles are removed from the outer surfaces of the MBB it will pass canine detection.

    SSBD,
    <br/>
    Yes I have read that thread too and its a really good read.  However, it's (1) dog and it was retired.   Not saying it means nothing but I'd be curious if we can reproduce those results over and over against other dogs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I realize dogs are one part of a bigger system but I don't understand how people can downplay dogs and how big of a deal it would be if we can beat them.   Whether it's mail or other means of transport, dogs are the single most popular tool of LE and they are a formidable foe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (sidenote: I also want to acknowledge that LE is probably involved in a disinformation campaign about drug dog capabilities so getting good, quality, scientific data on the subject is difficult, at best.)

    They need to have probable cause. Simply attending a festival is not probable cause. However if you are rolling balls like a motherfucker and acting in a way that someone could deem "highness on some sort of a substance" there is a good chance you'll get searched. If they find something you will not have any say to the incident on was it legal or not to search you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a dog marks you = probable cause in most countries
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you act really weird = probable cause (which is good because weird acting people can be dangerous. The police don't care if you are high in PMA, PCP or just happy-mellow-MDMA).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's really simple. Don't be an idiot and you will have a good time. Also you should note that the festival security has the right to refuse entry if you don't give permission for a pat down if they have one in place at the entry point. It's a privately held gathering and they may apply their own rules.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: To answer you more clearly. They can search you if you act crazy enough. Please don't do drugs if you can't handle yourself! A little "happy mood" won't get you in trouble though. The drunk people there cause more hassle.

     They need to have probable cause. Simply attending a festival is not probable cause. However if you are rolling balls like a motherfucker and acting in a way that someone could deem "highness on some sort of a substance" there is a good chance you'll get searched. If they find something you will not have any say to the incident on was it legal or not to search you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If a dog marks you = probable cause in most countries
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you act really weird = probable cause (which is good because weird acting people can be dangerous. The police don't care if you are high in PMA, PCP or just happy-mellow-MDMA).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's really simple. Don't be an idiot and you will have a good time. Also you should note that the festival security has the right to refuse entry if you don't give permission for a pat down if they have one in place at the entry point. It's a privately held gathering and they may apply their own rules.

    Ok I'm not to worried about the dogs because I've MBB'd the drugs and alcohol wiped everything I am taking.
    <br/>
    I've taken drugs into festivals and events before where there have been dogs and police but at this festival apparently they will be having a massive drugs operation going on with multiple dogs and search areas.
    <br/>
    Just thinking of taping the MBB in between my legs and walking right on through hoping I don't act suspiciously enough for a search. OR I could put the MBB in a compartment in my bag and glue the compartment up so it likes like there is no compartment.. what would be a better option in your opinion?

    I don't mean to be a buzzkill.  This is why I am asking so many questions about dogs.  There are a lot of stories and information out there about what works.  Some good, most bad.

     Yes I have read that thread too and its a really good read.  However, it's (1) dog and it was retired.   Not saying it means nothing but I'd be curious if we can reproduce those results over and over against other dogs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I realize dogs are one part of a bigger system but I don't understand how people can downplay dogs and how big of a deal it would be if we can beat them.   Whether it's mail or other means of transport, dogs are the single most popular tool of LE and they are a formidable foe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (sidenote: I also want to acknowledge that LE is probably involved in a disinformation campaign about drug dog capabilities so getting good, quality, scientific data on the subject is difficult, at best.)

    Sniffer dogs are notoriously unreliable, often alerting giving false positives etc, they also can only be worked for short periods before their effectiveness drops right off. I've walked right past sniffer dogs heaps of times carrying drugs at festivals and raves and never had an issue, didn't stop me shitting myself every time though and definitely not something I'd recommend anyone does without taking the appropriate precautions, MBB was unheard of back in my misspent raving youth and I've seen many a person hauled off for a pat down and strip search, seems much more full on here in Australia than anything I've seen in other countries including the UK.

    Sullum's articles on detection dogs in Reason have been outstanding.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    H/t to Mr. Sullum, if he's reading, by the way. &lt;3
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Rant: As far as I can tell, using detection dogs at festivals is maladaptive security theater that mainly serves to a) make parents/community members feels like Someone Is Doing Something, b) increase the risk of toxic ingestion when panicked attendees take everything when they see the dogs or hear about the dogs. This latter is a really suboptimal strategy, not just because you poison yourself, but also because you'll likely have residue on your hands. Now you get to talk to people about that while the drugs kick in. NOT better. Of course, that assumes that the detection dogs are actually working, which I think varies quite a lot...
    <br/>
    The pros who are arranging bulk quantities for inside distribution, who are the ostensible targets, have this figured out, but the first-second-whatever-time attendees may not.  I would love to see the actuary data on this at some point. :-) Pure anecdata at my end, maybe, but I am way too familiar with events in my region with dogs vs  events without dogs and the number of calls to poison control (from individuals and hospitals) associated with each.
    <br/>
    At least the usual airport pseudosecurity behavior doesn't lead to a spike in poisonings.
    <br/>
    /rant
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've watched the dogs at events that are supposed to be 'drug dogs' and I'm not sure what they're doing, but it's not what I'd recognize as drug detection work, usually. Maybe mass screening works differently. Not my department, Wondermutt here just plays track-it-find-it and identify-it for fun and community service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Zzzz: would I bet my/friends' freedom on a defined aroma-blocking bag that had been sealed at the proper temperature and cleaned by me with clean hands?
    <br/>
    Yes. Because the concepts underlying this are reality-based, and because they are reliable when I test them. Works in theory AND in practice. Win-win.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're curious about the actual abilities of the detection dogs, I'd suggest directing dog-reading towards search-and-rescue/cadaver dogs and their capability/reliability. Less of a political minefield and without the financial incentives of drug detection. Handler reliability/influence are a separate problem.
    <br/>
    I don't think there's the large LEO misinformation campaign re: dogs that is suspected, but maybe there is, and there will always be some jackass who says stupid things - still, most handlers are kind of nerds and tend to correct misunderstandings, rather than amplify them. [Funniest LEO handler moment I've heard about in a while: officer who said at a school demo, "Oh, no, that's not correct, Mr. Smith, Bonzo isn't trained on methylone" when Principal Smith was giving the kids the Fear Of Dog talk and Bonzo started alerting....]

    We had testing tents at our parties in the 90's and when the police turned up it was usually the first thing they shut down, when they stopped the Green Party Drugs Group from testing at Glastonbury we set up some chairs outside their tent and anyone wanting tests was sent to us :)

    Okay, enough of the 'festivals for dummies' advice and reminiscing about the good ol' days  :P  Whats the next step in the war against The Man?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My BIG IDEA is still gift cards with a magnetic strip.  I reckon if you were super clever, you could spread the product out over the surface area of the card, and find a way to laminate it all down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In plain sight is the best place to hide things.  Just ask my missus!  ;)

    Your idea is a good one but it's probably not a good idea we discuss it openly here even though you are right this discussion thread does need to evolve. How we go about that without giving away potential obfuscation methods though presents a challenge.

    Another question about the Heat seal foil..
    <br/>
    Say I have it shoved down my pants and I get a once over with one those hand held metal detectors, would it set it off?

    I am not sure. Heat seal foil is probably very similar to an MBB with a thicker aluminum layer and maybe some hot glue? Might try the wand on tinfoil and other aluminum. Magnets don't work on iron-free metals, but the wands should or they would be easy to bypass.

    Alright thanks guys. Think I will take it in the foil and if I notice there are metal detector wands being used I'll go round the corner, unrap it and then just take it through in a baggie and hope to fuck the dogs don't get me. I've made it past dogs before so should be able to do it again. :P

    Hey Samesame, read this thread when I was starting up and it really helped for packaging techniques. Would it be possible to be added to the list?

     Alright thanks guys. Think I will take it in the foil and if I notice there are metal detector wands being used I'll go round the corner, unrap it and then just take it through in a baggie and hope to fuck the dogs don't get me. I've made it past dogs before so should be able to do it again. :P

    Might take a resealable MBB with something allowed in it (I think snacks like beef jerky sometimes come in a resealable MBB). Then you could switch the allowed item to the baggie - hopefully before the dogs. I really dont think MBBs would be detected by a wand anyway.

    My methods worked guys, loads of pills, cocaine and mephedrone made it past 2 sniffer dogs, one of the spaniel variety and another a white lab (didn't know they used these as sniff dogs?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For pills and coke , MBB, washed, MBB, washed
    <br/>
    Mephedrone, MBB, wash.

    Concealed the pouches inside large FM radio, walked by dogs blasting the music, not even a sniff.

    Just thought I'd update, I got into festival with a load of MDMA/MDA, coke and meth in the heat seal foil.
    <br/>
    There were ~5 sniffer dogs upon entrance who were going up to everyone that walked in and people were getting arrested left right and center, never seen anything like it at a festival before.
    <br/>
    The dog walked right up to me and then just carried onto the next person.
    <br/>
    Feeling pretty shit now to be fair, but defiantly worth it ;D

    wrong. mbb and heat seal foil are two different names for basically the same thing lol. aluminium layer is of the same thickness so there's no reason why the foil would set of the metal detectors while mbb wouldn't

    you're wasting your time with vac sealing/mbb. dogs do not look for 2c-e and 2c-b. vac sealing is only good for flattening things. mbbs provide a good visual barrier though. if you can get custom printed mbbs (i know a vendor who uses those) you can make it look very professional

    You say it's a waste of time then point out a good reasons to use each one..? Besides my customers seem to like the packaging I use so I think that alone is a good enough incentive.

    The combined total of Listings for all 21 Active Vendors: 5+8+25+8+2+1+21+1+3+2+13+14+1+8+9+4+165+23+2+7+2=321

    From my post Re: Domestic Listings per Country/Region on Silk Road: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176825.msg1366571#msg1366571 one can see there's currently 17066 undeclared listings ( I checked the amount of undeclared listings just now and its 17254, so it's not far off from the numbers I got roughly a week ago ). So this basically means in an absolute best case scenario, 1,88093284893941 percent of all listings on Silk Road utilize MBBs of some kind - needless to say there's room for huge improvement here.  :-X :'(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For a final refinement I'm going through each Vendors who ships Worldwide and list the amount of Drug Listings they have for sale:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BashfulBetty: 8
    <br/>
    Budworx UK: 18
    <br/>
    Bungee54: 8
    <br/>
    cyanspore: 1
    <br/>
    DrCol: 3
    <br/>
    Ganja Man: 13
    <br/>
    jerseycow: 14
    <br/>
    Lloydsbrothers: 8
    <br/>
    love: 8
    <br/>
    PlutoPete: 28
    <br/>
    SimplyTheBest: 6
    <br/>
    subtickle: 2
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So all in all from 44 Vendors we're down to 12 Vendors who actually ship Worldwide. The amount of actual Drug Listings ( with MBB capability ) which can be shipped worldwide is: 117
    <br/>
    No wonder the Australians are having a hard time.  ;D

    Yes, I'm not entirely surprised...as a new and fairly active vendor (3 months, 300+ trades etc) I have to say fees, hidden costs (scams and dealing with genuine loss in a respectful way), fluctuating BTC and exchange challenges and keeping standards of supply and stealth consistently high make the business proposition on SR quite demanding - trying to keep prices "reasonable" and deliver value is tougher than many initially think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many customers bemoan the high prices but forget quality costs and conducting business well here is a high overhead....personally I try to offer great value and support but it does take a great effort to maintain this for customers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not moaning here, as it is possible to do good business on SR, but for many I imagine it may not be worth the risks inherent - it would only take a few days out of trade activity to ensure many fail...the recent slump in BTC rate was a good example which hit many decent vendors badly I am sure. Without significant cash-flow it's a very tricky business to conduct safely!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, you're all welcome to come shopping at my store - though in seven days I take a vacation so make sure you get your orders in swiftly!!!

    Hi All
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wanted to ask about Moisture Barrier Bags. I've already had SSBD confirm that MBBs shouldn't be see through. But I wanted to know if anybody else has received a package in an "MBB" that is see through thick grey plastic. The vendor assures me that it is in fact a moisture barrier bag but I'm not sure what to believe. The vendor is K_Queen in the UK and they have mostly good feedback about stealth
    <br/>

    I have to say though DrCols stealth is top notch and it's no denying that is sent in an MBB. I hope I can get another order in before he goes on vacation

     Hi All
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just wanted to ask about Moisture Barrier Bags. I've already had SSBD confirm that MBBs shouldn't be see through. But I wanted to know if anybody else has received a package in an "MBB" that is see through thick grey plastic. The vendor assures me that it is in fact a moisture barrier bag but I'm not sure what to believe. The vendor is K_Queen in the UK and they have mostly good feedback about stealth

    My understanding was MBB should have a foil shield layer but having just googled "see through moisture barrier bags" there appears to be some available so maybe there is such a thing.

    Hey guys
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The see through mylar has to deal with the level of thickness I believe. When I had 3.5 mil they were see through, but my current 4 mil are not see through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "These 5 mil thick mylar bags have a middle layer of aluminum (.00035 which is ideal) and 2 different plastic layers on the inside and outside designed for a wide range of products including long term food storage. Watch out, they are NOT simply metalized polyester that others may offer in the 3.5 mil range that you can actually see through if you hold it up to the light. What is the point in buying a mylar bag if light can still get through it? It's unnecessary since we sell our 5 mil for less than most others sell their 3.5 mil. For all practical purposes they are light proof, oxygen proof, air proof and water proof"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However if they do double mylar I think that would still be sufficient.
    <br/>

     From my post Re: Domestic Listings per Country/Region on Silk Road: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176825.msg1366571#msg1366571 one can see there's currently 17066 undeclared listings ( I checked the amount of undeclared listings just now and its 17254, so it's not far off from the numbers I got roughly a week ago ). So this basically means in an absolute best case scenario, 1,88093284893941 percent of all listings on Silk Road utilize MBBs of some kind - needless to say there's room for huge improvement here.  :-X :'(
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For a final refinement I'm going through each Vendors who ships Worldwide and list the amount of Drug Listings they have for sale:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BashfulBetty: 8
     <br/>
     Budworx UK: 18
     <br/>
     Bungee54: 8
     <br/>
     cyanspore: 1
     <br/>
     DrCol: 3
     <br/>
     Ganja Man: 13
     <br/>
     jerseycow: 14
     <br/>
     Lloydsbrothers: 8
     <br/>
     love: 8
     <br/>
     PlutoPete: 28
     <br/>
     SimplyTheBest: 6
     <br/>
     subtickle: 2
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So all in all from 44 Vendors we're down to 12 Vendors who actually ship Worldwide. The amount of actual Drug Listings ( with MBB capability ) which can be shipped worldwide is: 117
     <br/>
     No wonder the Australians are having a hard time.  ;D

     Hi All

     Just wanted to ask about Moisture Barrier Bags. I've already had SSBD confirm that MBBs shouldn't be see through. But I wanted to know if anybody else has received a package in an "MBB" that is see through thick grey plastic. The vendor assures me that it is in fact a moisture barrier bag but I'm not sure what to believe. The vendor is K_Queen in the UK and they have mostly good feedback about stealth

     I have to say though DrCols stealth is top notch and it's no denying that is sent in an MBB. I hope I can get another order in before he goes on vacation

    MBB's can be transparent, some are polymer laminates that just look like a thick plastic bag, some are polymer laminates with a metallised layer that is applied like electroplating and these look like see through metallic bags, and some are the type with an actual sheet of thin metal as one of the layers.

    Thanks for the clarification. Maybe I can trust this vendors shipping methods. Although the stealth is still not up to the standards of other vendors I have used from the UK

    NW Nugz was in vacation mode for a few days, but, we are usually open for business. I'd guess other vendors run out of stock occasionally and may not have "gone out of business". Some may even be in stealth mode with all the customers they can handle? This time of year I would expect bud vendors to run low on stock before the flood of Fall harvests brings back old vendors and some new.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The semi-transparent "anti-static bags" I have seen are thinner and probably do a pretty good job of containing smell. I sometimes use one as an inner layer. I do not consider them true "MBBs". There are also thinner bags that do block vision that may also not be true "MBBs". I like 3M brand series 2000 and higher. I am sure there are other good ones though. I think what matters is the smell penetration numbers that are discussed in early posts in this thread. Any good bag should have that number available online and we probably should have a number stated in the OP that is a guidline? maximum.

    Ok, so is it just me or do people not consider mylar bags to be "real stealth"? I've had two customers leave me feedback saying "poor stealth" or "almost no stealth". All my products are heat sealed into bags and labeled as a vitamin supplement with CAS information labeled onto the bag. One person responded back to me "my other orders were vacuum sealed". Am I doing something wrong? Do I have to vac seal AND heat seal into mylar? I'm not even selling bud, just legally grey research chemicals. It's just a shame because I feel like people are going to read my feedback and assume that I'm sending shit in a loose ziplock labeled THIS IS NOT DRUGS AND NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION HURURUR

    Some people do leave false feedback to hurt vendor reputations intentionally. Also, many customers mistakenly believe vac-sealing helps keep in the smell. So, it may be worth it to do it for that reason if no other. There can be good reasons to vac seal such as making the package smaller. If your CAS info label tells the truth?, then I would agree you don't have much stealth. Assuming it is false and matches a similar textured product, you probably should not be mentioning such details here ;-). I also have no idea about the quality of the "Mylar bags" you are using. Are they thick and a vision blocking layer? Again, this might not matter if the products don't smell. But if customers think it matters, best make 'em happy while you work on educating the masses about what stealth actually helps. You could even offer a shipping option with extra bells and whistles for customers that want to pay extra to feel safer?

    I'm going to have to spend some time editing the list at some stage as it would seem a fair few of the vendors listed are no longer active.

    I am looking at upgrading to this even though im only domestic just for the extra safety aspect and for my Customers peace of mind. Which of the new types of packaging is determined to be the best and could any Aussies chime in as to where they are best purchased with cash (not off ebay or SR). Are they the same kind of bags that computer/electronic parts come in? Any info Appreciated.

    There are some links in the OP you might want to check out, I am assuming that you can order using a pre pay visa/mastercard to make the sale anonymous and yes they are the same types of bags as used for electronic equipment.

    Thanks so much for sharing all this great information!  I have placed an order for all new shipping materials, and will also elevate my 'stealth' game to the next level.  Although I don't sell coke, weed, or meth, I do sell pills and Suboxone.  Can't wait for the new materials!!  I'm so glad I read this thread.

    Being the OP of this thread I am obviously very happy to see how it has helped shape change shipping practices to safer methods using non permeable packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs are not sitting idly by though and I have it on good authority AU customs have changed their tactics, they may be scanning more letter mail than before or as someone recently suggested to me they could be using other methods to detect MBB, e.g. metal detection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no solid proof of either of these theories but having recently lost an MBB'd order from a vendor whom I trust, I can therefore only conclude that my letter was subjected to something more than a canine sweep, or I just got unlucky, who knows...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I open this up for further discussion, it is good to keep evolving so now I am going to see if there are MBB's that do not have a metalized layer.

    I agree mate, I recently was in touch with a customer in AUS and was informed that customs are scanning or xraying or something for Mbb's.
    <br/>
    We need to come up with some new methods to incorporate these materials into, Otherwise they wont smell it anymore, but will see it via machines. We are getting very comfortable here and need to step our game up.

    every month or so everyone should be reminded to use new methods and ways to beat machines need to be shared and new ones thought up often.

    I'd be interested in the machinery that could scan a pallet of letters - it seems unlikely - do you mean they simply throw a pallet worth of mail into a scanner - in which case it is very painstaking to ID specific rogue packets. I know the queue at the airport takes forever so imagine with 1000's of envelopes...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still quite right to be vigilent and aware of rumour..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As always guys, appreciate the intel and will keep eyes open and brain engaged for new options!

    Keep in mind this is all Chinese whispers, someone hears a rumour then passes it on or adds to it. I wouldn't be surprised if law enforcement deliberately add small lies when talking to people they feel are likely to propagate purely because it doesn't cost them anything and can benefit them to sow discord and make people paranoid about ordering (so less likely to order).

    Im thinking off adding AAA La Blanca Marijuana to my items for sale and these bags would be perfect.  So as far as shipping MJ safely would there be any necessary added security in addition to the moisture resistant bags or would i just place orders in a ziploc (1/2 oz or less ) then vacuum seal in the foil bag and send off safely.  Keep in mind im planning on mostly domestic US to US shipping.

     Keep in mind this is all Chinese whispers, someone hears a rumour then passes it on or adds to it. I wouldn't be surprised if law enforcement deliberately add small lies when talking to people they feel are likely to propagate purely because it doesn't cost them anything and can benefit them to sow discord and make people paranoid about ordering (so less likely to order).

    Very possible it was caught by random inspection. Certain % are always checked randomly. Maybe profiled by address, maybe was in bin next to bad packed weed and was checked along with all else in smelly bin. Many possibilities that more likely then all mail get x-ray. Many items are sent in MBB include electronics and moisture sensitive papers, film, spices, teas, list is endless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Watch for psyops and mis information at all times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    multi laminate bags using specialized resins and OPP,Nylon,LDPE in combinations can approach or equal near Metal layer bags.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try to have send to you 10-15 packages of legal spices that are known to be packed in MBB bags from international and see what % make it and what condition they arrive in.

    For anyone that needs these bags Im going to be putting up listings for some MBB bags that are 10'' x 12'' these fuckers are huge.  These big guys can be cut into
    <br/>
    <br/>
    12  -  3.33" x  3'' bags   (currently about $.37 each on SR)  Total $4.44 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    9 -  3.33'' x 4''  bags (Currently about $.44 each)   Total $3.96 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    8 -  3'' x  5''       bags (Currently about $.47 each)   Total $3.76 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    6-   5''  x  4''    bags (currently about $.60 each)    Total   $3.60 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4-  5''  x   6''  bags (Currently about $.77 each)      Total $3.08 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2-  5''  x   12''  bags (Not available on SR)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1-  10"  x  12"  bag (Not Available on SR)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These are perfect for diverse sellers who sell many different products as you can make bags of all different sizes for all of your products.  Im only charging $2 per bag which will end up saving you a lot on bags.  Plus you will only need to receive one package versus 2 or 3 if you wanted to buy a couple different sizes of bags.  I will consider price cuts on bulk orders  PM me for details.

    If you mean Oven bags (for cooking), I would agree they do keep in smell much better than a ziplock. It would be interesting to compare them to MBBs (the kind of bags that do get you on this threads list). I don't think they can be heat-sealed, but there may be good ways to make them airtight?

    Personally I think there are a number of factors that converge to create challenges, for one nearly all international mail entering Australia comes in via the Sydney mail center. Customs officers also work in teams for several months at a time so they get their eye in for spotting stealth and packaging techniques so they can profile some methods fairly easily.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs services have also had their funding cut so I wouldn't be supervised if they were trying to justify their existence this year so they can say "hey look at all these drugs coming in, if you cut our funding Australia will be flooded with dangerous drugs, think of the children!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sure a lot of drugs also just get caught up in the bio security dragnet but like I said I suspect its more a combination of factors making AU a country you need to up your stealth methods for.

    Just a thought....if customs in AU are in fact detecting the metal in these bags could we not implement encapsulated polymers that are impervious to permeation? I have a few ideas of some methods in which this would be handy, considering you could mold it into any shape and profile you wish.

    Basically, there are 3 kinds of MBB, Tyvek MBB, AMBB and ANMBB, in the the market. The key factor of moisture barrier function of the bag is metal layer, like thickness of the foil layer, foil or metalized, etc., but thickness or material of other layers also can partially affect the quality of MBB.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TMBB has no metal layer, but will be used for less moisture sensitive device and this bag can also be a good choice for foods packing, which requires clean and vacuum properties.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I'm assuming the TMBB has a higher MVTR than normal MBB thus making it not worth using as a canine sweep is the most likely cause of detection. That's assuming they haven't implemented more stringent screening as as matter of course.

    Bags for certain industries (electronics, pharma, bio) are often tagged with visible batch numbers.
    <br/>
    Food service bags for smaller scale use (small craft/production market, home retort canning/preserving, spices) generally are not batch numbered that I've seen.

    for those who don't want to download pdfs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They also specifically discuss aroma barrier for industry-standard aromas. No one's studied cannabis storage/packaging and aroma barrier as part of the food/beverage/etc packaging industry thus far (as far as I know), but I expect that will start to be openly studied/published now in the US.  Or maybe it will just come from the local ag extensions.  That should give some nice data on permeance, though. :)

     Bags for certain industries (electronics, pharma, bio) are often tagged with visible batch numbers.
     <br/>
     Food service bags for smaller scale use (small craft/production market, home retort canning/preserving, spices) generally are not batch numbered that I've seen.

     I keep reposting these, but they have decent information in them and are both viewable via

     for those who don't want to download pdfs.

     They also specifically discuss aroma barrier for industry-standard aromas. No one's studied cannabis storage/packaging and aroma barrier as part of the food/beverage/etc packaging industry thus far (as far as I know), but I expect that will start to be openly studied/published now in the US.  Or maybe it will just come from the local ag extensions.  That should give some nice data on permeance, though. :)
