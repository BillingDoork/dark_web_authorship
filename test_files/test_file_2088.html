    Was looking but could not find a thread with this kinda info...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    looking for peoples personal experience (not I heard from a friend who knows someone)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please describe your dealings you had  in regards to importing into Canada such as.. vendors, packaging, tips and tricks, customs, mail service ect..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to become an informed buyer and I think info like this will help me choose wisely who I deal with for future purchases

    Wow.. I forgot i even posted this.. well I can add some info as I have been here a bit now and have figured some things out..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NL is no issue from what I have seen, actually,.. most people I have spoken with have said that its real easy to get stuff to canada..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still would prefer domestic shipping, as its for sure the easiest way!

    NL to Canada no problem? Hmm, that's interesting to hear. I would presume the opposite. I was wanting to order some molly from NL sellers because the price and quality looks the best, but I am leaning towards going domestic. Would be my first order...

    I had a small order come through in a week from NL, but a second order from NL hasn't arrived yet, it's been about a month, so I think it is lost. No customs letter. Not sure if it made it out of the country, or if my address is flagged or what.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll be sending subsequent orders to another address just to be safe.
    <br/>

    hope this helps.

    NL to Canada 100% success, same with UK and China and Lithuania.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    US to Canada ... a little more troublesome.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canada custom's often holds onto your package, but it's often cuz Canada Post is backed up the ass, it's not something i'd be worried about.  Had several orders with a hole poked in em (usually a hole punch), but as long as you're buying from good vendors that doesn't matter, they poke it near the envelope flap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Their love letter's really ARE love letters.  That is to say, they are very kindly written packet of information on how to be careful about purchasing prescriptions online (the situation may differ if you're buying an ounce of blow, I wouldn't know, don't do coke, heroin or meth, no thanks :) ), and that the letter has been sent to you simply to inform you that your package is being returned.  Not asking you to call/contact anyone.  BUT it may differ if like I said they seize an ounce of C, if it looks like prescriptions they figure its online pharmacies.

    I've had several packages, all hash, arrive very quickly from NL. Even poorly packed in the middle of summer, packaged in two small baggies in a padded mailer. The whole mailbox stunk of hash. Couldn't believe it made it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Got some speed from Germany. Shipping was very fast, about 5-6 days. Arrived in a regular white envelope, inside some folded paper. Second order didn't arrive, but that's because MrFire scammed me. Never FE again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've got weed seeds from the UK no problem many times. I've also got some roids from the UK in the past, not from SR though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't believe I've gotten anything from the States though. What I've found weird however, is that some international packages arrive faster than some domestic packages. I guess some vendors are shipping from near major shipping depots internationally, while some Canadian vendors are a little more rural.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll post more if I remember. Too many dabs in me right now.

    We've successfully shipped to Canada from the UK - it was either just under a week or just over. Can't remember off hand.

    <br/>
    Can't tell you how we pack, but I think the trick with all of these things is to hide in plain sight.

    You'd be amazed at how little many inspectors/police/etc. care about weed in Canada.  I was caught when I was a kid hot-boxing my buddies van while driving it on his b-day (he was smashed, I was sober, drunk drivers = fucktards) and the cop just laughed at me and told me to 'make sure I got home safely' and left.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another occasion a cop fucking took my weed when I pulled over and pocketed it right in front of my eyes.  Didn't mention a single thing about weed to the other officers and they let me go.  Fucker went home and blazed my weed that night, but on the other hand, I also didn't get busted with possession over an ounce haha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Glad I don't live in that ass backwards country called the USA, they'll convict you up to 20 years for possession in texas.  20 years !?!?!?!?!? for WEED POSSESSION.  Fucking rapo's get less then that !
