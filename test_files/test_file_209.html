    Hey Dudes/Dudettes,
    <br/>
    Just thought I would make a post to see what peoples experience is with shipping from Netherlands to UK?
    <br/>
    I'm not really worried about my shipment yet as it was only shipped Monday but I was hoping it would arrive today (Friday).
    <br/>
    It hasn't arrived yet so I am hoping it will be tomorrow, would you say this is likely?
    <br/>
    When it was shipped the delivery time was estimated at 2-3 days, but my vendor did say it could well take longer than this.
    <br/>
    You guys know how it is, just desperate to get my stuff!  ;)

    it;s better than USA and OZ in my experience, but it's worse than germany, belgium etc. its still better than finland though... ie packages do get lost, or i'm getting scammed or whatever

    From my experience the average for NL to UK is 7-10 days, however I've had a few packages arriving within 5 days, I've ordered from NL many times and all but one didn't arrive, my reship arrived within a week. If I was you, I wouldn't worry too much, give it time, and all should be well ;)
