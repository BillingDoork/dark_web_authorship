    I want to buy a small amount of not-too-strong ecstacy (120-150 mg, 2-10 pills) and I have never bought anything on SR before. The problem is that I live in Sweden...in other words customs are tight and I need some excellent packaging. It would also be a good idea that the vendor doesn't live in the Netherlands. What offer should I take from who?

    Afterhour's new packaging is pretty legit. SuperTrips might do the most business on the Road currently, I'm sure they have experience with your country. If you don't mind getting crystal/powder and putting it in capsules yourself - Dutchaanbod is slow, but apparently his packaging is solid. Also there is new CristalClear who has great packaging but is in the Netherlands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly think your best bet would be to contact a few vendors directly and see what their mileage has been to Sweeden. Afterhour will let you stay in escrow if you choose the tracked option - though you may have to sign for the package when it arrives. SuperTrips will make you FE which may not be something you want to do.
    <br/>

    Hope some of this helps.

    SuperTrips won't ship to Sweden. I don't want to put the MDMA in capsules myself (neither CristalClear nor Dutchaanbod make pills). chemicalbrothers are in the Netherlands and the pills are too strong (it's easier if I don't have to sell 2/3 of a pill to a friend). I looked at AfterHour, but I'm concerned about his packaging. Anyone else have experience with his packaging?

    XTCEXPRESS seem interesting. The pills are 170-180 mg. Would that be way too much for someone less than 60 kg?

    I've had it once before a year ago, so I think I could count as a first-time-user again :) You're right, though, it is too much. 120 mg seems like a better dose.

    @ Flyerz Alright, I have some female friends less than 50 kg, which means they should only have 65 mg to be safer-users, good to know. According to the safer-user doses I should only have 75 mg. Would that give me a full effect of the MDMA?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @trc I'm in EU, so I'll probably go for something closer to home, but thanks for offering :)

    I'd add max. 10-20mg for a stronger flight/trip without tolerance, but the effects could be to strong/heavy for a first time user. You definitely get the full effect with 75mg. Do you know about Set &amp; Setting? They should be good - to minimize the chance of a bad trip  8)

    A 100 mg pill should be well enough for me then. I do know about set &amp; setting. I wonder why the hell most pills on SR are around 200 mg? That's one hell of a dose. Are SR users obese or do they all consume on a weekly basis? :o

    Many vendors sell them as a high dosage product - many buyers trust them without thinking.
    <br/>
    Of course the most vendors are trusted and their description is true. If you have such a 200mg pill, you should take 1/4 of it.
    <br/>
    Test a half pill if the dosage is normal (100-150mg), you never know what's in there.
    <br/>
    Some users have a high tolerance I guess. After consuming MDMA it's good to make a break of 1 month (in this time our serotonin "reservoir" replenishes itself)
