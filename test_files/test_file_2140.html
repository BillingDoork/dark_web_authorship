    I've studied something in the internet about the xrays.  I've read that xrays doesn't pass trough xrays, but i have some questions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Have you ever send something with plumb?
    <br/>
    2.Have you heard about plumb for hidding things from xrays?
    <br/>
    3.In the xray screen how do you see the plimb? completely opauqe or just invisible?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please help me with that

    When you say "plumb" do you in fact mean "plumbum" or lead?
    <br/>
    If you pack something in lead it is likely to draw an incredible amount of scrutiny because of its radiopacity.

    you see it completely opaque and it will draw a lot of attention... they will surely open the package.

    It's not that they've 'flogged' us with x-rays.  There are several ways to block x-rays, the problem is that the package will look like a white (or black) block, and that's very abnormal when the box should look like it has 'items' inside it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only way around x-ray's that I know of is if you send product using regular lettermail with 'documents' inside.  In that case it doesn't look abnormal at all if the x-ray scanner shows a big white/black block because they are just document's inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's in a box though, USPS expects there to be something IN the box, when they just see the outline of a brick (or any square/rectangular object and this raises many questions).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again my suggestion is to seal the contraband in x-ray proof materials and put other items in the box so it looks like this mysterious block is just one of many item's being shipped, it would lower suspicion for sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wish I had better advice :(

    That's a good idea, not sure why I didn't think of it :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yeah from his advice, your best bet is to hollow out some legal object and put the contraband inside and reseal it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The absolute BEST method I can think of is to ship a variety of minerals purchased from mineral collector shops (of which there are many, believe it or not there are a lot of people who collect rocks and minerals lol), hollow them out and put contraband in, use the return address of a mineral collectables company and the x-ray scanner will show a very bizarre image because of x-ray diffraction (it might show the outline of the mineral), but postal inspectors (and in fact anyone who knows anything about x-ray crystallography) will know this is simply because the product inside is a crystallized mineral (which diffract x-rays).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    May be a bit of work if you do a lot of orders, but better safe then sorry, and if ever questioned say you're a mineral collector and have no idea why the x-ray machine showed the image it did other then to try and somehow throw in there that minerals are large crystallized structures.
