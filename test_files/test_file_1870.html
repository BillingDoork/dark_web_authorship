    Was hoping people here could tell me the likelyhood of fireworks being caught and flagged shipping from one state to another?
    <br/>
    No international borders,Â  packaged well... is there ways they could be alerted? Or if it looks like any other package will it make it through fine?

    I'll tell you a little story that probably wont help much, but it is somewhat relevant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I was 11-13 years old I used to buy fireworks through ebay (circa 98). I would just send a money order, give them my address, and in a few days - the fireworks would arrive. This was all before 2001 though, so I'm sure they've done something since then.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However I did receive 10+ packages with fireworks in them from CA with no issues whatsoever. My state outlawed fireworks and I was far too young at the time to obtain them myself, so ebay and usps worked just fine. But that was then and this is now.... things are crazier....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck!

    haha thx man :).
    <br/>
    I'm surprised myself that I did that, but at the time I just wanted fireworks and didnt even give one thought about whether it was safe or not. haha - thats when being ignorant and dumb had its upsides.
    <br/>
    I still remember one of the fireworks I got was called a "magic crystal" by Brothers. It was a crystal shaped firework that would spin incredibly fast and was incredibly loud then it would launch into the air even louder then explode. Probably my best fireworks memory.
