    My drop address I think has been screwed up by this "Happytimes" person. Either way don't want to risk it but the more I think about it I feel like opening up a P.O. box with all ur info and cameras in there and what not is a stupid idea...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do other use PO boxes, how has it worked? do you find you package is looked over more or less?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry if this is a stupid question...guess one positive would be faster shipping, idk just a thought...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for any info!

    it works, but not the best idea. I did it for about half a year with no consequences however. In fact, I really like using it in certain situations. Just not the best idea legally.

    Yup if you go through this thread or use the search functions you'll see Shannon and I breaking down the big P.O. box question. It's not in that thread but I'll save you some time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only open a P.O. box if:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A) Your packages get opened by people at your house (parents/roommates/spouses)
    <br/>
    B) Your packages get stolen
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other than that though your best bet is to use your real name and your real address that way you have complete plausible deniability or else if you get caught receiving contraband at your P.O. box they're going to ask you why did you open a P.O. box and why are you receiving contraband at that P.O. box?

    Then I would open a P.O. box and send both things from SR and from regular sites like amazon, that way it can blend in. If you were every to get investigated (which I highly doubt) then you can simply say you opened a P.O. box because your packages would get stolen.

    i have read that if you are receiving to a PO Box, that a warrant issued as part of a controlled delivery would usually only allow a search of your person and your car, rather than having your domicile searched at a street address.   of course, if you really want it to be believeable, it would have to be your mailing address for EVERYTHING.  you should receive nothing at your house other than non-USPS parcels.

    An interesting question would be under which circumstances would a person attempt to set up a box (be it PO or another kind) using a fake ID. I know you'd have to be able to keep a very straight face when presenting it, so this is not for everyone. But could someone elaborate on this?

    You know to have two forms of fake identification and when you do open it you always run the risk of getting caught receiving contraband and then they nail you with the fake identification you used to open the box which will ultimately be your demise in court.

    That's safe in my opinion because it's been proven that NL and certain other countries are red flagged countries and go through more security so if they confiscate it and trace it to your P.O. box they'll probably want to investigate you more.

    i'm sure things like this could easily vary from one state to another, but it makes perfect sense.  a search warrant issued for a controlled delivery is specifically used for them to get that one parcel while it is in the buyer's possession and nothing else.  typically, especially for people with limited criminal records, search warrants are as limited as possible.  there would have to be separate probable cause to get a search warrant for the buyer's residence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but like i said, there are many many little differences with these types of things depending on the state

    I would think that because USPS is federal, that the rules at play are pretty national.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And to using a fake ID - you have to sign when you open one that under penalty of perjury blah blah blah it's all factual, so you'd be in WAY more trouble for fraud than for a misdemeanor amount of contraband.
