    Hey quick question, i got a slip from usps about a package(assuming its from sr), as im not expecting anything else.
    <br/>
    I think i got the slip because my mailbox was already full and it couldn't fit.(I think/thats my theory) On the slip it's circled "delivery confirmation." It says if I want to pick it up,
    <br/>
    it will require my ID. I can also have it redelivered it says.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just want to know what you guys think i should do, I'm not too worried, but im assuming you have more experience in this sort of thing
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    I'm currently in the same spot.  I assume for the same reason as well the package was too big.  I opted for redelivery today but forgot to put the pink slip in the mailbox as the instruct you to do.  I'm checking tracking info and there is no update yet and they didn't leave another slip.  I figured redelivery would be the better route since there is no physical evidence of you getting the package apart from a signature which anyone could forge.
    <br/>
    I'm no expert but I would guess your best plan of action be wait for the next slip.  They send two  three total before they return the package to sender.  When you get the slip make sure you don't get your prints on it and sign your name different than you usually do or have someone else sign it for you.  Leave it there and don't be home when they deliver it.  When you get it write return to sender on it and leave it sitting around for at least 48 hours before opening.  Also make sure you have nothing else in your house you wouldn't want someone to find.

    I figure that's the ultra-paranoid way to go about it.
