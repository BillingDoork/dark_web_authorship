    To my dismay and that of the vendor I am sure too, I just received a much anticipated package via express usps in which it contained 3 separate vials of a liquid in the express envelope that were all broken completely and completely ruined except for 1 of the vials.  Even the 1 vial that was not ruined still was broke and leaking but did not have any of the liquid actually leave the vacuum sealed pouch unlike the other two vials that had the liquid actually leak out of the sealed pouch because of the vial breaking and puncturing through the plastic.  I have done business with this person in the past and consider him to be a top notch vendor here on SR if not one of the best, especially domestically here in the US.  I guess my question is what does the USPS offer in terms of a "insurance" policy on items shipped if any?  Plus its not like I can stroll into the post office, assuming they were the ones who did in fact cause this to happen, and say hey look at what you guys caused to happen please pay for the insurance if there is any.  Not only would that compromise the anonymity of this great place between vendor and buyer, even though the vendor already does have a leg up on the buyer in terms of who you are and where you live but I guess this is the first time I have had a problem with a product i ordered being ruined and not useable when it arrived at my house.  I contacted the vendor immediately to hopefully work out a resolution but I dont know where to place the blame, and I am positive the vendor would have no motive to tamper with the product, and this is a major reason I have ordered domestically on everything but one order bc I dont want my product to be handled rough or be torn apart in customs.  Sorry for the rambling on I am just upset because not only was I looking forward to this for myself but my friends were also looking forward to trying out this whole SR thing without having to setup an account and just order through me.  Fuck, Ass......arghhhh.  Any advice on similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!!

    Where I am, the seller had to provide details of the product and how it was packaged. After that, a refund was sent but the max is $50 so its hardly worth it.
    <br/>

    Work a fair reship out from the vendor. Its neither of your fault so sharing the loss will make up a little for it.

    Fortunately I was able to get the following response from the vendor today "   Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am terribly sorry that that happened. I can resend you what you ordered and do a different type of packaging to ensure that this does not happen again. If you could send me some pictures that would be appreciated as well. I too would like to make sure that this gets resolved in a way that works out for both of us.
    <br/>
    I will work on getting your items shipped out to you again, if that is what you want to do. Please let me know."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will just be happy to receive the products ordered and it has been said here a million times but do your research on whom you do business with here on SR bc I have done business with this vendor before, they were actually the first vendors i purchased from when i started down this wonderful SR based on their feedback and such and although they might not be the cheapest in cost, it truly shows in times like this that they are not just punk kids selling crap.   They are running a legitimate business and know how to treat their valued customers when things do go wrong!!  I will ask him if he minds me saying who he is and i will update when the new shipment arrives.  I am sure most of you have heard of him but he or they are a top notch group of domestic suppliers of great products!!!

    screw the 5/5 Hatter is in a league that very few on SR are on, I can think of maybe less than a handful and that's not just from my limited experience but from friends that have been on here for a very very long time!!
    <br/>
    Talk about an A PLUS vendor here on SR. The usps screwed up my package, wont go into much detail but the product was rendered useless and the same day that i notified Hatter of the problem he IMMEDIATELY shipped out to me the products I ordered from him and sincerely apologized for the inconvenience. Even though it was clearly on the usps for screwing it up to begin with which is out of his control and he does do the most advanced packaging to make sure that accidents do not happen unless "extreme" carelessness happens by the USPS which I have not experienced until now through him or any of my other purchases here on the road. The feedback says it all and if you wonder why he requests a 5/5 or wont do business with you is because he runs this like a BUSINESS which it should be. Plus if their is an honest mistake he will work with you to make it right instead of other vendors from which I have read horror stories about. That is why we may pay a bit more of a premium for the products we buy here compared to the "street" but factor in Quality of product, Anonymity, Harm Reduction...which hatter goes above and beyond in my book, safety, communication with respect for the buyer, and all the other bs associated with dealing with a ""local" dealer whom in my case never seems to have consistent product and who could care less about anything mentioned above.....it without a doubt warrants the few extra bucks to order from Hatter here on SR and keep this great site and community alive for all of us to enjoy. Now instead of having to take a drive myself into a place i dont want to go I can have a relaxing weekend and share the products with my friends for their first experience with product from SR. Very excited to "get right" so I am counting down the hours till 5 oclock....ahhhh fuck it it's 5 somewhere right?? Cheers to all and have a great weekend...especially to Hatter and those who help him do what he does to make him a TOP Vendor here on SR!!!!!

    You know I've had some people tell me USPS first class pills came crushed. never had a problem with any other method. But honestly i would work with anyone who told me that claim. if the product wasn't usable i would replace. but most the times mine are pills. i offer them a couple options. such as sending it back for a complete replacement or partial refund as a way of saying sorry, but i figure half the people buying my pills are going to crush them up anyway.
