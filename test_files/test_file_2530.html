    Yo SR,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How does receiving envelope mail from spain to the UK work? Is it given any extra go overs because of the country of origin? It cannot be that common a sight seeing letters from spain to residential address. I alone would consider that suspect. Should I be worried or does there have to be good reason to intercept a letter from abroad?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks yo!

    International mail does get checked more thoroughly than domestic. But the amount of mail that does get checked is still only a drop in the ocean.

    Letters coming from Spain aren't at all suspect in my eyes.
    <br/>
    If it was me, I wouldn't be worried at all. The chances of an envelope being intercepted are slim to none.
