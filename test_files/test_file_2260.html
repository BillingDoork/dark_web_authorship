    I've read about remailing chains - that forward a package to three or four different addresses before it arrives at your house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, I can't think of anyway this could be done completely anonymously - since the final link would have to have your address on file.
    <br/>
    However, there might be ways around this that I haven't thought of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you know of a way that this can be done securely?

    Sounds REALLY complicated, and risky.  If you are that paranoid SR may not be good for you. I can understand being anxious when buying in bulk, but for a personal order it seems excessive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is anonymous what is stopping someone from keeping your package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where did you read about this?

    It can be something like this...
    <br/>
    If we say you live in Dutchland and you want to buy 3kilo coca shipped to Dutchland from Turkey
    <br/>
    And you have trusted freinds in Greec, Italy, France and they are able to help you with this stuff.
    <br/>
    First you send package from Turkey to Greec, then your freind from Greec he send the item to another freind of you in italy and so on until you recive it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Risks can be low or high, tbh i have never tryed it.

    While that approach would protect you if the item was being watched from the original sender (in your example, Turkey), though only if your buddy in "Greece" would be willing to take the rap for you on 3 kilo's (I need more friends like that, maybe should start a religion),  you actually quadruple your exposure/risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about it, if the package was sent from Turkey to Deutschland the exposure would be the people processing it at the drop off point, at the hub it is sent to, at the hub it's received at, and finally the person actually delivering it.  Now if you sent it to all those places the package would go through that same process 4 times instead of once, not to mention the legitimate risk of each of your four buddies picking it up and transporting it (not to mention them deciding to keep it and tell you it was lost).
