    Hey, I ordered an ounce of weed that was shipped last Wednesday morning and the DCN shows it as delivered today, but it definitely didn't come. Anyone have any advice on what I should do? Go to the post office with the DCN perhaps? Am I fucked?

    Seeing as DCN no longer exists do you mean the tracking showed "delivered?"  Regardless...if it shows as being delivered then chances are it was in fact, delivered.  That's not to say it was delivered where it was supposed to be delivered.  Sometimes things get mistakenly delivered to the wrong address.  Another real possibility is that the shipping address was written or transcribed incorrectly and the pkg was delivered to the address written in error.  This happens quite often and rarely will the sender have any clear record of it.  The only real way I know for the sender to be able to show after the fact,  how they addressed a pkg is for them to either scan or photograph the pkg before sending out.  The PO won't be able to do anything for you once the carrier has scanned the tracking barcode as "delivered".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was addressed correctly but mistakenly delivered  to the wrong address there's a chance whomever received it would hand it back to the mail carrier who would then deliver it to you.  If that person happened to know you(like maybe it was delivered to a neighbor)you'd probably be in luck.  If it was put back into the system as a RTS(return to sender) it will get sent back to the return address on the pkg.  Of course, there's the chance whomever got your mail in their box(if that's what happened to your pkg) opened it and kept it or tossed it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your best chance to track it down on your own definitely would be to speak directly with the mail carrier who handled it and do it right away.  Chances are good they will remember the pkg and where they delivered it if it was that same day or yesterday.  However, ask them about it 2 or 3 days later and obviously your odds diminish.

    Th3creeper has great advice if you HAVE to get the package.  Keep in mind however, that if you do as he suggests and it's contents are discovered, there's no plausible deniability. In other words, you ordered an oz of weed and attempted to retrieve it.  You're going straight to jail, do not pass go, do not finalize and save your buyer's stats(and you still don't get the weed!). :P

    I have this same problem. A package is marked as delivered yesterday and i still haven't received it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone had it marked delivered but got it a couple days later?

    I had this issue with a national courier service with a legal package.  I rang up and asked about it, the lady took a while to work out what happened, it had gone to the wrong XYZ street ~20km away due to a new driver.  The courier was dispatched to pickup and redeliver it.

    I've posted a thread about this before this one was created. I've made an order of methylone from a trusted vendor who informed me the status said it was delivered, so I figure "Guess I'll wait another day, probably still at post office and will come tomorrow like always." It's been 6 days, nothing, and surely my 60 year old neighbors haven't said anything about it if it were to be dropped off at the wrong address. Upon seeing this thread after wondering if I was the only one, it's starting to worry me. Possibly a new trick of LE to mark them delivered for some reason? The only problem with that is that my vendor's packaging is stellar and wouldn't have a problem with suspicion, very curious and paranoid about this.

    A couple of years ago when i was in the US. I used to buy a lot of shit from ebay, amazon etc. One day i had the same problem with a legal package that was shipped from amazon through UPS, tracking status said it was delivered and it even said the time it was and they usually knock the door, but at that time i was in the house and no1 knocked. I was like damn someone must have stolen it or the mailman  did.
    <br/>
    However after talking to amazon support they called UPS directly and they told them the box was damaged so it was being sent to the return address, it felt weird because the tracking status were normal "out for delivery" and "delivered". I believe someone fucked up the box while it was in transit so instead of delivering it to me they sent it back.
    <br/>
    But yeah the tracking said it was delivered, i dont know if the same applies to any of you but i was just sharing my story.

    Delivered could mean as soon as its left for delivery to you,  they just mark it as delivered, even though its not.

    Its simply on its way to you i'd say.

    As everyone else stated "It is probably on the way"

    Last time the tracking said my SR package had arrived it actually showed up the next day so I wouldn't worry too much

    Mnths back i had a international package show on the USPS as'Deliverd' but it in fact was not and did not arrive til the next day.. I called the P O And asked and at first they said no we dont have anything but a few letters for your address, i said well this is a international package and the tracking says it was 'deliverd' yesterday.  She told me to hang on, came back and said 'we found it, it was in one of the bins that just came in..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the USPS fucks up.. Give it a day or 2..if nothing happens. And if its worth it to you, wait til u see your mail man and speak with him..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But u have no way out of saying u wernt expecting or dont know what it is.. Good luck bro
