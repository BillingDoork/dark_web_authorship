    Hey guys. I have the coins in my account and PGP open. But I just can't bring myself to actually put the order through. I've had about 10 orders off the Road, even some from overseas but it's all been blotters of Acid. I never worry too much about ordering acid because it's very small quantities and it's probably imo one of the stealthiest drugs you can buy. I'm a bit worried about the LSD though. I'm either going to go with Jor or Symbiosis. I think I'd prefer to go with Jor as I've ordered off of him/ her/ them/ it before and they do have good stealth. That said Jor has put that they are overloaded with MD and XTC orders lately. I also would prefer to get the MD sooner rather than later as I have a party coming up. Symbiosis is of course the second option but I've never ordered from him before. He has good reviews.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thing that worries me about MD i suppose is how I think it's much more likely to get intercepted. I'm only going to order a g but even so I'm still worrying about it. Any tips, any stories/ advice. Am I being a pussy or am I being legitimately cautious. Thanks for any advice. If I do order it'll be domestic UK. Does Royal Mail scan or x ray or sniffer dog random packages?.

    Domestic UK you really have next to nothing to worry about, especially if you've got stealth like JoR's.Â  Always good to be cautious but no need to worry here IMO.

    Stick to UK vendors and you will pretty much have no chance of getting the package intercepted! No customs on domestic post and the amount of post that gets sent means that its not even feasible to even think about checking it all! main things that get intercepted is cannabis due to the smell!! you will be fine for a g of molly! I have had much larger orders arrive safely in one day!!

    For extra stealth, ask the vendor to crush it into a powder. Some vendors offer this on their profile, and others do it unless you ask them not to. If the vendor is unwilling, move on. Plenty of great UK mdma vendors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, it's not a necessary step to take if you're ordering domestically. But it can't hurt, and if it gives you peace of mind then it's worth dropping the vendor a message before ordering.

    Don't worry about pills. I've been ordering 100pills/package from other continent, and they all arrived safely. With a good stealth it can be hidden very nice.

    Ordering domestic in the UK is perfectly safe. Choose a reputable vendor and you will have absolutely nothing to worry about.
