    Heart still pounding from what just happened. 2 days ago I ordered from the most reliable vendor on SR. I specified PRIORITY MAIL as I always do. Here's why I do that:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in a nice, white picket fence, suburban residential community with my wife and kids. I live in a single-family home. Our mailboxes are the cluster boxes that lock, so the mailman only has to make one stop for the 20+ houses on our street. This is perfect for me because I can have Priority Mail shipped to me and it will be deposited in my locked box, for me to retrieve at my leisure. I "lost" my wife's key, so only I have access.  ^_^
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I make sure to tell vendors when I order to use Priority Mail and NO SIGNATURE REQUIRED!!!! If the mailman comes to my house while I'm at work, my "stay-at-home and homeschool the kids" wife may intercept my delivery, and that would lead to ...tension in the home :-/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, back to the order I placed 2 days ago - it arrived TODAY - via USPS Express - and the fucking mailman didn't just knock on my door, he POUNDED on it! My wife went to answer it and I jumped in front of her and intercepted the package. Told her it was a Christmas present for her (damn - now I actually have to BUY her something to fulfill my lie! ;-)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The whole time I'm thinking "WTF? I requested Priority No Sig! Is this a Controlled Delivery???"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mailman said "They waived the signature requirement, so here ya go" and left.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My vendor is SUPER cool and was just trying to hook me up by getting the gear here super-fast. I really do appreciate that, but holy shit - I was nearly compromised! Moral of the story - adhere to delivery instructions at all costs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are people living double-lives using SR to feed their monkey and their cover may be blown if you don't!  ^_^

    Boyyy. Wow. Well that's not too good. I'd be sketched out too! Personally, I feel that's not right on the vendors part if you said priority mail and they usually ship priority mail, it should be priority!
    <br/>
    Never had that happen to me. To have a receiver sign something without them knowing they had to sign in the first place raises paranoia I'm sure. Hope no other vendors do that in the future and if something requires a signature they should definitely have that in bold on their product!
    <br/>
    Glad to hear everything went ok though. Well guess you'll be making your wife happy now! lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take care.

    I expect that something like this could always happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor slip up, or post office / postal worker slip up, just got to expect this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's a lot of info you're posting about yourself there, you might want to rethink how much info you put into your posts.

    I use USPS Express a lot and this is normal where I live....some of the carriers will leave it in your mailbox and some will deliver it to your door/ring the bell even if the signature has been waived so keep that in mind any time your use Express.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I actually love it when I get a carrier who will bring it to the front door and ring the bell so then I know that my package is just chilling at my front door.

    Lol how so? LE are now going to swoop every residential area in the states with cluster boxes asking wives "did your hubby buy you a christmas present?"
    <br/>
    You're paranoid. If you're ordering personal amounts like I imagine this fellow is then you have nothing to worry about anyway... LE isn't going to bust down your door for 2 grams of this powder or 7 grams of this bud. He's revealing just as much as you, I'd bet money you're white and American, based entirely on your statement lol

    Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you.  If your express mail package could have been delivered to your mailbox, but the mailman POUNDED on your door, maybe he's trying to tell you something.  Some mailmen are pretty cool.  Maybe he's getting suspicious and wants you to figure out that you're throwing up red flags that those who look for such things will notice.  If you have the wife homeschooling the kids there, you certainly don't want a SWAT raid on your house!  Change up your MO and up your security just in case.  You will not look back and say "man I wish I hadn't been extra careful", but the reverse may not be true!  You need to find an offsite location to receive your packages.  One that doesn't have your name attached to it.  For buyers, LE will go after the low-hanging fruit, and your branch might be getting kinda heavy.  Trust your instincts.  Don't dismiss those feelings that something may be wrong.  You're not a priority as an end user so if you stop giving them evidence, they will probably let it go, but if you make it easy for them, they have stats they are trying to meet, and they will bust you.

    It's not about the info you give out leading to you getting busted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What it IS about, is SHOULD you get busted, however that may be, the more info you post about yourself online is only going to help LE build a case against you should they need to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It never ceases to amaze me how this isn't instantly apparent to those posting here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Feel free to ignore the advice.

    Otherwise, you're welcome.
