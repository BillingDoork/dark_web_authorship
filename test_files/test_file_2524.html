    I ordered a tab via and was shipped Monday via 1st class mail so it's not a package so I thought it should've been here Wednesday at earliest, Friday at latest and it still hasn't arrived.  I know there have been lots of cutbacks and I've searched through the threads and I've only seen one or two complaints regarding package delivery and not a normal letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know be patient but I think it's really odd that it's taking this long when I've ordered packages and they've arrived quicker than that. I'm a bit worried since it's just a letter but I guess it's just a be patient type thing. Anyone else having mail issues? 1st class specifically.

    You can worry tomorrow and freak out in a few days, but right now it isn't surprising at all that you haven't seen it yet.

    There's a chance the vendor your ordered from didn't actually ship it when they put it "In Transit." I receive First Class letters and packages every week from the otherside of the country because of my business and 95% of the time they get here on the 3rd business day...so if I had an item shipped on Monday I will receive it on Wednesday via First Class. Every now and then First Class is a day late and in the past year I have had 1 letter that was "missent" and took an extra 2 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Summary: First Class is actually pretty fast and is a lot like Priority so my guess would be that the vendor you ordered from postmarked it late.

    Day five no arrival. He said that he had sent it first thing monday morning. I could have been tricked but don't really see why. I think it actually is pretty surprising that have 5 days no arrival since 2-5 is the norm and five is really pushing it normally. Idk if it got lost or junked at this point.
