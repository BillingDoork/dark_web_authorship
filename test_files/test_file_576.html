    Hello,
    <br/>
    To our Australian customers.  We have been choosing to ship on a case
    <br/>
    by case basis to Australia for some time now.  We were very close to an
    <br/>
    arrangement whereby we would have been able to ship a large order to an
    <br/>
    individual in Australia who then could have re-distributed our product
    <br/>
    domestically, but unfortunately that fell through for several reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With most of NSW on fire right now, our packages appear to be taking
    <br/>
    even longer than normal to get to their final destination, and while we
    <br/>
    still do not officially ship to Oceania at this time, we will continue
    <br/>
    to access orders on a case by case basis.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We've had great success to Queensland, Victoria, Sydney, etc. so far,
    <br/>
    with only a single small order not making it (no customs letter ensued).
    <br/>
    We think the prices you pay for our product domestically are insane if
    <br/>
    not downright criminal (ha!?).  We would love to be the international
    <br/>
    vendor of choice for all of you, but it is very difficult for us to
    <br/>
    send out the product to meet the demand with all the inherent risks
    <br/>
    involved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So going forward.  Please message us on SR prior to placing an order
    <br/>
    with us.  We would prefer to send larger order (8ths or more) via
    <br/>
    courier rather than singles.  The Courier is an expensive option ($90
    <br/>
    CA) but compared to what you are paying for singles right now
    <br/>
    domestically or even on the road, it is still a good bargain.  This at
    <br/>
    least guarantees you get your product in a timely fashion, and that we
    <br/>
    can confirm that is the case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Recent Feedback we've enjoyed getting:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    xxxxxxxx: I have to admit SmoothriderX's gear is up to par with the best of the bunch (Llyod, Budworx, etc).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    xxxxxxxx: Quality 5/5 - Up there with MINs old gear. double acetone wash yields approximately 70% (really!!)
    <br/>
    Customer Service 5/5 - These guys are pros. They know exactly what they're doing. Fast, friendly and clearly well organised.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    xxxxxxxx: Great quality for the price. Good stealth, Probably some of
    <br/>
    the best Ive seen so far. Order from SmoothriderX with confidence.

    This thread gives me a lot of hope for the aus scene.  You are absolutely right re: Australian prices being absurd, its a shame that your project fell through, however if you are still willing to deal with aussies shipping from your normal location, thats good enough for me!

    as far as I'm aware, private courier companies DO NOT need a search warrant from a court in order to look through your mail/packages. Where as with Auspost (not talking customs here) if they think a package is suspicious and want to open it up they need to go through the hassle of getting a warrant from the court.

    I thought the general consensus was that couriers were less safe.

    I have at least one vendor consistently getting sizeable amounts through. All you need is good packaging and customers are no problem at all.

    except your auspost package is most likely to be opened at an international mail centre, where there are plenty of customs officers.
    <br/>
    so they might need a warrant, but they would just hand the package to customs and customs will deal with it.

    Auspost wouldn't bother getting a warrant they would notify the local  police who only need 'reasonable cause' so a suspicion it contains contraband to open it as far as I was aware.

    Unlike similar situations in the U.S, Aust Post doesn't need a court issued warrant to open a suspicious package. They would simply involve the authorities to make that decision, either the Police, Hazmat if they suspected it contained a hazardous material or the Bomb Disposal Unit if a bomb was suspected. Through Customs, if a package requires opening for inspection, Customs must have Aust. Post open the package to allow them to carry out an inspection. The law doesn't permit Custom's to actually open the package to do an inspection (not sure why that is?).
    <br/>
    mdmafx is basically correct with what they posted. "Reasonable cause" is all that's needed and as I said, a warrant is not required to open a package.

    I think we downplay our market, Australia is one of the biggest markets on SR given domestic prices so it is hardly surprising to see vendors marketing themselves to aussie buyers. This does unfortunately only draw unnecessary attention to the AU community and ultimately the vendor who risks being targeted and profiled as seen recently with MiMM. Concentrating lots of info in AU specific related threads is a bad idea too.

    As to OP q., hmm, yes I would have thought a distributor a good idea as Australia Post and Australian Customs have gone mad lately with mail. This would dis-intermediate that problem. ACE doesn't even ship to AU; only country in the world he won't tap that ass. We Aussies are generally quite eager to trade internationally, both guns and drugs, besides, it makes us feel like a big man doing business with someone O/S  ::) A re-shipper food for thought. So long as the prices don't start reflecting our phuced ^ way of doing things. A guy can really clean ^ in AU if not greedy, a lot of people are tired with the street way of dealing.

    G'day Raz. Was just playing around with things. Have a few new ones I'll be testing shortly until I feel which one I like the most. It's a bit like George Costanza from Seinfeld, where he dresses in the morning according to how he feels. I think it's an early episode called The Trip, where he tells Jerry he dresses according to his mood. When Jerry asks what mood he had dressed for on the morning they were leaving , he said "Morning Mist". Sorry there Raz, I digress. Thanks for the offer of some pics Raz, but I literally have a plethora to pick from already.  :) More than I'll ever need and then some.  ;)

    Common sense dictates that AUS/NZ are already topics of hot discussion for import problems, that go beyond SR products, not limited and including invasive species of animals, vegetation, creatures of the sea.  Your market is drastically under-served, and until we starting restricting our shipping you all made up better than 60% of our inquiries and orders, this  was a complete shock to us, and we have tried to be as honest with you all as possible because we would never want to alienate folks who are turning out to be our better clients.

    You are kidding yourself if you don't think LE from every national branch is on here buying from vendors and gathering intel. As long as you use best practices, and keep to high standards, this community can continue to be served internationally.

    Insurance probably wont work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a buyer wanted to scam, they still could effectively. Paying 120%, and getting 200% back - IE product + money back.  Which leaves the vendor out of pocket 80%.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    If there was going to be any form of insurance, it should be done with registered tracking post.

    How does knowing the number of seizures help estimate a per ratio seizure rate unless you have the same accurate data re orders placed? No offense intended but having these types of discussions based on pure speculation just adds to the FUD factor on here.

    Your safety is our primary concern. We are looking to update our packaging so that it blends in more with the usual flotsam of international mail. Rest assured, we will not be gone too long. We've only had one pack go "maybe missing(?)", and although we do not consider this to be due to our packing, we just think its a good idea to keep them guessing =)

    Actually Customs have more power than the police, they do not need Auspost there merely a second Customs agent to monitor the first. Customs can open anything, anytime, anywhere. Except your house......thankfully they still need a warrant for that.

    That's incorrect. I have a friend who works for Aust. Post (not a postie) who informed me of this. It is also how Custom's operate when watching Border Security, which back's up the scenario told to me by my mate. Custom's aren't permitted to open the package should further examination be required.

    So our final decision re: Oceaia, is as follows.  No orders under 3.5g.  Any negative buy stats (auto-finalize, or refund) disqualifies you
    <br/>
    from the sale and it will be cancelled with an explanation (always an explanation).
    <br/>
    Maybe of you seem to be re-selling our product at considerable mark-up, but all the same, what the market seems to bear. so in that
    <br/>
    case. orders of 14g -28g will require a actual addreess with an actual human being to reveive the pack. No ID need be provided,
    <br/>
    but if they request a signature.  fake it.  The Courier envelope will still contain a #10 envelope of familiar design, be sealed and
    <br/>
    contraband in the usual way (that is to stay stealthily).
    <br/>
    Please enjoy our products safely and do not rob your clients based on our more  inexpensive rates.

       I bet that Aust. Post are required to just open the package. They don't go into it, just gain entry. Next time it's on tango, you watch who actually is required to open a package for further examination.  :)

      Wadozo, is absolutely correct. We have inside information that reveals that Aus Post mail sorters will open the package for the Customs officer to inspect, once open and contraband is found it is taken by Customs Officer for logging/seizure/who knows.

    Customs officers do not need Auspost to be present when doing anything...they're customs. They have authority.
    <br/>
    IF Auspost suspects something they call customs to do the deed. Auspost is not authorised to open mail, not even domestic post. They need customs present.
    <br/>
    Auspost delivers letters, that is all. If something is suspicious they will call customs agents.
    <br/>
    They(customs) decide if it gets referred to police or not.

    Here's customs talking themselves up...

    There is nothing in there that we don't agree with, Customs do detect the drugs and if found to be real after testing, the AFP take over and investigate. However, if a package is suspected of containing illegal drugs by Customs through x-ray, sniffer dog detection or just because of suspicion (country of origin, false documents, etc), THE PACKAGE IS INITIALLY OPENED BY AUSTRALIA POST, WHO DON"T DO ANYTHING BUT "BREAK THE SEAL" SO TO SPEAK. It is then returned to the Custom's officers who will carry out an inspection of the contents. If any illegal drugs are suspected of being found, Customs will firstly carry out an initial Drug Test to confirm their suspicions before passing the drugs (should it test positive) on to the AFP to carry out an investigation. Your brochure is correct but Australia Post are the ones who use a Stanley knife to break open a package before returning it to Customs to search for the contraband.

    Does it really matter who opens the package? If drugs are detected your package will get opened and inspected. Hopefully the vendor will use enough stealth so nothing is found. In my time here I have had it happen once,  AQIS opened a package, inspected it, then sealed it back up with orange tape and sent it to me with 5g of MDMA in it, sadly though that vendor no longer exists and I haven't seen any overseas vendors using that sort of stealth.

     So our final decision re: Oceaia, is as follows.  No orders under 3.5g.  Any negative buy stats (auto-finalize, or refund) disqualifies you
     <br/>
     from the sale and it will be cancelled with an explanation (always an explanation).
     <br/>
     Maybe of you seem to be re-selling our product at considerable mark-up, but all the same, what the market seems to bear. so in that
     <br/>
     case. orders of 14g -28g will require a actual addreess with an actual human being to reveive the pack. No ID need be provided,
     <br/>
     but if they request a signature.  fake it.  The Courier envelope will still contain a #10 envelope of familiar design, be sealed and
     <br/>
     contraband in the usual way (that is to stay stealthily).
     <br/>
     Please enjoy our products safely and do not rob your clients based on our more  inexpensive rates.

    It's just a risk assessment, we have to draw the line in the sand somewhere. Originally we had no intention of being anything but a domestic supplier, but as crazy as it sounds, we had more inquiries right away from Aussies than anybody else.  Your market is drastically under-served  and your local product is drastically over-priced, and as a result it seems to have bred an environment of client mistrust, and vendor ratings blackmail and/or slander.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We would love nothing better than to sell our product unhindered to the population, and we want to be clear, we do NOT think your customs is any more or less stringent in mail inspection than any other industrialized, first world, Nation.  Our successful deliveries there have shown as much.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The trouble stems from the number or ridiculous requests for unreasonable amounts of product from Australians.  Many who are inquiring about half a pound or more, and many more who try to get us to work OOE in order to save them a few dollars (by us shaving DPR's commission).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We get three to four emails a week from people with simply awful stats, trying to buy large quantities from us, and by the second or third correspondence describing the 50% resolution they expect if their packs go missing.  We decline as politely as we can -- only to have an hour later, the EXACT same request from a less-than-a-month-old 0/0 account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While we agree to 50% resolutions on principle, and thankfully never in practice, we do not make that much in the way of profit.  A 50% resolution for us from a fraudster means we are out cash in hand, while they've secured several ounces for far, far, below any market value (less than $30 an oz).

    We are trying to establish some..ANY kind of relationship with a steady supplier who will reflect our product domestically to you at only a reasonable mark-ups., but twice now, it's looked like we found our guy, only to have him/her disappear right before the deal's sealed.

    But really, it's really good to know that some vendors on here are doing things like this for the "people", in this case, us Australians, than to be maximizing their profits (everyone needs to make some profit at least, duh!). Although, I haven't been on the road for long (a month/or two), I'm quite irritated and saddened that a fair few (Which I hope is not the majority) people have come into this SR thinking about themselves, and not the whole of the Australian community and just taking what they want and leaving, tarnishing the Australian community and prospective newcomers from coming onto the road.

    We may elect to delete this later, but these is the cold hard facts. We make the most profit selling single grams, the amount of trouble, work, and worry, we go through  selling singles to Australia makes it difficult to justify.  There just isn't enough volume on SR for us, compared to our local and national networks to make the profit necessary to justify the risk.  Consider that we lose money out of pocket for every 50% resolution, and the lack of means we have to challenge those claims from where we are, when all we can do is spend $5 in stamps to get you our product.  Unless you are extremely desperate, or carefree with your cash, spending $90 for 3 days guaranteed shipping is not a viable option on singles, or even perhaps 1/8ths.
    <br/>
    There are rules/taboo against showing profit margins, but it needs to be said. If we relied on SR orders alone, most in our group would starve.  We try to stay in the bottom 10% of cost, and in the top 20% of quality. Despite this, in two months, after start-up costs, we are about one high-end home-type espresso maker ahead.  ;)

    There isn't much competition from Australian vendors, I totally agree. What I mean is that potential vendors are viewing these prices and evaluating the potential for big profits, even with a price increase.

    I might be SSBD! :P That still doesn't change the fact that there is undoubtedly 2 avatars on nearly every profile I've seen tonight on various threads. Similar to what some other members experienced when the the site's software was upgraded.

    You were going to send me some things you had an interest in, some ideas so I could send you some and you could choose one yourself. I just need a starting point and I'll send you a variety to pick from. When ever your ready, just send me some ideas.  :)
