    As the title says, when you look up a Tracking Number, what is usually displayed after a item is intercepted? I mean do law enforcement continue to update the tracking along to pretend its still en route when there planning todo a controlled delivery? Or will the tracking info just stop being updated. Even if there not planning on doing a controlled delivery what happens?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm more referring to Domestic Canadian Packages but info from other countries is still useful.
    <br/>

    Anyone know?

    Lol nah I am actually pretty interested myself. I have heard they actually go to the extent to deliver mail to your other neighbors to make it look real. I would not put updating shipping info past them!

    i could see it now: Out For Controlled Delivery
    <br/>
    just make sure your house is clean and you wont have anything to worry about. if you think its been compromised then dont open the package. you should probably leave your house before the mail usually comes and drive around to see if you can spot any suspicious vehicles or a police van. and then when the mail does come if he doesnt leave it there follow that fucker around and see how many houses he actually goes too. you were just trying to see if you mounted the tires correctly after rotating them.(i wouldnt go that far but i do usually post up at the store so i can see who all is going down my street on delivery days)

    Yeah no I don't think I'm compromised, I was just tracking a package and wondered to myself what it would actually say if they intercepted it and were planning todo a controlled delivery, like was wondering if the tracking would just stop getting updated or if they'd go as far as falsely updating it so it looked like it was proceeding normally.

    Honestly there is no way to tell how the tracking would be updated. They might check to see who is tracking the package. Just clean house and hope for the best,dont track your package,you should let the vendor do that if it has to be done. they can possibly trace whoever was tracking it so that means whoever was tracking it was expecting it. dont track anything,if they can prove you tracked it then you have no plausible deniability.
