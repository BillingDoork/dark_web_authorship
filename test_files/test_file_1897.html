    Need some some general info and so you all need to vote.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems like shipping to Australia seems to be taking some time lately and I keep getting messages about other vendors shipping times and a couple about mine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So yeah, can any Australians who see this at least vote. Don't matter if you don't want to give deets, it's understandable as it's a safety issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It'd be nice to work out whether they are ramping up searching post or what.

     the good vendors seemingly have no issues whilst the ones you know always do, continue to do so with 21+/month delivery times.

     seriously demand more from vendors and strike a line through the cunts and never look back.

     &lt;- 14 days is where the line needs to be drawn in the sand, from the time vendor places you in transit.

     no issues other than one vendor who has the bomb diggity and he knows it, gets me within 8 days if he really wanted too.. now takes 1 month saying ya need a new drop. u for real dickhead? i know your going back to ur old ways.

     so 3 vendors in 3 pretty represented regions continue.. well others struggle?

    My thoughts were along the lines of that some peoples addresses had been marked and they are shopping with the same vendor. I don't know really know, it's just speculation. None of mine are at the point where I think there is an issue but time is wandering on and those with problems with others have got in touch with me about it so I'm concerned.

    My two cents; I get lots non-SR things shipped in from OS and I've never had a problem, whether they're packages or envelopes. The only ones I've ever had a problem with are SR deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which means one of three things. Either SR vendors are the unluckiest shippers in the world, our customs are good or we're being scammed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, I reckon it's a little of all three. As for deliveries, I've heard of 7 days fairly recently from Germany.

    I really wanted to lie on that poll just to not help paint a target on my fellow Aussie's backs for scamming or possibly give LE anything to gloat about,

    I am still waiting on a small package from Germany marked in transit 10/7 after &gt;7days processing. Realistically prob sent out a week after that anyways.
    <br/>
    Whether or not my order is included, the majority of issues in the early July shit fight are likely caused by an unknown turn of events in Germany herself, probably due to pressure from international Cuntstoms agencies.
    <br/>
    Not sure why UK would see any of these type of delays/issues other than the Olympics wreaking havoc
    <br/>
    I have an incoming Ivory order expecting today or tomorrow............will update on that as its probably more directly useful to Limetless' drama

    Yeah, still awaiting on a tasty Molly/Mandy/Dizzle order from Pfandleiher 2 months ago. Didn't arrive after a month, Pfand claimed a reship but it was never sent apparently. Pffffff. Finalised early so I've got no chance of a reship/refund either.

    And for the record, while Aussie girls are just more visually appealing (read: they exercise their thighs in front of a mirror more than their nostrils). London girls are just fucking hot to trot, from the insecure little artists of SE15, to the 'look at me' hipsters of East London. Aussie girls may look the treat, but damn those London girls are just hungry!

    O/S deliveries sent to me (100+ legitimate and a handful from SR) tend to hover around the 25 day mark, although a lot have arrived sooner, and a few have turned up ridiculously quickly.

    I will sound like a broken record here, but the less people say about specifics, the more mail will come through.

    If your package gets lost and you come and say "THIS AWESOME VENDOR WHO ALWAYS PACKS HIS SHIT IN BLOW UP DOLLS UP THEIR ASS FROM SUCH AND SUCH SEX COMPANY ISN'T GETTING THROUGH ANY MORE, EVEN THOUGH HE IS USING THE LATEST TECHNIQUES THAT LE DON'T KNOW ABOUT!!!!" maybe you should reconsider your wise words, grasshopper.

    As to English vs Australian women, I love 'em both. But... If you lived in England, where it gets to about 20 degrees celcius in the summer, would you have a "fit" figure like the Australians who (in some parts) have winters of 20 degrees?

    It's done to death, but personality trumps looks, get both and you're Doing It Right.

    Interesting results on this, it would appear that there is something afoot in the land of the Kangaroo which is slowing things up and it can't be some sort of rip-off because it's spread across too many people and thus too many vendors. Perhaps Australia's security Kangaroos are kicking it up a gear.  ::)

    I dont understand how one vendor from the UK can be having no problems at all, like my gear is arriving swiftly. The packaging is the average, so you would think it would be more unlikely to get through  , yet its turn up within a few day of when im expecting it. But so many other people are having trouble, maybe im just the lucky one....

    I dunno, this is why I'm trying to work out why some are taking so long. I had a look through and the ones that are late are mostly Australian.  :-\ I dunno whether to chalk it up to it being the Olympics or if it's Australian people rummaging more rigorously. If ya have a look it's not just mine, it seems to be Australia in general no matter where its coming from.

    I still haven't seen much to convince me that the late/non-arrival of shipments isn't an issue with the vendor for the vast majority of instances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure, there's going to always be cunts that try and scam, and of course you can always chalk up some as that, but that's not a 'geographically specific' phenomenon.  There's just as many scammers in the NL as there are in AU or UK or wherever.  Intuitively, I think most Aussies on here are fucking so chuffed at the global prices here, we're happy to pay 500% less than street prices, so you could argue the scam factor is lowered becasue of this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've noticed a handful of vendors either selling stuff they clearly don't have, and worse, marking packages as sent that they haven't sent.  Vendors recently have put killer deals up and not removed them once they've actually sold all their stock on hand, meaning they instantly go into a cashflow/stock blackhole.  And when things go astray, they haven't communicated to their customers what has happened and given them options.  Some vendors have been fucking arseholes recently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other theory I have is thus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AU is difficult to send to, because our shipping is expensive, and I'm guessing we're ordering smaller amounts (just a guess) so on the grand pecking order, we're on the bottom.  We're also vocal complainers and don't take shit, so if a vendor fucks up, we're more likely to call them out.
    <br/>
    So, what we have - being last on some vendors shit list - is a ripe opportunity for maginalising us and justifying the move by some vendors to not only put us in the 'too-hard' basket, but also add a justification for compulsory FE'ing and no refunds.  This then opens us up to being defrauded, and the cycle continues - we complain, they justify unreasonable T&amp;C, we open ourselves up to being defrauded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've seen absolutely nothing to suggest that our customs is any different to anyone elses, but some vendors insist our customs people are some super organism that's half dog half spider with x-ray vision or some such shit.  Where's the evidence our customs people are magicians, when I can order a dozen or more times from Ivory and it all gets here within 7-9 days? There's nowhere farther away than the fucking UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I largely think we're just being put in the 'too-hard' basket and getting a fucking bum rap, and being made to pay for the privilege.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's at the point now where I'm not even going to bother experimenting anymore with anyone who has deals, or anyone vaguely new, because we're now prime targets for being fucked. I have my 6 or so pro vendors who know how to put a fucking envelope in the mail box, and I'm going to stick with them.

    I just had a scour of the forums and found a thread where 1000 people wrote in saying how many shipments they'd lost, and the result was essentially a 98% success rate.  Supports my theory of dodgy vendors even further.

    Im awaiting my 1st 2 orders from OS right now, havent had much communication except, 'it has been sent sir', but everything else ive ever bought, 30 or so items thru ebay etc, from UK and US, took a week at most, occasionally a bit over a week.
    <br/>
    As for customs, I wont risk ordering from certain geo. areas, and I wont be comfortable ordering illicit  drugs either, but im going to have to soon. When I say illicit , i mean, non-prescription. I think you'd find stealthy orders of pharmaceutical orders would almost always make it through, dogs are to focused on the big 3 or 4 scoops they love to show off every now &amp; then.
    <br/>
    If I do get caught, man, im doing this because the media made a big fucking deal about Benzos, ,my Dr cut me off, so I have to buy it from an old friend in XXXland. They'll send me to the D&amp;A centre for help. ! thing about Australia, ..gotta love the legal system.
    <br/>
    In US, I'd be in county lockup for forgetting to take my valium out of the car.

Then a few hours later there's the tube ride, absolutely shitface and it's only mid arvo, only to rock up at the Walkabout, quickly into the dunnie for some charlie and another pill or two, and then it's time to HIT THE SNAKEBITES HARD!   :)

    Anyone with a decent rating seen a package/envelope to USA to Aus just entirely vanish? An incredibly small envelope sized delivery is now at 3 weeks (15 working days) from a trusted non-SR contact so I'm 100% its not a scam. I've had perfect delivery from all over the world and various vendors up until this point and was expecting a love letter at worst. Max delivery time I've seen is 7 working days worldwide before. Also its not something that is likely to be picked up by dogs, it would have to be opened and physically searched.

    I've heard this as well. Previously orders have been going through with 100% success, recently, since a media beat up and a huge group of busts and seizes they are tight on the post. Alot of people having been complaining of molly not joining them however charlie seems to be coming through fine...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree with Limetless that the heat will eventually die down when they either break their budget, find other objectives to occupy them with or prove to everyone that what they have done has worked and they have "set their example". It's inconvenient in the meantime however...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think there was a "$20m heroin seizure" that had come through the mail, but that came from the media and you know the media...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please package well vendors :)

    Yep..another one with their hand up.. first few orders were all good from various EU vendors ( 7-10 days ) , but now looking grim. Latest ones are 22 days  and 12 days respectively, again from different vendors/locales.. even switched up the delivery address for the last one.

    Have had 6 letters not come through to 3 different addresses had a reship from one seller and it was tracked and they still got it cunts... 1700 later, i think it has a fair bit to do with vendors not doing things very careful. ie: to be stealth, pack product in a seperate bag completely away from vacuuming sealing bags.. even do vacuum sealing in another room if you can.. its not rocket science dust particles will be get onto everything, and dogs will smell it no problem, i have received product from various vendors in different countries and most seem to not double vacuum or put product in a seperate bag first and quite a few times i have received stuff it has had pruduct on the outside of vacuum bag, i guess i was lucky to receive those but since they have stepped up checking and with dogs at customs then of course we wont receive our shit, come on vendors do it right not sloppy..

    No problems here. 8 days out of EU.

    I agree with furore, I think it has a lot to do with how much effort vendors are willing to put into their packaging techniques.
    <br/>
    The package I received was very well thought out and professional. Much better than previous packaging that has gone missing/never turned up from other EU vendors. That being said, all issues with missing packages have been resolved without any hiccups :)

    Guys.. need some insight on what may be happening with mail screening. Do you reckon its being ramped up just for flagged countries, or is it across the board and they are trying to check all OS mail coming in to AU? I tend to think that the latter is a bridge too far for LE, but who knows just how anal they want to get? Thoughts..?

    lost and loosin shite loads. gunna stop orderin 4 a few or more months . I THINK alot or most vendors/sellers aren't sending .they're takin advantage of a sticky sittuation  . i'm seeing them open old now unused accounts to do it with too.       BUT the main thing im noticing is being treated like a lyer or thief when ever a enquiry is made {at a fair time ,usually after second time extension,and done in polite mutually benifficial manner} about the whereabouts of an order.  whats the use of a rep sys. when ya still treated bad regardless of the rep u have. at this rate we'll all be straight and drug free sheep in no time ,  and ive had letters from customs b4 from other things bought off SR legally or illegaly small amounts too , AUSSIES BOYCOT ANY VENDOR DEMANDING FE &gt; THEY"LL STOP IF WE ALL DO. we do matter to em more than they make out we do. GOOD LUCK ALL. and stop tellin the straightys wat ya doin . the less news play sr  gets the better. take care ,love learn and  let the goodtimes roll on.

    Mail from overseas is definitely still arriving in Oz. I personally won't at this point order from the Netherlands due to packages from certain countries, such as the Netherlands, being flagged as a drug hot spot and attracting some unwanted attention from Customs. A vendors packaging is the key to items arriving. Through trial and error, I now have a few vendors which I only use to get my shit safely here to Oz. There are vendors on SR who will take care and effort in packaging their goods to ensure delivery and there are some who just slap it together and say fuck it, that's good enough. Do your research and make some inquiries. :)

    I like hearing that the UK mail is still getting through, even if it is severely delayed.  It gives me hope for an order i've been waiting 15 days for. This is from a vendor that's always been 7 to 9 days in the past.  Lets hope the extra checks are just temporary and that everyone is choosing from vendors who put a lot of effort into packaging very discreetly.

    I've spent over $1500 on this site and haven't had any serious delays, also every order has made it. The longest it's ever taken is 2 weeks from Belgium. I find the quickest countries are other commonwealth countries like the UK and Canada, they only take a week. With that being said I tend to order random things and haven't ordered much overseas in the past month (the one order from Belgium. Hope this helps.

    That's very worrying. What countries did you order from? What products? Which vendors? These could all be factors but nonetheless it's worrying whatever the case. Is it possible mail was taken from your drop places? They're hard to monitor.

    I am having the same problem as everyone else... Ordered a few things almost 2 months ago now. Still waiting on 3 letters and 2 packages. The last of them should have arrived around the end of last month. Not sure whether to worry or not, does anyone know how long the fed's would take to organize a controlled delivery if they picked up on something? I figured they would get straight onto it if they wanted to catch us. However if they had found the packages and destroyed what was in them, we would still have received a letter from customs. And the only other option is that someone has stolen it... Which I believe is highly unlikely.

    I have a tip for you all that will see your success rate sky rocket...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And since trying this trick I am now convinced that vendors are just straight out selectively scamming the shit out of aussies due to all the hype/threads/reviews about customs blitz and packages not arriving.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically there is 'free' money to be made from 'selectively scamming' peeps, as many silk roaders are first timers/newbs and willing to 'give it a try' but dont expect much. So when they dont get their order they blow it all off as 'oh well there goes that little experiment'. But to those that are active on SR and keep contact with vendors on their order will more often than not get a full refund or be taken seriously. Their money is made from those that dont ever bother chasing up a failed order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So how do you make yourself less of a target to be selectively scammed? Let the vendors know straight up that you are an experienced Silk Roader and will not tolerate being selectively scammed. Say you will always follow up problem orders and will ALWAYS post reviews/comments on both SR and forums regarding your experience. Also state that if you are happy you will gladly leave 5/5 glowing review, but if scammed and/or dissatisfied will leave only accept 100% refund or reship. Also state that if vendor is only willing to give you 50% refund then they will only get maximum 4/5.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do this in the address field before leaving my address. Short concise non-personal message/disclaimer such as:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Note to ALL vendors considering 'selective scamming' me: DONT. I will actively follow up EVERY transaction and happily leave full 5/5 positive review for any received orders, but orders not received and with poor follow up offer at resolution will only receive 5/5 for full refund or reship. Furthermore NEGATIVE review will be left on SR and in forums based on any negative experience. Apologies to all genuine vendors, but being an Aussie I have found myself scammed one too many times I feel this is a necessary prenuptial. Thanks and PLUR"

    tracked packages, for me, are the only way i can keep aussies happy.  to be honest, the delivery time doesn't seem to be much different.  there seems to be only a couple differences in EMS, UPS, USPS Priority, and DHL.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Priority sometimes gets there about the same time.
    <br/>
    2. Tracked packages cut down on customer service effort by tremendously.
    <br/>
    3. It is better to NOT know the package is sitting in customs (ie FCM/Priority) than to sit there and watch your express package in customs for 4/5 days.  Even more stressful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i sent two packages sent on the same day (8/7) one via EMS, and the other UPS.  the UPS arrived today.   EMS still not delivered.   i'd highly prefer to not send tracked packages, but until people can be patient and understand the postal system in oz is at fault..... then this is where we are.   i cringe at thinking one of my customers actually gets a package seized because of this.    and because of that, my packaging is taking so much time that it is impacting everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but aussies are good customers, and so far pretty honest.   or no worse than anybody else.  just impatient, just like buyers from everywhere!

    Face it. It doesn't matter if it's customs, customers or vendors at fault - LE is winning this war.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The poll here is fast reaching 50% failure rate for Australians. That means SR is effectively broken in this regard. At that rate, all SR users are going to be burned financially and/or flagged by LE within TWO purchases. I don't like those odds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are loads of good ideas I can think of to help, but unlike the vendors comms this forum is effectively public. Talking strategy here is like trying to organise your drug deals in the foyer of a police station. You really shouldn't do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If any vendors step up to the plate honestly and start looking after the aussies, they can charge a premium for Australian postage + stealth to cover seizures and not demand FE, They'll make a motza and a strong southern fan base. Use the SR system properly maybe?

    To be perfectly honest, I'd be happy to pay $70 a gram for good molly and go as far to say another $30 on top of that for super stealth packaging. I am an honest buyer and at the end of the day if I pay $30-$50 for premium postage and still come out cheaper than buying locally I will be contempt. If i bought 2g's at those rates I'd be set back $180-$200 which is still cheaper than anything on the aussie domestic market...ridiculous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SuperTrips and other big time NL vendors have clearly stated packaging to AUS takes far too much time and so $2000 transactions are required to be worthwhile, I definitely think things would be different if smaller orders had a $30-$50 packaging fee to overcome this.

    Hell I'd pay extra to cover "anti-scam insurance" so I know the seller was happy with their profit, did definitely post it and therefore if it doesn't arrive I know it wasn't them, which means I should burn the address. But given some of the missing packages around here, don't think there's enough addresses in town if we all dump them every time.

    The bigger problem with scammers isn't the lost money, it's the fact that you should change addresses just to be sure it wasn't. That ain't that easy now is it.

     Not that you asked me Limpdick, but I'd say if it's come to it, try making your in-escrow policy a bit more exclusive first. I'd say selling from UK, especially with RC's should have the best rate of getting through.

     Just speaking from experience, I generally cross a vendor off my list if they require FE. But this is just really a theory to see if it is buyers scamming you, if you did that and your numbers stayed the same then I can't really see an alternative.

    Yeah but the thing is with the RCs I am flipping to Meph and Ket soon with possibly MDMA + MDA. The RCs that I'll be retaining will probably be 4-ACO and maybe M1 and MXE. Also I'll be bumping up to wholesale amount too and I'll be able to put KG+ amounts through the escrow system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I am thinking is something like this -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wholesale purchases - Must be established buyer for escrow and seizure losses are split 50/50 between myself and customer
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Previous Australian buyers (Yourself, Hoff and the others and my regulars) - Full Escrow
    <br/>
    <br/>
    New Australian buyers with 10+ purchases and 0 refunds/autofinalizes - Full Escrow
    <br/>
    <br/>
    New Australian buyers with less than the above - FE
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you think?

    Good, shall implement it later then. I don't want to cut out Australia altogether by any means in fact I like being one of the few that ship there successfully (delivery rated to Australia are around 85%) but I do need to tweak it a little.

    Last week I received a seizure notice for quite a lot of something i didn't order. Quite concerning. I contacted the only vendor i have dealt with who sells that product and provided him the seizure notice (as i haven't received any of the 3 packages i ordered from him over 6 weeks ago).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is all becoming too hard... too big a headache for me to deal with anymore.

    This is getting out of hand! I've had 3 order over the last two months not arrive.
    <br/>
    2 were from the EU and 1 from CAN which is in resolution now. One of the EU orders was re-shipped to a different addy and still has not arrive.
    <br/>
    I would almost be happy to somehow incentivise vendors for successful delivery (pay extra coins and include tracking), but if unsuccessful then I'd expect 100% refund.

    Based on "thisisn'tme's pos in the shipping thread regarding dogs,, it would seem that by leaving mail around for 5-10 days, it makes it much easier to identify. It may be why so much is being intercepted now and average delivery times are going up by 5-10 days.

    Customs just wait until the molecules leak through.

    There are different grades of plastic that can be used. I wonder if that would help.

    Okay, here's the problem with partial refunds - the buyer cops the loss.  As a seller you'd be better off having a zero loss / zero profit transaction than asking the buyer to lose money, yeah? So as far as I'm concerned, refunds are bullshit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Geez, why don't people get this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is why we're copping it in the arse.  I've posted this numerous times now. Picture the scenario:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seller drops price, influx of orders, not enough product or cashflow.  Decides not to ship to AU, makes you finalise early, doesn't ship your product, gets a month's buffer to beat up about 'how difficult' Australia is, blah blah blah, maybe eventually gives you 50% of your money back and gets to keep the product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The buyer gets screwed, and in the process the seller gets to minimise the damage to his supply and cashflow, and you help him pay for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is what I don't understand about Teh Intarwebs......it's just like real life.  The same rules apply, including those of commerce.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you ordered a toaster and it never arrived, would you ask for a 50% refund?  Fuck no.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fellas, we're getting fucked over here.  We're making excuses because we're (sometimes) getting our shit super cheap and minus the hassle of buying it on the streets or from friends-of-friends-of-friends or whatever, but if you're an honest guy, don't be lulled into believing the myth that's attempting to be created here - that we're all a bunch of scumbags and our Customs is from the fucking planet Krypton.

     However, if this is your fear, Just pay the extra for tracking, alot of guys do it.. From Canada tracking is expenisve. $80 or something.. from Europe there is cheaper tracking.. Not all of them do it, but enough do.

     <br/>
     Who cares if you have to sgin for it, you can sign for letters that arent addressed to u.

      However, if this is your fear, Just pay the extra for tracking, alot of guys do it.. From Canada tracking is expenisve. $80 or something.. from Europe there is cheaper tracking.. Not all of them do it, but enough do.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Who cares if you have to sgin for it, you can sign for letters that arent addressed to u.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This should alleviate your selective scamming fears.

     Tracking is always good and we always use it for larger orders of our premium products. We will use tracked shipping for our latest Matrix™ 250ug LSD Vial's product.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BTW... These Vial's will be a regular addition to our products and we will be happy to ship them international.

    Matrix, do you think you'll ever list gram's of mdma powder/crystal? If you found molly as potent as your psychedelic stock you would be one extremely busy vendor, actually, you probably are anyway.  Justsayin  ;D

    Thanks for the feeback Railingcapz!
    <br/>

    We did have some awesome Matrix™ MDMA 150mg Capsules which sold out within hours of being listed and we may have them back again very shortly... Matrix™ MDMA grams could also be on the horizon if we chase this great source up :D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And answer to your question... Yes, we are very damn busy at the moment with our Matrix™ Psychadelic range, we love our work.

      Okay, here's the problem with partial refunds - the buyer cops the loss.  As a seller you'd be better off having a zero loss / zero profit transaction than asking the buyer to lose money, yeah? So as far as I'm concerned, refunds are bullshit.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Geez, why don't people get this?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This is why we're copping it in the arse.  I've posted this numerous times now. Picture the scenario:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Seller drops price, influx of orders, not enough product or cashflow.  Decides not to ship to AU, makes you finalise early, doesn't ship your product, gets a month's buffer to beat up about 'how difficult' Australia is, blah blah blah, maybe eventually gives you 50% of your money back and gets to keep the product.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The buyer gets screwed, and in the process the seller gets to minimise the damage to his supply and cashflow, and you help him pay for it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This is what I don't understand about Teh Intarwebs......it's just like real life.  The same rules apply, including those of commerce.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If you ordered a toaster and it never arrived, would you ask for a 50% refund?  Fuck no.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Fellas, we're getting fucked over here.  We're making excuses because we're (sometimes) getting our shit super cheap and minus the hassle of buying it on the streets or from friends-of-friends-of-friends or whatever, but if you're an honest guy, don't be lulled into believing the myth that's attempting to be created here - that we're all a bunch of scumbags and our Customs is from the fucking planet Krypton.

     The difference might be that when you order a toaster off a large legitimate company it is 100% insured against loss. When you decide to import 50 grams of mdma into Australia from an overseas drug dealer, advertising their wares on a black market website on a hidden service, there may be some risk involved, no?

    You have enough margin in the product to cover loss, that's how it works, isn't it?
