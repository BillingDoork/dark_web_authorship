     For those of you concerned about your face on a camera, you can always take the time to construct a infra-red LED hat.  Search it out on the surface web.  Pretty easy to do, involves a 9 volt battery, some wires, and some infra-red LEDs near your face on the underside of the hat.  Makes your face look like a glowing ball of light to a camera, but not visible to the human eye.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As for the rest of yourself, change your outfit every time you go, and to make it even harder to track you, use different facilities.  IE don't follow a pattern.

    The footage on the clearnet of dudes trying this out is amazing... Instead of a recognisable face, all you can see on the screen is a glowing blob of light.....
    <br/>
    Don't think they're any good in the day time though....  I reckon they'd work on number plates too.....
    <br/>
    I'm fucken sick of those bloody new pig vans with the special camera on it that can tell if you've farted anytime in the last 10 years. A couple of annoying unpaid fines and some gear in the card can really put you in the  shizen.

    are the lights actually invisible to the human eye? or are they lighting up blue because its filmed through a camera?

    IR is completely invisible to the human eye but will light up bright on a camera.
    <br/>
    They will also light up with night vision.
    <br/>
    This is a very good idea, my first thought as well was adding these to license plates.

    Looks like I'm off to the hardware store.

    I am not an expert by any chance but I know that some cameras have IR filters. Especially those intended for day time surveillance.

    I have no idea about cctv cameras though, just do some research to be sure before you buy.

    IR filtering does raise the bar for how much IR you have to output but it doesnt make it impossible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's another idea, make a burning laser flashlight and fry their cameras, then come back the next day and deliver.

    One issue with frying the sensors with the dvd laser flashlight is that its very visible, might be kinda hard to shine that in the PO without anyone noticing....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Heres a better solution if u got the cash (u should since ur a dealer)

    I see some flaws with that idea:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Won't you be the last thing that the camera records before its sensor is destroyed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How can you be sure the sensor is destroyed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What if the recording is watched by a security guy in real time?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Overall, this idea is a bit of hocus-pocus to me.

    i think you might be confusing IR infared light with UV ultraviolet, the wattages used in small led IR lights isnt going to do much to your eye.  remember ir is felt as heat...

    I'd assume you'd probably get a few different CCTV cameras that are commonly used, maybe one with extra IR filtration, and test your laser on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look im not suggesting walking into a PO with an invisible 1.5W laser, chances are you'll end up setting someones hair on fire before you actually take down their cameras, but maybe you run into a situation where a camera is pointed in your direction and you either walk into and get caught or you destroy it without anyone noticing. Just an idea, i think the real question here is how you aim an invisible laser.....

      IR is damaging to the human eye. Don't orient them towards your face. Just something to think about. Fucking excellent idea tho!

     i think you might be confusing IR infared light with UV ultraviolet, the wattages used in small led IR lights isnt going to do much to your eye.  remember ir is felt as heat...

    Damn! I came to this thread fully expecting there to be a place I could purchase one of these!  Hopefully some vendor will offer a few of these for sale in the near future.

    This is a rehash of an old idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is a video of this on you tube...although they end product could have been much better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There was a thread on THESE forums about this a while ago also - at which point I personally was commissioned to build one for somebody.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That person never turned up, I never built it and even though I had intended to still build some - now I simply do not have the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If made correctly a device like this could be totally effective - if made even a bit less it will be total crap.

    IR Hats are useless in daylight.  Only work in dim lit areas and IR Leds depending on which you get have a small angle.  18degrees or 40degrees.  40degree arent very bright and 18deg do not cover much of the area.  So unless you kill the lights before you go in, this is not feasible.  And yes I have 40 leds from the last one i made.  Im a tinkerer lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IR will not work for license plates.  will work for most cctv systems though, atleast the ones I tried where I knew the owner. But again had to be dark (i.e. outside doing stuff) walking into the store that was brightly lit did not work well.
