    So im getting off work,stop by the PO Box and I was like wtf? It was an envelope but it wasnt addressed to me although it had my box number as the address. I looked up the name on it and apparently the person lives nearby in the same city, I also checked the from address and it appears to be similar to what would be inside the envelope. After checking this info out I assured myself that maybe the person forgot to update their address at work for this envelope to be sent to their new address. Im still a little paranoid about walking into the post office the next day to return it but I was like whatever if they are onto me just go ahead and get this shit over with since i returned it on my day off. I go to the counter and inform the clerk that I recieved this in my mail and I am assuming that it was the previous owners. The clerk took a look at it and said"oh well your ***** right" I say that is correct and the clerk tells me thank you and I am on my way to check the box for my expected delivery and it was there.

    LOL,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I thought all this time the people that lived in the house before me had the name Residents, that makes sense since I always thought Current was a funny 1st name.

    1) im a little noid about drugs in the mail as i am still new to this and am currently ordering different drugs in different quantiites.
    <br/>
    2) no i do not think i am the person that broke that po boxs' hymen
    <br/>
    3) im glad we are on the same page but i was 50/50 on the idea that the previous owner didnt update their address for this envelope that appeared to have sensitive information inside as it related to their job
    <br/>
    4)Â  i was thinking that my usual vendor either shipped later than what the in transit date said(usually i recieve my item within 2days instead of 3days because of our location to each other)
    <br/>
    5) i figured that the feds might know something bcuz: the letter was sensitive information,my usual vendor was a day late,also their is a police station literally less than 200ft away and it would be easy for one of them to pose as a customer grabbing thier mail until i arrived.
    <br/>
    My bad for wasting peoples time but i just figured that similar situations might have happened where there was actually a bust or someone attributed this to the start of an investigation.
