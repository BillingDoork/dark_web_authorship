    I've heard numerous people say to "not bother" getting cannabis shipped given how easy it is to detect (bothering implying acceptable local supply, I guess - lucky people). Yet obviously there is a booming trade in this very thing. Is there a consensus on this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assuming adequate stealth (nothing genius, nothing incompetent) and domestic shipping, how much more at risk is a package containing mj? Is there a consensus on this? Let's presume double or triple vac seal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are there other products that are particularly detectible? Can anyone suggest a hierarchy of risk?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The answer could suggest the best way to go about ordering multiple items - if mj puts a package at substantially greater risk, you wouldn't want it shipped with something that is otherwise very likely to make it through, like LSD (for eg).

    I'm really interested in this and want to give a better response, but I can't really offer more than my opinion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think, if packing methods and local screening arrangements were excluded, the factors affecting risk of detection would be:
    <br/>
    Bulk (both inherent bulk of the product and quantity ordered)
    <br/>
    Detectability (human, canine, technology assisted)
    <br/>
    Attractiveness (is it a 'target' drug?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cannabis is bulky (compared to powders), and is often ordered in large quantities because of the prices involved.
    <br/>
    A lot of LE resources are attuned to detecting cannabis, because it's so ubiquitous. Bulk means it's visually easy to detect (and it can be smelt too, if the packaging is poor). Canines are ridiculously good at detecting cannabis. Not sure what technological detection like X-ray or 'drug sniffers' (particle detection units, not sure what the proper name is) would do, but I would imagine that organic matter in general stands out well from normal mail.
    <br/>
    Cannabis is (for some bizarre reason) high on LEO lists of drugs to go after, but in many places the sentencing is softer than drugs like heroin or cocaine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Compare the above points to what I'd consider the safest  thing to ship, LSD blotters:
    <br/>
    Not bulky at all, tiny in fact, even in large quantities we're only talking a sheet of paper.
    <br/>
    Difficult to detect, canines are not usually trained to detect LSD, technology may be attuned to LSD but I don't know of any specific examples
    <br/>
    LSD is medium-low on LE list of drugs to go after, in my opinion.

    Well, I've been doing some reading. It was next to impossible to search for this topic as I framed it, but realizing that my main concern was canine, I focused on past threads dealing with canine sensitivity, as I know there were some, and I found the grandaddy/momma of such beasts:

    I have no idea why that thread is not stickied.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Main things learned:
    <br/>
    - there does appear to be a hierarchy, with MDMA at the top and mj next (at least for that police dog)
    <br/>
    - vacuum sealing can be worse than sealing without vacuum - as someone put it, vac sealing seems to have become "the new coffee and fabric softener" (I'm beginning to think of it as "anti-security theatre")
    <br/>
    - external contamination can ruin otherwise good packaging - and I would personally note that buyers will be typically unable to assess this aspect whatsoever
    <br/>
    - the specific numbers which are daunting:

    This is pretty serious. I would love to see a voluntary vendor association committed to better/safer standards, with specific commitments to packaging type and clean room practice. I'd pay extra to buy from one of them. I'm sure a lot of people would.

    Wow THANK YOU!!! Very much these are amazing finds! They will definitely help with my practice on a daily basis.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How ever I have recently sent a cann abis  item along with other similar items at the same time, it was considered a    pro vincial    not a    nat ional.  the other items have arrived on time, however this one package has now been in transit for 6 days, Im sure smell will start seeping through, hopefully the package finds its way in 2 days or else im not sure what happened to it. the return address is not a big deal but its not 100%
    <br/>
    any ideas just lose it or wait it out? at this point im undecided but I just want to do things the right way.

    You might be surprised at just how many top tiered vendors go overboard to make sure that their packaging would clear these "sniff tests."

    That's what I'm beginning to suspect, having received my first package from a pillar of SR and seeing how packaging is really done. Wow. My standards have just shifted considerably.
