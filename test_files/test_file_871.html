    Guys, I think I'm fucked. Mostly because I have multiple packages coming to my address and pretty sure the one they came asking about was the first one. I'm sure the second one is also in the mail and I have no way of stopping that. What should I do?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I followed all the standard procedure...deny deny deny. But since my address is now flagged how I am supposed to explain the next package that comes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cleaned out the house, but besides that I dunno what else to do.

    Deny, deny, deny, is the biggest one. You already cleaned your house but really take a good look ANYWHERE you think there might be parephanelia. I've had friends think their houses are squeaky clean, get searched, and the cops found the smallest thing to pin them on.

    If the packages get delivered, don't accept them and return to sender.

    This happened to me a while back with a few pills I had ordered to the house. Package was shown to be delivered but I didn't receive any mail. My guess is that it was delivered to the wrong house by mistake and I never got the package returned to me (and of course I couldn't report it). Vendor was sympathetic but declined to reship or refund, which I totally understand, but it sucks nonetheless that I lost a few bucks. That's now why I ship to a separate address where it isn't possible to end up somewhere else.

    <br/>
    A- keep denying
    <br/>
    B- get a lawyer lined up
    <br/>
    C- don't give out any more info on a forum about this

    Woah dude. I know we're supposed to be all gangstas and shit, but in many countries, most cops are just doing their job and are trying to do it right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know it's not the same everywhere and that, in some places, they're corrupt pigs. But I've been to many countries where I've been quite happy to have them around. You know, those countries where they serve and protect and where they routinely put their lives on the line to protect the innocent (including our sorry addict asses, our mothers, our sisters, our kids, our dogs...), so I don't think they all deserve such harsh words just because they enforce laws we do not agree with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, those still voting and clinging to their war on drugs laws... Those should be strapped to chairs, amped up, and forced to watch days in a row of endless bothersome documentaries about the alcohol prohibition in the US, how it never stopped anyone from drinking, made the mafia rich, and got things worse for everyone. We could have them watch "The Wire" too. It would probably send the message better, but that wouldn't really be torture anymore.

    I admit that there are cops out there that want to make the world a better place, but if they think it's actually going to happen in their lifetime then they are just completely deluded. If cops don't like being cops and don't like the laws they are told to enforce, then they can just quit being cops. There are plenty of other careers to choose from - start vending on SR for one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they are stupid enough to actually enjoy the power trip given to them and think that the war on drugs is actually winnable, then they deserve any flak coming their way and I've got plenty to give because they've never helped me once, not even when i needed it, they have gone out their way to hinder my existence every chance they've had - so Fuck 'em - I wouldn't piss on one if it was on fire. I'd break out the Marshmallows and Cocoa.

    I don't know many people who are enjoying every single part of their jobs. You can be a cop, disagree with some drug or traffic laws, and still enjoy preventing an assault, sending a rapist to jail, and hoping to get upgraded to homicide someday.

    If those packages get delivered (and to be honest they probably will) then be very careful removing them from the mailbox.  If you're in the US they might have GPS tracking.  Don't get your fingerprints on the packages, make sure you aren't being watched, and make sure the packages doesn't go into your house/car.

    You don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, you think taxes fund police departments?  Aheheheheheheheheheheh......  that's hilarious.  Oh, yeah, it's in the budget, all right, for sure.  But, as a former member of said 12-man SWAT team, let me fucking tell you - my badass gear was 100% funded by drug money.  And 99% percent of our raids were for - you guessed it - the narcotics division.  Raid the house, secure the house, and maintain security while the narcs search the house.  I know what $1 mil+ in cash looks like (not that much, actually, in mostly 100s).  And, our take was about $700k.  From one raid.  The following month, the department got a bunch of new cars.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've said it on many threads, and I will say it again.  Drug interdiction is the biggest industry in law enforcement.  Between that and federal funding for anti-terrorism, today's cops are awash in cash.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THAT's why the SWAT team (depends on your criminal record and how many gun permits you've applied for whether it's the SWAT team, actually) comes through your door.  Because behind your door might be their meal ticket.

    Even if multiple packages are arriving.. I'm not sure that makes much of a difference in this case? Since you're going to deny any connection to the first package.. you can use it to your advantage that more packages are getting seized by saying there's obviously somebody hell bent on getting you in trouble. Look, a gram of coke from New York, some molly from arizona, the bastard even sent me 50 oxies from Florida! I don't even know anyone those states officer!  If they can't prove you ordered them.. and how could they due to the anonymity/encrypted nature of SR.. more packages doesn't necessarily mean "more trouble".  IMO atleast.

    Everyone is suggesting you deny and/or lie to the cops, but I really don't think that's the best possible idea.  Just say something along the lines of "My apologies as I'm not trying to be uncooperative and know you're just doing your job, but I have a policy that I don't converse with the police w/o my lawyer present."

    Too much.  Everything you say can be used against you in court.  Oh, you have a policy?  Organizations have policies.  Are you a part of an organization?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Officers, I am exercising my 5th amendment right to silence and my 6th amendment right to an attorney."  Obviously, this only works in the States.  Cops know those laws, and they know them fairly well.  They won't ask you any more questions after that.  Now, if you actually do have a lawyer you can call, that'd be the coolest, like if you pay to have one on retainer; otherwise it may be awhile before you see one.  But, the questioning will stop.  By law, it has to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This applies ONLY if you are in custody, meaning you feel as if you can't leave.  If they just knock on your door and want to talk to you, and you feel like you have the full right to tell them to leave, then do that.  Tell them you are busy at the moment, and would they please leave.  It is then you will discover whether or not you're in custody.  If they refuse to leave, or push their way in, or touch you (don't resist them), then exercise your 5th and 6th amendments as soon as either (a) they ask you any questions or (b) they Mirandize you (read you your rights).  Basically, be a mute.  Make them prove their case; don't give them anything.

    This is a good point, but I think it can be better clarified... The idea is that denying something can come back to bite you, typically in terms of being able to prove that you are a liar.  Once you're a liar in the eyes of LE, nothing you say is true.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is why, instead of DENYING you politely say, "I am not making any statements without my attorney present." or if you want the long version...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    tattoo this on your fucking arms...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "If I am under arrest, please tell me on what charges, and if I am not, I wish to end this conversation/encounter and go freely on my way. I refuse to consent to a search of my person, my property, vehicle, or effects without a valid warrant. I wish to remain silent and to have my attorney present during any questioning."

    Yeah....great idea; soooo gangsta.  See where that logic takes you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As stated before: Clean house, mouth shut, lawyer up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is such a simple concept, yet no one seems able to stick to it.  Just remember, they aren't as scary(or as kind) as they seem, be cordial but keep your mouth shut.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Part of this battle is showing them we can be just as polite and level headed as any politician worth his salt to the establishment when we're under pressure. We have to prove we aren't just a bunch of rebellious(i use that term very lightly) druggies who are gonna try and smooth talk our way out of things, then resort to name calling when we think they aren't listening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully it wasn't a large enough amount to even worry about.  Good vibes in any case.

     Guys, I think I'm fucked. Mostly because I have multiple packages coming to my address and pretty sure the one they came asking about was the first one. I'm sure the second one is also in the mail and I have no way of stopping that. What should I do?

    Of course, your first mistake was opening your door.  I'm surprised they didn't just smell something and search your place right there.

    There isn't one.  But, if there's a strong smell of weed, and the cops come knocking, your options are limited.  If they hear you running around in there trying to get rid of the weed they smell, they can kick the door in under the exigent circumstances rule.  If they don't hear you as you quietly open your windows and chuck or hide or flush your weed, they can sit on the door, and call for a search warrant based on the smell.  I mean, they came to your door for a reason, after all.

    DO NOT even lie. Say nothing except 'lawyer'. If you lie and they discover the lie (and they will; if you have ever been interviewed by police you will know that they will take apart everything you say in great detail) then that's just one more piece of evidence they can use against you. Do not attempt to outwit or out argue them. Just stay quiet

    I think playing stupid is the better way to go about this. Once you deny deny deny or yell I plead the 5th!, they will watch your ass like a hawk and more than likely find something. Ask them for their help in catching whoever sent this package and assist you in preventing any more from coming. Also, for god sake, do not have a house reeking of marijuana when you expect something such as a "package".

    Of coarse this all depends on how well you can twist words and fast you can think.

    It's best to never have more than one for reasons to OP spells out. If a package gets caught, and there are more on the way, then "I don't know what you're talking about officer" isn't going to be a decent defense, especially if the locations they are sent from are distant from each other, you're essentially left arguing that there's a nationwide/international conspiracy to frame you.

    Someone already mentioned this, but if you can deny one as someone fuckin with you, why not two or three?  If u use the excuse that you have enemies, crazy ex girlfriend or crazier current girlfriend wouldn't the frame up be better if its more than one package, or a shit ton all at once.  I would think the more u send at once is a better way to frame someone.

    I should point out that I have had basically zero dealings with LE in my life and my advice is worth much less than everyone here, but here's my two cents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're going to say you think you know who's doing it, then they're going to want you to name names. Not doing so on your part makes literally no sense if your story is true. Even if you were willing to do that to someone (and there's very few situations that I can think of in which this would be in any way ethical), it better be someone who's capable of carrying this out. Are the shipments international? Your crazy ex girlfriend has been having parcels sent from around the world? Obviously it's not impossible, but if I'm LE I'm hardly going to be convinced.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And further, assuming any of the packages have even somewhat decent stealth, the expensive nationwide/international conspiracy to frame you doesn't make much sense, since there was such a small chance LE would pick up on the shipments, they were probably ecstatic when they found it for this exact reason. This fact is what makes the "I know nothing about this" defense shaky even when there's only one package. It might work because you've been careful in your online security and because you DON'T have any more packages coming and there's simply no more evidence that you ordered it, but even then, if I'm LE I probably won't believe your story. If you have more packages coming, from distant locations, stealthily packed - I mean, would you believe it?

     Too much.  Everything you say can be used against you in court.  Oh, you have a policy?  Organizations have policies.  Are you a part of an organization?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Officers, I am exercising my 5th amendment right to silence and my 6th amendment right to an attorney."  Obviously, this only works in the States.  Cops know those laws, and they know them fairly well.  They won't ask you any more questions after that.  Now, if you actually do have a lawyer you can call, that'd be the coolest, like if you pay to have one on retainer; otherwise it may be awhile before you see one.  But, the questioning will stop.  By law, it has to.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This applies ONLY if you are in custody, meaning you feel as if you can't leave.  If they just knock on your door and want to talk to you, and you feel like you have the full right to tell them to leave, then do that.  Tell them you are busy at the moment, and would they please leave.  It is then you will discover whether or not you're in custody.  If they refuse to leave, or push their way in, or touch you (don't resist them), then exercise your 5th and 6th amendments as soon as either (a) they ask you any questions or (b) they Mirandize you (read you your rights).  Basically, be a mute.  Make them prove their case; don't give them anything.

    Seeing that this has been updated, I thought I'd let you guys know that I'm good. Think my case fell through the cracks and I got lucky somehow.

    correct that to "I'm not expecting any packages (pig)"
    <br/>
    because he might become suspicious that you mentioned ordering when he mentioned the suspect package. Maybe not enough to get himself a warrant, but possibly enough to keep an eye on you instead of looking for the mystery mail thief.  "not expecting" vs "didn't order" is a simple change in words that drastically changes the perception of how much you already know about said package. You wouldn't say "I didn't order my phone bill or any birthday cards" and those could be the suspicious package being discussed.

    Why doesn't anyone order normal parcels and lots of them?
    <br/>
    You could profile your address as one that gets lots of parcels or lots of traffic normally.

    <br/>
    I mean really, we are in an ebay world these days. . even my parents are shopping online and getting parcels from around the world sent to them in little packages. .LOL

    Iv used SR 10mnths and for almost all of Nov and dec everyday of the week i had a package..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But iv for years orderd stuff off the net and ups/fedex so it s not like something new all of a sudden that all these packages are showing up..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best thing to do and i do it is, i put a red marker in my pocket and when i walk to the mailbox i always know if its a SR order or something else iv orderd legal cause i use my name with a middle Initial ( D) meaning drugs, so i know right off which is which, and i walk to my front porch sit there on my swing look through the mail and just in case im beeing watched i pick up the SR pack, and write 'RETURN TO SENDER"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    aLWAYS A good idea

    One day when you do have to face the police for a speeding fine or something, it will come back to haunt you.

    I disagree tango, I know of a situation where some people I know were all charged with the same offense, nothing too serious but in the time it took to come to trial the charges has changed from a civil to a crown offense.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    During that time one friend decided to get on with life and not respond to any calls to 'come in for questioning', they were under no obligation to do so either but the other friend came in for the chats, even returning from overseas work commitments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What happened, the friend who did the 'right thing' by coming in for the chats was remanded and got a custodial sentence for 18 months, paroled after 12 for good behavior and time spent on remand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other who ignored everything got nothing, they were pulled in for questioning 2 years later after a typical road traffic stop and check, they were arrested, they called a layer, the charges were dismissed almost immediately as there was no case to answer and they walked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Moral of this story, the law is corrupt and fuck the police, they only want to fuck you and anything you tell them will be used against you.

    My 1st instinct when reading these posts is to call bullshit. It seems 90% of the time it is. Though DrChong has been signed up to the forum since July 2012, not that 'that alone' means it's true. It's just more likely someone with a forum cred date that old would use it for a hoax.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That out of the way, have any of you legal experts in the US (or elsewhere) that know about these things, heard of the NDAA? The version signed into law by our cool hip "with it", President Obama, basically put the Bill of Rights in the shredder.

    All they have to "suspect" you of, is terrorism. No right to an attorney, no right to remain silent. No 1 phone call.

    So where do you stand legally if a package is sent to your address but not addressed to you? Surely LE can't do you for holding a package not in your name but sent to your address. I understand they could do you for stealing someone else mail if it didn't have your address on it tho, but it doesn't.

     So where do you stand legally if a package is sent to your address but not addressed to you? Surely LE can't do you for holding a package not in your name but sent to your address. I understand they could do you for stealing someone else mail if it didn't have your address on it tho, but it doesn't.

    The package is enough to get a search warrant and usually they find something in the house or somebody talks.  I suppose that they might arrest you and leave the question of constructive possession to a jury.  Hopefully not.  The police don't give a shit though.  If four people are in a car and they aren't sure who the drugs belong to then who do they arrest?  Everyone.  Assholes.

    +1 Damn skippy! Happen to me plenty of times back in the day..They know it's bullshit charge and it'll end up getting tossed..It's just the whole process of getting locked, getting bailed out, going to court...After after a few times it's fun anymore.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yeah, you can tell people not to open door, don't talk to the police, don't let them...Although they know this, when it happens they end up freezing and getting scared and don't do what they were drilled to do..At that once the "JAIL" bomb drops is when they crack.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What they don't understand..It's just lock up and not prison...As sam mentioned, by cracking and yapping that mouth will only get you into deeper shit..Always remember cops are bunch of bullshitters., ever get pulled over and they make it seem like everything you're saying is a lie? Well just think of it as they do and the nicest cop isn't always the nicest so don't get cozy, instead ask him for a smoke or a burger....I always did with the suburban cops and 50% of time I got a good meal and cigarette after. If you're scared just don't talk, they'll catch the fear and mess with you more..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember it's only lockup , you can get bail the same day if it's not late.

    I spouted off at Democrats, because they elected the guy! Can't pin that one on the Republicans, but guess what, I will! - I blame George W Bush, he was a socialist, though today's socialist controlled democrat party, would never want to give him that "compliment". W gave us Obama, but enough about the criminal in the White House.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where do I stand on the package not being addressed to me? I don't. I guess I have to read the thread back again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was making the point that the NDAA bill that Obama signed into law allows for the indefinite imprisonment of U.S. citizens, or as Obama calls it “prolonged detention.” Prolonged detention allows for the detention of an individual without a charge or trial. - They don't need a warrant, they don't need to read you your rights, they don't need just cause, you don't have the right to an attorney, you don't get to make one phone call. - All they have to do is 'suspect' an individual, of terrorism.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That could be as easy as getting a suspicious package in the mail. They know what it really is, but hey! They yelled terrorism! That's that, sorry Jack!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as the package not addressed to me? I don't see how that's ever going to happen. I use my real name, real address. I've had the love letter, nothing ever came of it. It was such a shitty photocopy, it looked like someone made it using a 20 year old fax machine!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This current gang in the White House, scares the shit out of me. Here's a guy that was groomed in Chicago politics by Bill Ayers. A terrorist. He blew up buildings. Police stations. (no different from the Boston bombers). These are the bad seeds of the whole 60's radical movement, that weren't content to smoke weed and hang out at Woodstock, no, they wanted to blow shit up. To "Bring it all down man". - These guys, are MY enemy.

     I, in God's great mercy, have never been able to figure out why people always open the door for the police? If we are to take the advice "never talk to the police" seriously, then why, why, why open the freaking door? What are you going to do? Open the door then stand there silently to show the police that you will not be broken? Come on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Let me tell you a little story chil'ren. A long, long time ago, at a University far, far away I was at the center of a computer misuse scandal. By this point I had long since been kicked out of that school but the administration kept calling my cell phone. They would take turns calling my cell phone with campus security, Admin would call, then campus security, then Admin... I refused to answer my phone (more out of spite than being ultra-informed of my rights) and I had a Spanish speaking friend re-record my voice mail so that "Hector the Gardener" was the friendly voice one heard when they dialed my number. Well after about a week of this, I learned from some friendlies at the University that my situation had been referred to the local authorities. Then, they (the local authorities) started calling my cell phone, despite my clever disguise on the voice mail. A former roommate of mine had told me that police had even shown up at his apartment, which was my last known residence on file with the school. My roommate said there were two officers and that they gave the usual "he needs to contact us as soon as possible" and "this is very serious and very urgent" bull crap that they occasionally give.  I'm not even going to pretend, when I found that out I was afraid, to put it mildly. I really thought "This is it Karen, you've done it now. You are definitely going to prison." I became so paranoid that I dismantled every computer I had been using at the time and sent hard drives with friends going home for the summer to different states and cities.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There were times that I felt the urge to call the police, just to try to gather some intel, but I was fooling myself. I thought by calling them I could talk my way out of whatever it was I had done (yeah right). Research, much like the kind one could gather from this forum, is what saved me in that situation. I knew what I had done and I wanted to arm myself with as much personal knowledge as possible about the legal system and the usual procedures involved in investigating my particular crime...and one of the first pieces of info I came across was "Don't talk to the police." I learned that it was not against the law to not open the door for them and I learned it was not against the law not to speak to them (aside from identification). To make an already long story short I resisted that urge to call the police and "see what was up". I shut that phone off, took the sim card out, took the battery out and bought a pre-paid phone which I then began to use exclusively.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nothing ever came of it. I would occasionally have people visit the county court clerk's office to see if I had any warrants for arrest under my name and I would breathe a huge sigh of relief when the answer came back "No". Eventually I stopped checking because I got past my paranoia and I realized that without some kind of direct confession with me, while the district attorney could have pursued charges, the cost involved in pursuing it wouldn't have been worth it, especially since in this backwater neck of the woods, computer crime was not a high priority for the DA....
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lesson of the story: Don't talk to the cops. Don't answer the door for the cops. Don't answer the phone for the cops. Don't visit a police station if you suspect you're the subject of a criminal investigation. Hell, I wouldn't visit a court if I suspected I was under investigation, but that's just me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A final question I have....what do you guys do for a living that you all seem to be home to answer the door during the day when these clowns arrive to interrogate you??

    I have to tell you that "Really?" is most annoying. It's grammatically incorrect to begin with, but I'm no grammar fascist. It just sounds so childlike. I've been going to great lengths to get that "question mark at the end of every sentence" garbage, out of my kids speech patterns.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ex. "So I went to the mall yesterday? And I was walking around a lot? And there were lots of people there? And I got an anxiety attack? And I was really dizzy?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you catch my drift.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for letting me get that of my chest!  ;) (Really!)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wait! Maybe you're really Seth Meyers! What do I know? :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, to the point of my stating W was a Socialist. He certainly was more to the left than any other Republican president before him. Though your leftist indoctrinators at University probably wouldn't allow that, it's true. Many pundits have agreed on this, even the Wall St Journal editor!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    W pushed the United States further down the road of economic socialism than any previous president, including Bill Clinton. In the 1996 Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton won the economic debate by painting Republicans as callous scrooges who want to rob the poor and elderly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    His ploy worked and he convinced the average American that Democrats were more compassionate. In framing the debate this way, Clinton crushed the Conservatives under foot. Ever since that time debates on economic policies have taken a decided turn to the left. The ideas of true economic conservatism do not stand a chance in the current political climate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In order to prevent a repeat of the accusations of the past, George Bush strategically moved far to the left, adopting liberal economic policies as his own. The left turn was necessary to stop Republicans from becoming easy targets for the Democrat's slogan machines. George Bush learned well: if you want to win elections, don't debate real issues, use slogans and sound bites.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And above all, don't require the electorate to have to think. It is a recipe for disaster.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How did we get to this from "Help! Police came to door"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh yeah, I insulted our fuhrer, and got the knee jerk reaction built into everyones brain by the media and academia. (a year into Obama's 2nd term, and they're still getting away with it!) ::)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The point I was trying to make, in reference to people and their rights if they're arrested is, that's all changed, and few people know about the National Defense Authorization Act that O signed into law. Unless you search for news outside the mainstream media, you have no idea the treachery this current administration is up to, and has been up to since day one. They are taking away our rights with every day that passes. The US Constitution they see as "an old outdated document". Yet they were able to get to where they are in power, by using that very document. Well that and a lot of race card playing, affirmative action, greasing the skids for this street agitator to glide into power.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well enough politics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's one of the reasons I take drugs. I can't stand to see my country going to shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nice discussion thread though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take care

     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks for letting me get that of my chest!  ;) (Really!)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wait! Maybe you're really Seth Meyers! What do I know? :P
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, to the point of my stating W was a Socialist. He certainly was more to the left than any other Republican president before him. Though your leftist indoctrinators at University probably wouldn't allow that, it's true. Many pundits have agreed on this, even the Wall St Journal editor!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     W pushed the United States further down the road of economic socialism than any previous president, including Bill Clinton. In the 1996 Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton won the economic debate by painting Republicans as callous scrooges who want to rob the poor and elderly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     His ploy worked and he convinced the average American that Democrats were more compassionate. In framing the debate this way, Clinton crushed the Conservatives under foot. Ever since that time debates on economic policies have taken a decided turn to the left. The ideas of true economic conservatism do not stand a chance in the current political climate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In order to prevent a repeat of the accusations of the past, George Bush strategically moved far to the left, adopting liberal economic policies as his own. The left turn was necessary to stop Republicans from becoming easy targets for the Democrat's slogan machines. George Bush learned well: if you want to win elections, don't debate real issues, use slogans and sound bites.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And above all, don't require the electorate to have to think. It is a recipe for disaster.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     How did we get to this from "Help! Police came to door"?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Oh yeah, I insulted our fuhrer, and got the knee jerk reaction built into everyones brain by the media and academia. (a year into Obama's 2nd term, and they're still getting away with it!) ::)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The point I was trying to make, in reference to people and their rights if they're arrested is, that's all changed, and few people know about the National Defense Authorization Act that O signed into law. Unless you search for news outside the mainstream media, you have no idea the treachery this current administration is up to, and has been up to since day one. They are taking away our rights with every day that passes. The US Constitution they see as "an old outdated document". Yet they were able to get to where they are in power, by using that very document. Well that and a lot of race card playing, affirmative action, greasing the skids for this street agitator to glide into power.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Well enough politics.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That's one of the reasons I take drugs. I can't stand to see my country going to shit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nice discussion thread though.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Take care

    Sarcastic retort and grammar lesson aside you make some interesting points.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I see Obama and his wall street cronies no different from any other US administration that has come to office in the last 40 years, the erosion of civil liberties will continue until people wake up and realize their beloved president(s) are little more than puppets doing the bidding of the real power brokers.

    I just saw this thread and thought; "What a bullshit thread/post" - then I realized I was in it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well I guess I made a good point. Those are my thoughts, but I don't remember sharing them here.  :-[
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anytime you see post like these. "Was my address flagged?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Oh no! The letter carrier was different today!" - as an emergency call to arms for help. It's either total bullshit, or some real newb, that everybody with too much time on their hands is giving in to.

    Other than that.

    You don't have a pin hole? Or a window? They surely don't come in by airplane using umbrellas. :|
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I saw another story, but yea, don't even open the door. Be smart about what and where you do things indoors so that when they come to the door they aren't hearing you giggle or smelling the brownies in the oven. Once you open the door, you've now entered into the point where everything you do from picking your nose to opening your mouth to say something stupid, becomes fuel for the fire. It's financially smart for the police to come in... the less reasons they have the better off you are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless of risk now or later, get some education. Talk to a lawyer, get some understanding in search &amp; seizure laws - and the way that LE is getting around it. The worst that can happen is you find out you were doing something stupid and you fix it. You might need to fork over a little money for the time, but it's better than doing time. It may seem like political banter, but following appellate courts regarding questions of the legality towards evidence retained is hardly a waste of time either. We might hate that they do it, but unfortunately our government plays with 20 sided dice daily with our rights.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep things normal - don't give your neighbors reason to say "yea he's suspicious" if they're looking for probable cause. This really goes for everything - the best thing about noise is it all looks the same. The more you fit into the background the noise, the less attention it draws. And never forget, cops have jobs to do, and you may (probably) aren't the only person in the neighborhood that they'd have a field day with. They aren't stupid, social engineering works for things other than hacking.

     Guys, I think I'm fucked. Mostly because I have multiple packages coming to my address and pretty sure the one they came asking about was the first one. I'm sure the second one is also in the mail and I have no way of stopping that. What should I do?

     I followed all the standard procedure...deny deny deny. But since my address is now flagged how I am supposed to explain the next package that comes?
