    2 days from the time it's *actually* shipped. a lot of yahoos on here will mark stuff in transit and sit on it for a day or more, or mail things after the post office closes, delaying it another day, or more if said day is a saturday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    mail is moved and sorted 7 days a week, just not accepted or delivered on sunday.

    Lets just say from Cal to Volunteer Country which is north southeast, I guess.  Short, only happened a couple times: two days.  Longest: 5 or 6 days, only maybe once or twice.  Average: three to four days, 80 percent of the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me ad that I am slightly less than 100 miles from a major airport.
