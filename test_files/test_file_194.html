    Just a quick reason why I don't use express mail.........My dad has been working for USPS for 29 years, first 22 years processing mail, the remaining years working the express room. I won't let a vendor send me anything express mail. Express gets a lot more hands on and personal when its being processed. My father use to come home and tell me about the drug packs that have been coming through and how he has to work with the postal inspectors on numerous occasions. He said sometimes they slowly build cases by letting some packs go through but still documenting everything that's inside. All the time re-sealing the pack back up and you would never know it was ever opened in the first place. Once they feel they have a big enough case, here comes the controlled delivery.....Just some insight from what I learned by my dads stories. I thought it would be good to share with others so you can make your own decisions on how you get your mail sent.

    I mean, if you are a normal citizen who receives Express Mail from time-to-time that is all packaged professionally you have nothing to worry about. Express Mail does have the most individual workers involved and has more hands-on time than any other USPS service. That is true, it is the most riskiest shipping method because of this, that is true. But we are talking about relative risk. An Express Mail package here and there (that doesn't hit other red flags) will never even make a postal worker think twice. It is when a weird pattern emerges that makes them think twice. Or a poorly packaged parcel from an odd location triggers a postal workers suspicions.

    Don't use Express Mail regularly. Only use it when buying from a trusted vendor.
