    I'm thinking about getting my own P.O. box so that i am able to ship my orders there instead of the P.O. Box i currently share with my parents, and was just wondering one thing...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What size P.O. box should i get? ( options available here      http://about.usps.com/forms/ps1093.pdf )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would like a p o box where the packages would fit directly inside of, so that i do not have to go to the counter to receive my package. That's the main question i have, the others the hardworking folks at the Post Office can answer for me : )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you use a p.o. box, what size do you use?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Happy Holidays everyone  :)

    ^ What he said. If you're just getting like a quarter of bud or a few pills off SR, then get the smallest one....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're 100% confident in your vendor's packaging, then get the smallest one cause it won't be an issue for you to sign for it then right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say go big if the money isn't gonna sting ya.

    The most i would ever think of receiving at this office would be 2 oz of weed if that helps, off the SR, and also shopping online ( ebay, amazon, etc.) and having the packages sent to my new P.O. box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was thinking box 2 or box 3
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, when i would order off of here i would be sure to use priority mail, that requires no signature. If i go to the desk to receive an oz of weed shipped priority mail would i need to sign for it? no right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Appreciate all the help guys

    300 is the normal price for an oz in the area that i reside in. However, i have found oz's for as cheap as 210$ (including shipping and fees to get BC on account)

    Thus vendor has oz for 195.00 ( not including the shipping cost ), has great reviews, always throws in a little bit extra too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I actually have an order processing for an oz of cotton candy kush atm : D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I went with this vendor because of the reviews and the price at the time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, going to the street is very risky; People are very greedy around my area, only care about themselves, and there is no respect among people these days. I mean yeah i can trust a few dealers locally for quantities up to an oz, but any more than that i would be cautious about buying from them
