    hello iim very new to the site and starting to begin in the prescription drug trafficking. I definitely do not wish to jeopardize the site with lazy shipping and selling techniques. Wondering if some veterans on the site would come yo my assistance on important tips, goals and routines to do to make sure every delivery is safe for me and the website. Anything can help i really would just like advice on any security and shipping techniques. The dos and dont's.

    I'm new myself, but I have noticed shipping methods are not discussed in detail on SR and the forums. Perhaps you could place a couple of small orders and get an idea of different methods? I've had 5 different orders with just as many different techniques, some so-so... a couple were very clever. Best of luck.

    The first page of this thread has EPIC information. Don't be a fuckhead and try to cut corners, you'll just put your (and, more importantly, others') safety at risk. If you're going to do it, do it right. Here:
