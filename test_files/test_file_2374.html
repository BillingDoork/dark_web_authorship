    That's super interesting!  There were a LOT of people asking super dumb questions or making comments that didn't really further the topic... :/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suppose you should expect that though when you open the floor for anyone to ask questions..  I've actually been wondering myself if you could ship live animals through the mail and what kind of lengths a person would have to go through to accomplish that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wonder what other kind of animals you can send other than bees or ants?

    Those guys are called super nerds. They usually ruin everything.

    <br/>
    Bees, Ants, Frogs, Snakes, turtles, Most reptiles or amphibians really.

    Google "buy a tarantula online"
