    I know there's an insane amount of info on here for newbs and those seeking the right answer. So if anyone has a good link that'd be great too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regarding the use of Fedex or UPS for US deliveries when USPS will not deliver to your home address:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a location I want a friend (non SR related) to deliver to using UPS or Fedex as the USPS will not deliver to the address I'm trying for. USPS will only hold it at the po and the address recipient does not want to go to the PO and pick it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How tough or difficult is it to ship anon using one of the two?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does ups require ID for retail store shippings?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do most people here think it's just best to send using usps anyway and write on box "hold at PO"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are there any vendors in US that do in fact use UPS or Fedex that anyone here knows about?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for any suggestions

    USPS can't open the mail without a warrant.  FEDEX and UPS can open any package they want.  Unless you're a pro don't use FEDEX or UPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're talking about sending something like weed then you need to make sure it is in a scent-proof bag such as a moisture barrier bag (MBB).  Lots of stinky weed packages get caught, even my USPS which can get a warrant if the package alerts a drug dog.

    What kind of address in the US won't USPS deliver too? Is it possibly so remote that they just don't send a mail carrier out there?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess this may not be a question you don't want to answer as to not give away too much info, but I'm just genuinely curious. I figured all of the US was covered by USPS.

    That is a common misconception.  I also usually don't ever correct people when I see it on here but I have the urge to correct it this time.  USPS can't open FIRST CLASS mail without a warrant.  They CAN open express and priority mail without a warrant.

    From my knowledge that can open express without a warrant, priority and first class they require a warrant.  But really guys, I bet they open and reseal packages without warrants on a daily basis.

    Well, I believe most of us saw the post carrier thread where him or someone mentioned their dad worked in the express department and would covertly open, check, and close up packages on the reg.... right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also had heard that all FC, priority and express are considered first class. Not sure about that but I believe I'd heard it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And yes, the address/area I'm talking about does NOT receive usps delivery. They do receive fedex and ups. I recall a package went there through ups but got sent as a usps delivery and got held up at the PO. The addressee went and picked it up at the post office. So it's just outside of their delivery area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally think picking up a held package at the po is no problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I've also heard of plenty of thefts from UPS and FEDEX and I think that issue in particular is related to savvy bitch ups and fedex store employees who have learned to spot weed shippers. And the more I think about it, the less I want to recommend using the other two.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But sometimes there just isn't a feasible address to use for usps.
    <br/>

    Well, that's a pretty good reference.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My research was reading court documents and such.  Your reference says that other classes of mail don't contain personal correspondence which is rubbish.  Anyway, I'll report back when I find some references for what I found.  Thanks.

       That is a common misconception.  I also usually don't ever correct people when I see it on here but I have the urge to correct it this time.  USPS can't open FIRST CLASS mail without a warrant.  They CAN open express and priority mail without a warrant.

     Why argue with me when I am clearly correct?  Asking your stoner buddy or the bartender at your local pub will not yield you an accurate answer.  That is bad research my friend.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I will quote a government site for reference to my correct answer.  On all of my other usernames and vendor accounts I never correct anyone.  One day I just got so tired of seeing hundreds of posts of bullshit information and I started posting from this account.  I usually ignore incorrect information but in this case you argued with me so I will provide proof that I am right and you sir are pulling incorrect information out of your asshole.

    , but if you're inaccurate (as I believe), I don't want people having misinformation and shipping 1st class with a stamp when they could have sent priority with the same protections.

    Forgive my source, when I received a sketchy package I found this better sourced on the intrawebz, just don't have time to scour for it now.

    From my, typically correct, understanding; Priority and Priority Express are regarded as First Class Mail, therefore cannot be opened *legally* (mind if we search the vehicle? lolz) without a warrant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not saying you are wrong, just saying it's my opinion that I'm right. Plus my Yahoo answers source is a "24 year old postal worker," seems legit, I believe him!

    Ask the postal worker by the username pstlwrkr or whatever his name was.  He even mentioned that express can be opened.  First class is not the same as priority and express.  First class is what you are supposed to use for sensitive documents and records which is why it is protected.  I have to leave for several hours.  I will ask the postal worker after I catch up on business when I return.  Me and him converse privately on a weekly basis.  He's a nice guy.

    Like I said, I'm not stating you're wrong. Besides the fact pstlwrkr is an interactive source, I'd attribute the same credibility to him as the fella on Yahoo Answers claiming otherwise. I'm fuzzy about Express, but I'm almost 100% that Priority is in the same boat as First Class with respect to warrants to open. After receiving a package with a slit on the side I spent quite a while looking into it and that was the result of my endeavors.

    Post Office May Hold Express Mail to Obtain Search Warrant—Court
    <br/>

    The Postal Service did not violate the Fourth Amendment when it held an express mail package for six days before obtaining a warrant to search it for drugs, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled yesterday.

    The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit decided the issue of whether a postal inspector violated a defendant's Fourth Amendment constitutional rights by seizing a package from a mail cart that contained methamphetamine.

    In this case, U.S. Postal Inspector Kevin Marshall, a law enforcement officer, was conducting a routine examination of Express Mail packages
