     Stamped priority mail no longer able to be dropped in blue box?

    So my friend was at the post office this afternoon to purchase some flat rate priority stamps and was told something rather odd by a manager there. He said that all STAMPED priority mail and any stamped parcels that aren't standard sized letters are no longer allowed to be dropped in the box, and must be handed to a clerk to "stamp it" -- otherwise, the packages will be returned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The exact thing the dude said was "you know you'll have to drop off your packages to me from now on".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Upon further inquiry, he stated that he couldn't say when it would start, but he "assumed it was starting today". After being reminded of the &gt;13oz rule that has been in effect, he acknowledged knowing about that and stated that they were changing that rule to apply to "all stamped packages". He said "We had a meeting about it today. The administration has been here all day and they have been and are still going through packages right now." He said that he asked about whether there was a new weight limit (like 8 ounces instead of 13 or something) and "the administration" couldn't give him any answers on it. He said that when he asked when it goes into effect, he didn't get any straight answers on that either, but he "assumes it's today, because they are already going through packages to send them back".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One other interesting thing he said was, "I guess they're just picking and choosing what goes through, then". Wtf??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anybody heard anything about this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any info would be greatly appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    EDIT:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Something I just remembered... My friend thought it was odd that he would be saying all this to somebody buying stamps and just recalled that the guy also mentioned that he was telling everybody that was buying flat rate stamps today because he thought it was "unfair" that they would be returning ppl's packages without any kind of advanced warning, so he wanted to let people know that they had to be taken to a clerk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The whole thing seems really strange.

    I doubt it, if they were going to make a change like that they would have to anounce the change pubicly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The price of mail is going up on jan 27th, the postal worker was probably confused

    Yeah I would think so too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The whole thing seems sketchy as fuck to me. It really was my friend and not me that was in there talking to this dude, but I promise you it happened just like that, lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But why would the guy make up a whole line of shit about a meeting and asking questions re: weight, etc?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perhaps dopeymean's postal guy is off his meds or took the brown acid. I dunno.
