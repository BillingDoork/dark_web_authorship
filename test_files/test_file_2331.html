    buyer Larghetto(97) stated I as protected by a reship guarantee and requested that I finalize early. however,Â  the finalize link is missing in the orders page and I don't know what to make of the reship guarantee.: Please, advise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The message text is below.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;Thank you very much for your order. However, we kindly ask, which is not uncommon for sellers to ask new buyers to do, since you don't have a large amount of successful transactions, and are fairly new to this site, that you finalize early.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;You are protected by a reship guarantee, which covers the entire world including Australia and New Zealand. We will cover you in the event for completely free should customs seize your product. So, you are quite well protected regardless, and we will honor this contract no matter what status you have as a buyer, or what country you are in, or what product or size you ordered as long as it states that it qualifies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;We stress that it is not uncommon for sellers in good standing to ask new buyers to do. If you are happy to do so, we will make it so you are able, and have your package mailed out as soon as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;Do you want any free samples? Any of our benzodiazepine (e.g Bromazepam, Valium, Xanax, Mogadon, Restoril, Dormicum etc.), G. Subutex, Modafinil, G. Adderall, Pure Codeine, Tramadol, Novartis or Generic Ritalin, Soma, Generic Xenical, Phentermine and now Xolnox too, we can put a few tablets of any of these items along with your order in your package so you can try them out before your next purchase. Please message us back, and we will put it in your order :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt;Thanking you again for your order, and your understanding in this matter,
    <br/>
    &gt;Larghetto

    The finalize option doesn't become available until the order is placed in transit, i.e. shipped. So, i'd say the vendor is waiting for you to confirm that you will finalize early before placing the order in transit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you accept those terms, write back to the vendor and you will then be able to finalize the order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck
