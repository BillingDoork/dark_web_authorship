    Hi,
    <br/>
    since I registered to SR I focused on reading and learning how to use the service, possibly safer than possible.
    <br/>
    Seems to me that the common opinion is to ship to some close friend's and then quietly bring where you will use what you ordered.
    <br/>
    Is it so safe?
    <br/>
    If LE ever notices your parcels, they'll easily trace your activities, seeing that you go to your friend's and see where you live. For the little I know about LE here in EU, they don't always prosecute any infringement but what they like more is track your activities and see if they can get to catch some big fish in the process, other than you..
    <br/>
    Also, if I ask to use a friend's mail box, I can decide wether to ask to a drug using friend or to a "sober" friend. In the last case I risk to expose my habit, and I don't like it for many reasons. In the first I'll probably receive a "no thanks" as an answer since the friend risks to expose himself, having drugs in the house himself.
    <br/>
    If anyone wants to share some knowledge with me, please PM me or post here!

    A drop house of a friend who doesnt use drugs is usually best. Its all about their deniability and what the police can prove. although they can track your movements and who you associate with if they cant prove you bought the drugs, the btcs etc then the deniability is good for all parties involved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The main worry is controlled deliverys, if you are dealing with domestic orders especially next day deliveries then the chances are low. Ideally you mix up the drop houses and offer friends money to take a day of work to collect the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Deny deny deny, just work out how you may answer questions from LE in a worst case scenario situation. Covering all tracks etc.. from text messaging to btc purchasing.
