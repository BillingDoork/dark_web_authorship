    Hello,
    <br/>
    in Germany it is possible, to register at Package Service. You once get an ID and a card, since then you're able to get your package delivered to a package station nearby your flat/house. You'll get a SMS/Mail as it reaches the station.
    <br/>
    So what do you thing, about this idea. You don't give your address free, that's a good point IMO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going to maker my first order soon. ..So the packets are they really safe - user variable I guess?, like smelling or something.. that they maybe could get leery off it?
    <br/>

    Find a reputable vendor with good ratings. As long as they vacuum seal and ship stealthily, you should be fine. I see no problems with what you've suggested doing, although a home address would work just as well.

    I guess you're talking about DHL Packstationen, in which case you need to make sure the seller ships via DHL, which could be a problem especially with international orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't bother giving my real address to a reputable seller. The bigger problem may be customs/LE intercepting your package, for which reason I for myself would choose the address with a better chance for deniability. (Don't know about the level of decrease of deniability for Packstation addresses though)
