    Hello all. I am new to the community and was tracking an order from a good vendor today and saw that it had tried to be delivered in an entirely different city, status then went to undeliverable as addressed and then to forward. I contacted the vendor for the address he had sent it to and the address was perfectly correct except that the zip code was off by one digit. Like it started with 86 and should have been 85, just as an example. Any advice on what to do now? Will it still get to me? It figures I wanted to do a trial run with this new vendor in the hopes of doing continuous business and I screw up the first transaction. Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer.

    I have always got my letter with the zip being wrong (small amount of times) but it could just be that the post office being dicks because it is from out of country.Â  I wouldn't hold my breath for the shipment but there is still a chance.

    100% you will get it, just might take forever since it needs to be manually sorted. I believe now they have a special sort station and when things like this happen a scan of the package is sent to them and they fix it since its all routed by barcode they just need to change the info associated with the barcode to the correct address. you will get it but it may take say another week. you could have googled this or called post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are very lucky the post office it was sent to will have caught the mistake and sent it to the right place in which case could be delivered as soon as tomorrow.

    Thanks for the comments everyone. I will keep my fingers crossed. I may even get the balls to call and say what's up the zip is only different by one and it's express, guaranteed.

    If the wrong zip code is valid probably sent to this location first. The address is wrong and try to solve it. I hope that your shipment was packaged well, they got special attention now.

    Everything worked out. I had to actually go to the local post office to pick it up in person because of the address error and that had me a little scared but it worked out ok. Thanks everyone for your comments.

    I know this sounds like the worst luck. Didn't want to start a new thread but I already have another shipping issue with a vendor. This time thee street address is off by 1 digit. Like the street address should start with 32 but is addressed to start with 31 instead and as far as I know there are no addresses on this street that start with 31. It is express mail Ca to US. Anyone have any ideas on how this one will go and what to do. Thanks in advance.

    It sounds like you can't correctly type your own address.

    If there is no "31" (i hope this was only an example) there but you've used a name you have used before, I'm sure the postal worker will realize it's meant for you. It's easy to make typographical errors in addresses.
    <br/>

    A little easier for some than others, it seems...

    Sorry, forgot to close this out. Everything worked out in the end and i received the package. This was part of the Fanny Hill fiasco if you are interested you can read her review page. Lesson learned though to be very careful about addressing and even if it is screwed up by either side you can still do something to ensure you receive it. Thanks to all that commented.
