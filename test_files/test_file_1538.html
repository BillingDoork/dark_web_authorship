    So I made an order 13 days ago and my letter hasn't arrived. Normally, it would take 7-12 days from Europe for my location and this letter is coming from South Africa. I also made an order a day after from a part of Europe that should take around 9 days but was put on transit early since it was mailed on a Saturday...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The previous month I had made 5 international orders and they all came in fine, and I'm a little worried that maybe the postal services in my country are suspicious that one house is getting quite a spree of international letters.
    <br/>
    I should just calm down and try to be patient huh? I'm getting antsy since it either comes tomorrow on Friday, or I've got another weekend to bear with and have to hope on Monday...
    <br/>

    Whats the latest you guys have waited for your letter/package?

    Be patient.  After 21 days, then I would begin to wonder.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The way international registered mail works in most places is they fill up crates of mail going to the destination country.  Until the crate is full, it doesn't get sent.  So sometimes you'll get lucky and land at the top of the heap and sometimes not so lucky and there won't be a lot of mail for whatever reason.  That is why it varies so much internationally iirc.

    Ahhh I see! I honestly did not know that! I always wondered how and when they send international mail, I mean I know most of the procedures and sorting but didn't actually think about how often they send out mail. I guess I was mostly lucky the previous times, and also my vendor sent the mail on a friday, who knows, it might have been only sent on monday or something because of this.

    Thank you so much, really bluedev1! +1 :)
