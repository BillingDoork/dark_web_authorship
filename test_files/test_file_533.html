    Hey guys have a situation which i dont know what to do.
    <br/>
    I ordered a large amount off a fairly new Silk Road vendor.  I had spoken to the vendor back and forth before ordering we agreed  on tracking for the package being an over seas order and peace of mind for both of us.
    <br/>
    Once i ordered the order was sitting in processing for a few days with no contact from the vendor.  Around 4 days later i finally heard from them saying it had been shipped via DHL, they also stated that they would not be giving me the tracking details as when tracking it, it showed up their personal details as well due to the way they had to ship it ( i find this ridiculous because later he claimed customs had it and im sure they would do much more with his personal details than me).
    <br/>
    While waiting for the package to arrive the vendor gave me shipping updates via messages but still would not give me any tracking details, after a week and a half they told me it had been seized and wouldnt state how he knew, I finally had enough of waiting so i called DHL and stated the delivery address and name which they told me there was no record on their system of anything lodged to the name or address.
    <br/>
    When i told the vendor i had contacted DHL and  gave them the response that nothing was lodged they claimed this was not possible and if it was the case we had contacted DHL police would have been knocking at my door (funny because they claimed their personal details were on it as well)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After messages back and forth through resolution they offereed me a full re ship and 50% refund this was strange, then out of no where they tell me they have re-shipped to the same address that the last package was apparently seized to.  I never asked for a re-ship and if i did it would have been to a different address.
    <br/>
    With this new package they gave me tracking details and all seemed like it was coming through until i logged in and tracking had said "package delivered"  :-\
    <br/>
    I contacted the post to get further details and it had been delivered to a completely different state.
    <br/>
    So my conclusions are:
    <br/>
    A: The first package was never sent
    <br/>
    B: The second one which i was given tracking for was probably someone elses package
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my issues are their tracking says delivered, i cant think of a way to prove to the SR team where i live, can anyone think of a way i can prove that i was scammed? The vendors feedback has plunged from 100% to 76%, he's removed all his listing and hasn't been seen in 3 days so its even more clear he is a scammer.

    Hey bobyouruncle,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This definitely sounds like a scam. The only thing I can think off is contact the admins and just tell them exactly what happened, maybe send a copy of all correspondents between you and the vendor to them and see what happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully the admins see it in your favor. Especially if they have already been contacted by a few other members who may have been scammed by this guy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck with it all mate!

    It for sure sounds like someone is fucking you around.. If the ytack they gave u says delivered then it was someone eles track #.. Iv never had any tracking from anywhere ever say some ones personal Info on it, Far as i know thats Bullshit.. Iv had things from China, Inida, pAKISTAN, AUS, Netherlands,Poland And not all this has been drug related . The Vendor seems FOS.. If you dont live in the state it was deliverd to then thats enough alone to help you, All though u cant prove your not in that state, lol.. So did they giving you the 50% back also? And are u saying as soon as they gave u the track # and u logged in it said delivered?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go to their feedback and give them a 1/5 and tell in the feeback they bullshitted u around.. U need to Post who the Vendor is also, so no one else has this issue.. There is a section In 'rumor mill' Or one of the forums and at the top it says 'Scamms' in red highlight, bUT post the Vendors name here also..

    Are you still in escrow? If so then simply ask for a 100% refund and explain why. If all you state is true then I don't doubt you will get your money back.

    I think with his stats and recently bad feed back popping up (just today) its clear to me i shouldn't have a problem with Escrow the wholle amount is still sitting there, after i ordered his policies for Aus and NZ changed to FE, which luckily i didnt, i kept refusing to FE any amount until i had the package which i ensured he would know cause it was tracked, because as i said earlier when i contacted DHL about the first package they said there was no record, that alone raised my first suspicions.
    <br/>
    I tracked it leaving UK, arriving through customs and being sent to a delivery center only to see it delivered to someone else :(
    <br/>
    The Vendor is UK Mandy Man and have been posting in the rumor mill for a few days regarding him and some of his feed back, seems i wasn't the only person who was suss on him.
    <br/>
    Silk Road admin have our whole conversation back and forth from the first package and me stating everything i have written in here, like i said only problem is with his tracking saying delivered and i cant prove it wasnt sent to me, the only other thing in my favour is he hasn't been on in 3 days, all listings removed and bad feedback is popping up.  One was someone ordered 250g of mdma and they only got .5g! There were a few other feedback that said similar things.

    Request 100% refund in the resolution center. The admins would probably already be aware of him and may grant your refund without you having to prove anything further.

    I placed a 100g order with him, he then requested me to FE because I was in AU. My stats are 5 figures BTW. I basically told him to get fucked and why doesn't he say that on his page, at which point he updated it stating so and I posted in the forums warning others about him. He claims to be some poor student but is shipping 100's of grams of Molly.... That's doesn't add up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He's trying to do you mate, don't take a step back. If you're buyer history and feedback are top notch the admins will likely side with you since he's a new suspiciously acting vendor, rapidly receiving negative feedback. Just make sure to let them know in resolution everything you can find out about his shifty behavior and similar XP from others.

    Thanks all for your help and responses.  Hopefully it works in my favour, its sad to see that there still are scammers out there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thisisnotashillaccount.. luckily you didnt order through him, i saw your post in the rumor mill a few days ago when i was waiting for the second order.  I think a lot had to do with location as well.  Prob didnt have any clue how to stealth ship over seas.

    Coming from the UK. It's not hard at all, I've had some of the most suspect letters come out of there and if he's a Uni student you would expect him to have enough intelligence to realize what he's doing, the gambles and risks people are taking and put the appropriate amount of research and effort into good packaging.

    I learned a long time ago never to FE for any vendor ANY vendor. If you have stats and they ask you to. Scam. Although I did recently for someone I wont mention for reasons that most people  end up getting scammed for... but it's required of everyone and he still maintains a 100 rating. Although my order has not arrived in a month. :(

    You're right thanks for the advice mate, at the end of the day thats what escrow is for, I'm only using highly recommended vendors from now on, good stats and with no FE, i have no reason to scam sellers karma always comes back so my lesson learnt plus my stats are good  ;D
