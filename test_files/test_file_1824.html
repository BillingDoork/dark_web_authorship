    After doing somne research online last night I am a little confused about what the requirements are for being able to drop parcels in the blue mailboxes and other outgoing mail slots (such as at apt complexes and universities).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First is the question concerns type of postage and weight; I was told if it is more than 13 ounces it must be taken in to the post office. If it is under 13 ounces it can be dropped in a blue box but MUST have a printed barcode postage from the USPS website etc. This is contradictory to what I have been told here and at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So can a flat rate priority envelope under 13 ounces with postage stamps only and a simple label for return address/address on it be dropped in the blue mail boxes? What about outgoing mail slots at apartment complexes? Multiple people said that USPS requires a printed barcode postage to be used for the sole purpose of being able to track the shipper and prevent anonymous shipping. Most of these places I read this were forums and threads were somewhat old. Has this changed / is this incorrect?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second question is simple, I am trying to gauge how much weight the avg priority envelope parcel is, so for example how much would a  flat rate priority envelope (regular letter sized) with another bubble cushioned envelope that fits inside it with about 10 regular pieces of paper in it weigh? Would it most likely be less than 13 ounces? (Planning on getting scale soon)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last question; since there are obviously vendors shipping packages that weight more than 13 ounces, how can they be mailed without having to go in to the post office and remaining anonymous (no purchase of trackable, printed barcode postage required)?
    <br/>

    YES. USPS workers LIE! imagine that. I can only speak to blue box drop offs. These will work as long as you are SURE you have the postage right. E.G. - 1 priority stamp, 1 - .20$ stamp and 2 forever (.45$) stamps will allow a small flat rate priority box WITH DCN (UNDER 13oz) to ship via a blue box drop. The PO workers will tell you this is NOT the case. Test it. Mail something this way to yourself or a friend.

    The 13 ounce rule applies to STAMPED mail only.  By the way, thats pretty much the only restriction that applies to drop boxes.  Whoever told you about needing usps.com generated barcodes is talking out of their ass.

    Even if you could find an answer to this questrion( I doubt one even exists) it will be of absolutley no use to you as it pertains to shipping.  None.  If you want to make an anoynous drop keep your pkgs under 13 ounces.  If you need to ship 20 ounces.... split it up between two seperate mailings.

    There is nothing anonymous about stepping into a US Post Office in 2012.  Pretending you are an ebay seller will not make you anonymous.
