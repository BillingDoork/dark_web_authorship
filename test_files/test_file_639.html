    I got my first hit on my refund rate - it now stands at 6%.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I feel so sad. I had perfect stats, then a package was not received. I tried to work out a solution with the vendor other than a refund, and I proposed tracked postage, but the vendor said he cannot send tracked mail, so I was forced to accept a 50% refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Speaking of that - what do you think should be my feedback rating for this vendor? You know the details. What rating should I give this vendor in my feedback?

    That sucks about your buyer stats taking a hit. Not the end of the World though and life will go on regardless! :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regarding the rating, I would always take into consideration the service I got from the vendor as a whole. If they stayed in good contact, were friendly, apologetic etc, I would still leave a good rating. They work hard for their rating and we are dealing with illegal goods for the most part. Hence, I can understand why they wouldn't offer a re-ship with tracked shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other hand, if they were rude, obnoxious or just sloppy with the transaction, I would leave a low rating. Just my 2 cents, but it is up to you what feedback score you leave ;)

    You should take all things into account and give them an honest score based on your truthful opinion of events. As long as you're honest and base your score solely on the facts alone, you can't go wrong. Trust your gut feeling on matters such as these. :) :)

    Thanks, both of you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess I am pretty disappointed right now, and I will give it a couple of weeks before I leave any feedback.
