    The last two packages that my friends received had a blue "?" on the front of the envelope. Is this something that I should be concerned about? They were both from the same vendor and came as a commercial envelope(junk mail looking). The mark was written with a blue ink pen like someone maybe questioning the package?? Postman, Mail Inspector,?? Any insight would be great.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Carrier: USPS
    <br/>
    Package Size: Standard Junk Mail Envelope
    <br/>
    Both Packages to same Name about a month apart or so but this may be the only mail that arrives in this name(real name)

    They often do that if the name on the package isn't the name of the person at the address.

    It's probably for sorting reasons and the above post is correct, usually if the name does not match the address database they will do this,  no matter though, in my experience even if the address does not match the database they will deliver it anyway, but that's just my experience with postal workers.  The ones I've had to deal with don't care who's name is on the package.

    if it is one of those delivery confirmations and it isn't a listed name for the address you will get the '?'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I believe non-delivery confirmations will never get the '?'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    try it with something legal and use DC shipping with an ex-gf name to test it out

    I have gotten that, a question mark, or other various markings a lot, on all sorts of letters, packages etc when I lived at an apartment and would get old renters mail....Then one day I asked my mail man when I so happened to be out side and he said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Oh yea I do that to indicate that we are unsure if this person is a resident, If you could write no longer lives here, return to sender, and stick it back in the mail box it will go back out an we will stop delivering this persons mail to your apartment/home etc"

    I've noticed a few deliveries lately where that blue pen has punctured the outside layer of the package. What's up with that?
