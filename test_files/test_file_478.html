    That is unusual isnt it? I just got a package that I ordered thursday. My dog started barking and I went to the window to look and it was a USPS vehicle. Is it because of the Christmas holiday?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Got me kind of noid. I have looked all around my house, there are no unusual vehicles and the package remains outside on the porch where  they left it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else get Priority Mail packages on sunday?

    This sounds really sketch.  I have never received mail on a Sunday, from SR or anyone else.  Was it a large order?  If I were you, I would try and stay calm, not keep peering out the windows like a guilty tweaker, and wait a day or two.

    Priority mail should not run on Sunday.  By any chance did your vendor ship it express and pay the extra fee to have it delivered on Sunday?

    Yeah, me neither and I order tons of stuff(mostly legal). From what I can see the package does not look to be tampered with and it matches what I have come to expect from this vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its not a huge package but enough I guess.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Took my dog for a walk down the street and didnt see anything out of the ordinary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I leave it outside or bring it in and mark it "Return to Sender"?

    I have heard of mail services delivering on weekends for the holidays which could explain this.. but still be cautious but know this is not unheard of during christmas when they are rushing to deliver people's gifts

    Everything is still fine right now. I moved the package inside and wrote return to sender on it, I dont want to leave it outside because there are a few big dogs that wander my neighborhood.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There was no attempt to get me to sign anything, they didnt even knock just left the package at my door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll give it until tomorrow at least.

    I saw post office trucks driving around when I was out this morning. Also had a package delivered on Christmas day once but it was a few years ago tho. It doesn't surprise me they are working today if for no other reason than to lighten the load for tomorrow which is going to be a bitch for USPS plus, post offices close at noon tomorrow.  Happy holidays!

    Ehh, to be swamped they got my package to me just as fast as ever, considering the sunday delivery. It was shipped friday arrived sunday, coast to coast.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways I'm starting to relax just a bit.

    I believe I read somewhere today while googling mail related inquiries, that during the Christmas time even if its sunday the usps still delivers mail... but it only applies to Xmas time.  Don't quote me on it though lol
