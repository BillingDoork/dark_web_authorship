    If you're ordering legal stuff and it's being shipped to you, can you please keep us updated in regards to your packages being opened and searched? If there's a noticeable rise in customs checking SR users' mail, then that would be a fairly good indication that addresses sent through SR were not destroyed and were in fact stored and are now being used by LE.

    I just received my very first SR order today with no problem. It took FOREVER to get here, was starting to think I wouldn't get it. It was marked in transit early on 9/21 or 9/22 but was postmarked 9/30 and just FINALLY got here. It was just some blotter 25i, I think that's legal so I wasn't too worried about it. I always used PGP encryption.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have 4 other orders in the mail, 2 of which I'm pretty nervous about. Those are going to a drop address. Will update when I receive them and let you guys know what happens.

    Where I come from, it's very clear when customs inspect your package - they leave a little note inside saying it's been checked and give you the all-clear. So if you do order a lot of (legal) stuff from overseas and get it through the mail, and you suddenly start to notice more packages being checked by customs, let us know.

    I was fairly new to SR. Only had total of 6 orders. Most of those transaction went well, but 2 of them were cancelled by the vendors after being marked "processing" for a couple days. One of those I had exchanged PM's with before placing the order and was told no problem, go ahead and order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Didn't think too much about it at the time, figured I was a newbie and maybe they just didn't feel comfortable doing business with me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But with recent events, I've begun wondering how many vendors on SR may actually have been LE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seems it would be easy for them to set up fake vendor accounts, fake buyers as well to provide legitimate looking feedback on their vendor page, on the forum also.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They could harvest loads of prospective buyers addresses, encrypted or not, put them on a list for further investigation. or charge them with attempting to purchase, whatever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else had a similar experience, with multiple orders being cancelled by vendors?
