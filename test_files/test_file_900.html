    I'm a relatively old-timer here on the road (been here since summer of 2011) but recently I have had two rather disconcerting orders. Both were for about an oz of mdma (one from canada to US and the other from US to US express), both have the DCN showing successful delivery, and in both cases there is no trace of the actual package or a slip from the PO or anything. It'd be one thing if both packages didn't arrive to the same drop house (at which point I would obviously burn the address), but I had them sent to different drop houses with different names in different zip codes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've already finalized the order from Canada since DCN said delivered which basically tied my hands, and I suppose I'll be finalizing the other order too either some time tonight or tomorrow morning. 2oz of mdma isn't bank-breaking, but it isn't exactly chump change either. I'm not even really sure what I'm asking here, but I suppose if anyone has any thoughts or theories as to why the packages are MIA despite being recorded as delivered I would greatly appreciate it!

    Anyone? No thoughts? This has never happened before and I simply can't fathom why it would happen twice in the same week. I have another package coming tomorrow or monday and if that one also goes missing then I'm just going to prep for prison since I don't believe in magic package stealing elves.

    I feel for you man, and wish you the best. I guess the only other explanation, and I guess the best?, at this point is that they were stolen. how is that possible? Who fucking knows.

    I would stake out the place and see if the package actually gets delivered and wait to see if there's someone taking it....and doesn't look like LE, grab that fool and interrogate him.. I would get there 3hrs before the mail man/woman tends to get there..In case it is LE...bring someone big and intimidating..lol It's the only chance really to figure out what happen...

    Hmmm. This is very interesting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a priority pack go MIA recently.
    <br/>
    It ended up just taking a few more days, which was pretty weird for a priority package but in the end it came through no problem!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really hope they both show up with no problems for you, as well.
    <br/>
    Obviously try to get in touch with the vendor, if you haven't already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise just clean house and try to forget about it.
    <br/>
    Keep us updated, too!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck.

    I recently had a cannabis package split and shipped to two different locations
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one of them came no problems, but this second one is still MIA and it's been 7 days, very unusual for a priority pack, but still staying hopeful for a monday delivery
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully I will find out today from the vendor what the status is from the tracking. I hope your shipments arrive safely as I hope mine do :)

    Just wanted to update all on my status. Both packages (for which I have finalized since DCN &gt; customer's word) of ~1oz mdma are still MIA and not being held at the post office. On the plus side, my third package, the one for a pound of weed DID show up to one of the two drop houses that lost the mdma. While I'm very glad to have gotten my final package, it does just make the other two missing packages all the more confusing.

    I had ordered a gram of Methylone and the vendor confirmed the DCN said delivered, well it's been OVER a month and nothing has come. There are more and more cases of this exact thing happening and it's making me suspicious of LE's new plan. I had this happen then in the next few days, began seeing many other cases of the same thing come out of nowhere. The mailman hasn't said anything, neighbors haven't asked about anything being sent to a wrong address, it's some weird shit going on. The weirdest part is that I haven't been questioned, or anything like that at all. It's a mystery how this stuff's been going on.

    It sounds very likely that the packages were intentionally taken because they contained MDMA.  Extremely unlikely for two packages to coincidentally vanish otherwise.  So, it was either LEO or a postal worker.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd imagine there's quite a few postal workers who are always keeping an eye out packages that look like drugs - and to take them, not call the cops!  Who knows, there could even be postal workers lurking on SR to try to get info on profiling packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did you have tracking or just delivery confirmation?  Tracking info would be helpful, just to see how far it got.  If this was a drop house, is it possible the deliveryman knew that it was a bogus name for that address?  Also, if package was left by the door it could have been stolen by anyone.
