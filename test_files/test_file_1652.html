    Iv been reading through alot of feedback and it seems like were going through another rough patch. Either they have found new methods to catch packages ( including ones that are using MBB) or we have all been super unlucky!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im still waiting on 4 packages to 2 different drops, both from the UK that are going on 17-20 days (including weekends). From tried and tested vendors i have used loads of times before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other LEGIT items have made it through that were sent AFTER these ones.. .?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv heard some new theory's about customs using x-ray's on all letter mail looking for plant matter etc. Therefore they could just pick them out no problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess I'm also hoping that everyone is SAFE and always using drops that cant be traced back to themselves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The whole international thing is starting to give me the shits.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please somebody prove me wrong!!

    They trap in smell and moisture. Sniffer dogs can't smell through them. But, they are foil so they are detectable via x-rays.

    <br/>
    Also, Aus customs isn't that much different to other countries. Their effectiveness has really been blown out of proportion.

    Sorry but where is the anecdotal  evidence that dogs can't sniff through MBBs?  Dogs smell through anything, including concrete.

    There is definitely an improvement in Australian customs, success-rates are down across the board with MBB's. MBB's inside letters from the UK and Europe have a &lt;50% chance of making it through right now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can still get stuff through our customs but you have to use different kinds of stealth. Customs find Silk Road orders everyday now and they know what to look for, they have seen thousands and thousands of MBB's inside letters, it's probably the most common illegal packaging method they find, it's no longer adequate to send drugs this way to Australia.
    <br/>

    The enemy has changed their tactics, we can either change ours too or continue throwing our money down the toilet.

    No good saying this unless you can tell us where the info comes from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They are going to spending lots of time inspecting mail containing computer parts and other commercially packaged goods if this is the case. I have seen and heard this all before numerous times.  Smugglers are getting better and better, customs are trying to play catch up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a numbers game - pure and simple. The chances are they are not going to find most stuff purchased from SR and if we were all honest we'd be saying that instead of pandering to our own paranoia (which is fair enough).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because? The fact is, 90% of us are good citizens who wouldn't be ordering if there was a good chance of getting caught.  They still have to prove you ordered and paid for the item, which is why only a handful of people have been convicted world wide most of whom confessed.

    <br/>
    just like to say that i reicieved two packages today. They were super late so dont worry!! The only strange thing is that the two packages that arrived were the ones that i ordered AFTER the ones that i ordered to the same drop 4 days before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am putting it down to Royal Mail and Aus Post being shit - fucking - house.

    Well go ahead and slag on RM and Auspost - they picked up your packages from somewhere in England, flew them across the world and safely delivered them to a mailbox of your choosing.

    Sounds like a champion effort to me.

    While Customs may be tightening up there operation, the key to your package arriving is the vendor's ability to stealthily disguise and package your items. These types of vendors are hard to find but are out there. I've only had 1 tiny package in well over a year go missing and I'm not sure it was even sent! Vendor's need to lift their game if they want to have success. It can be done but it's fair to say the older methods are no longer safe to use and are out dated. I'm only too happy to pay extra for shipping if I know the vendor will increase their level of stealth.

    What makes you think that something is happening?? What reports are you referring to? Just because some people are not receiving their orders, doesn't mean Customs are doing a blitz on International mail. It's all to do with a vendor's packaging! The materials used, the actual stealth used, the look of the package, the labeling, etc. Sure some packages won't get through Customs for what ever reason but if the vendor is skilled in the art of stealth, chances are your package will arrive, safe and sound. Speaking from personal experience, I've only lost one order and that was well over a year ago now and to be honest, I doubt it was ever sent. I'm happy to be proven wrong but I don't remember any news articles on Customs blitzing International Mail in Australia. Yes they may have improved their detection techniques including new profiling profiles, etc, but if the vendor is good at their job and does it right, there's every chance your order will arrive.  8)

    Totally agree with you mate...I would be happy to pay a substantial amount more if I knew that the vendor would make the extra effort. I just got a order 2 days ago from the UK. It took 6 days including the weekend and when I grabbed it from my drop im like 'Nooo, this cant be it...It looked that good' I messaged them and told them they had just earn t themselves a loyal customer because of their professionalism. If only vendors made that extra effort their business would be booming...

     While Customs may be tightening up there operation, the key to your package arriving is the vendor's ability to stealthily disguise and package your items. These types of vendors are hard to find but are out there. I've only had 1 tiny package in well over a year go missing and I'm not sure it was even sent! Vendor's need to lift their game if they want to have success. It can be done but it's fair to say the older methods are no longer safe to use and are out dated. I'm only too happy to pay extra for shipping if I know the vendor will increase their level of stealth.

    Has anyone thought that both Aust. Post and The Royal Mail may be contributing to the delays some buyers are experiencing??  After the internal  corruption of Custom's Officers was uncovered earlier this year, Customs would have undoubtedly made some significant changes in critical areas which had previously facilitated the alleged corruption to take place. There's no doubt their operation on a whole would have been tightened up at every point along the way. That doesn't mean things won't get through though. Vendors can't remain stagnant on the issue of packaging. Research and experimentation on new methods/materials needs to continue and the ongoing development of anything promising is a must!

     Because? The fact is, 90% of us are good citizens who wouldn't be ordering if there was a good chance of getting caught.  They still have to prove you ordered and paid for the item, which is why only a handful of people have been convicted world wide most of whom confessed.

     What makes you think that something is happening?? What reports are you referring to? Just because some people are not receiving their orders, doesn't mean Customs are doing a blitz on International mail. It's all to do with a vendor's packaging! The materials used, the actual stealth used, the look of the package, the labeling, etc. Sure some packages won't get through Customs for what ever reason but if the vendor is skilled in the art of stealth, chances are your package will arrive, safe and sound. Speaking from personal experience, I've only lost one order and that was well over a year ago now and to be honest, I doubt it was ever sent. I'm happy to be proven wrong but I don't remember any news articles on Customs blitzing International Mail in Australia. Yes they may have improved their detection techniques including new profiling profiles, etc, but if the vendor is good at their job and does it right, there's every chance your order will arrive.  8)

    I know of one UK vendor that has a lot of missing/late shipments to AU, all different envelopes, sizes, return addys, used MBB as well posted on different days from different locations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either that or there are some ridiculous delays going on at the moment, that vendor has just updated their page with the following statement "PLEASE ACCEPT WAITING UP TO 2 MONTHS FOR PACKAGES TO AUS. SEEMS UK -&gt; AUS POST IS REALLY SLOW AT THE MOMENT. WE CANNOT SORT REFUNDS OR RESHIPS UNTIL 60 DAYS HAS PASSED AS THEY ARE BEING DELAYED FOR SOME REASON, BUT ARE COMING THROUGH SLOWLY."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is slow and then there is 2 months slow! I have never has anything arrive from the UK after 18 days, if it hasn't landed before then in my experience its not coming.

    I have posted in other threads recently stating that AU customs is screening a lot more letter mail than it used too. Some people though this was bullshit but I am not in the habit of posting FUD.

    I'm about to write off a UK order, been over 3 weeks now and in my experience that means it ain't coming but of course I will be more than happy to be proven wrong for a change and have a very late arrival next week ;)

    I have had 4 legit commercial packages arrive from the UK in the last week or two, all were about a week later than usual give or take.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On a side note, a friend had an order show up from a big German seller that should have arrived at least 2 months ago, it was sent when indicated, so big mail delays do happen....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for scanning large volumes of mail, (and I'm not having a go at SSBD or anyone else here) I'm not so sure that they would delay masses of legit mail looking for a small percentage of personal volume drug orders. I just couldn't see them giving enough of a shit TBH.  There is no obvious pressure on Aussie LE to shut down SR activities. At this stage it is being treated as a taboo/human interest/shock story by the media, and no politicians or interest groups are pursuing it publicly as far as i can see...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I honestly think that even when they announce that they have done a blitz and confiscated heaps of orders (which there has been little evidence of in terms of the % of stuff getting through in the past) it is purely propaganda.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still think getting caught, if they could without a confession wouldn't be pretty though.

    Yep game over guys customs won.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets make heaps more AUS treats again like back in the day,
    <br/>
    and cry about how tough customs are and how there scanning
    <br/>
    every enveloppe and...oehhooeee a dingo ate my baby.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping vary's from 6 to 21 days from my experience and if you pick
    <br/>
    your vendor carefully you will have no issues, from my experience even
    <br/>
    these days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just be patient and if it doesn't show, it happens! "Keep smiling, sit thight, next address"
    <br/>
    This ain't frigging ebay bitches. Try a different vendor/ part of the world, as to me it
    <br/>
    seems that they target countries randomly and inpecting them with extra care from time to time so maybe UK is being given a bit more attention than usual, and therefore the mail might take a bit longer
    <br/>
    and a few more packages than usual go missing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay positive :)

    People tend to come on and tell everyone more often when they don't receive anything compared to how many come on to say they did receive it. People need to vent when something bad happens whereas if something good happens they are happy and move on...That is why I think it seems like more people are losing packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If somebody does not get an overseas order they are much more inclined to join the forums and try figure out why it never came or is being delayed. If someone got their package I do not see anyone coming on the forums just to post "I got my order from ****." Because no one really cares...

    I'm still optimistic my other orders will arrive but yeah pretty confident one german order from a very top rated seller isn't going to arrive as it got sent with another aus order for a different customer which already arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Who knows maybe it's just caught up somewhere in the mail service but I'm not expecting it now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm only in for personal small orders so losing a couple is no biggie
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was pleased to find out another german order got shipped more than a week late which could be the reason its not here.

    As a vendor I can say that Australia is actually tough to ship to. I randomize my packaging as much as possible when shipping there but around 30% of all the customers I get from there report packs not arriving. Imho Australia and Scandinavia check their mail pretty harshly. It could be that its that the fact that im shipping from the Netherlands has something to do with it.

    Hey mate.

    Your location is definitely a big part of it. The NL is a major flagged country for Australian customs. A 70% rate is actually pretty decent.

     After the internal  corruption of Custom's Officers was uncovered earlier this year, Customs would have undoubtedly made some significant changes in critical areas which had previously facilitated the alleged corruption to take place. There's no doubt their operation on a whole would have been tightened up at every point along the way.

    My friend who works customs at a major airport said after that incident happened the only major changes have been that now they get randomly drug tested, and they only find out what job they will be doing that day when they get to work. By job I mean, checking peoples bags, randomly walking around, checking the CCTV etc etc. Previously they knew what job they would be doing a few weeks in advance, and for how long which would of made it easy for them to organise "helping" friends and what not.  Customs apparantly has no budget, and no plans to get more budget. They very rarely hire.  My friend doesn't get any info regarding mail sorting though... hopefully one day they will change positions to the mail sorting centre ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs at the airports really seems to be lacking in the last 1-2 years. I've been overseas maybe 4 times in the last 18 months and only once was I directed to the customs/AQIS hall, where I declared a wooden item, showed it to the quarantine people and was on my way. My last trip back their was a single guy from quarantine standing by the exit checking peoples (hugggeee line) declaration cards. He pretty much let 100% of people through.. even some of the ones you know would of definetly had wierd prohibited food/plant items.

     They trap in smell and moisture. Sniffer dogs can't smell through them. But, they are foil so they are detectable via x-rays.

     Also, Aus customs isn't that much different to other countries. Their effectiveness has really been blown out of proportion.

    The foil layer in MBBs is so thin that it does not have almost any effect when x-rayed, if packaged correctly. It will not show up as an lump of metal in the screen if that's what you thought.
