    I'm sure this is covered here somewhere but a search brought up nothing for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are there any downsides of renting a box at a UPS Store to take SR deliveries or a similar mail receiving service?  I have done this for legal mail delivery when I needed a box b/c I could not get mail where I was living so I know how it all works.  I am not talking about a PO Box at the post office, these are not po boxes, they are technically a regular street address so anything can be sent there (usps, ups, fed ex).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would have regular mail sent there also of course, junk mail and all that shit.  Just want to make sure there is not some known reason not to do it.  I have recently had a non SR non drug related package marked as delivered but was never on my stoop.  I am in an area where a package could definitely be taken off my stoop that I share with a few more units and is right off the sidewalk where the kids tote pistols.   ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts or tips???  Much appreciated.

    UPS boxes are the creme de la creme in my opinion
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They sign, they are open 24 hrs, they see large volume mail of mail and all sorts so they never raise an eyebrow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They also contest police searches without warrants ... they take mail privacy seriously.

    I wasn't planning on using a fake ID.  Anybody think that is too terrible an idea?  I don't have one....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I was planning on picking up mail after they are closed.  I think you get a key to get inside and get your mail at any time right?

    You can get a fake ID on SR.. If your going to be sending stuff to your mail box you need to know that they will only put stuff in that mail box that is addressed to the owner of the mail box... So if you open the box in your name (tim) and then send some hash there to (Jonathan) it might not make it to the box and you could loose out.. I have seen it happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suggest opening a box far from where you live or know people.. somewhere you wont run into anyone you know and use a fake ID.. Its really easy to open a mail box.. there gonna take a few photocopies of your ID and make you sign a paper... Then your in business.. At that point you order other things to the mail box legit under the fake name... (freebie information from tv ads ect) Even send yourself stuff to the fake name...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once you have done this you should be good to roll.. and yes you can get a box at locations that close and can go get your mail after all employees are gone for the day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there will be a camera watching tho!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also If you know a notary you can even pretend to be from a different state/country when you open one up and not even go in to open the box.. but thats a whole different discussion!

    Open the box under a business name. They will let ya put up to 3 names on a box and they dont ask for any proof of the business existing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Makes mail volume look believable.

    I tried the signing up with a fake business thing. They asked for the owner of the business and the location. I gave my name and home address (no fake ID, didn't know what else to do. I came in with the suggestion to use a fake business and wasn't expecting all these questions). They afterwords asked, "Is this a registered corporation" to which I felt I had to say no to (since it wasn't). They said something like, "that makes sense" and the rest went just fine. I've used it a couple times but I often get a twinge of nervousness when I think about having it registered under that fake business name; could I potentially get in trouble for that?

    Really ? Weird.

    I have been using UPS boxes for a couple years now, always under business names.

    Never had a second question about it.

    So you just go in and fill out a form with a business name and what, a fake address for the business?  It would seem odd to have to have an address when trying to obtain an address but it sounds like that is how UPS stores do it?   I am trying to remember how it worked when I did it but that was years ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think I may just use my real info.  My main concern is having my packages stolen off my stoop or a controlled delivery attempted where I live and will be stashing...

    Where I live they also require a thumbprint on the USPS form (required when you rent a private box). There is a way to slyly distort the print, easy to find if you google it, JJ Luna talks about it on his site. Also, have heard applying a light coat of Elmer's to the thumb will do the same thing.

    Is a fake ID really needed if you doing this? I mean, worst can happen is police stakeout, then they go to your real home and search for more stuff, they will do that fake id or not. Even in the event they plan to do this, they check your name and id number first? does your country doesn't have this? My country register Name + ID number for all things that requires ID, called RUT. You can fake them to enter the system but if the police check it, they'll know is fake, so more reasons to arrest you and building a case against you? At least that is how it goes down here. Or maybe fake ID because they wont do a stakeout but they will register your name in some log and wont receive the items there anymore?
