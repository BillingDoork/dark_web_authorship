    Like a lot of you out there I am prone to watching for the mail man coming and I know his movements and times off by heart, So imagine my surprise when he missed out my entire side of the road one morning and did it again two days later, Is this new policy for royal mail or just when they are busy I want to complain but dont want to draw attention to myself for obvious reasons
    <br/>
    can anyone help explain this as it seems they are in breach of there obligation

    maybe there justÂ  wasn't any mail for anyone?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    seems a bit unlikely though if there are a lot of houses on your street

    How often do you think the postman gets asked about a specific letter??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the point when you're potentially risking security due to a small inconvenience, you're not playing this game carefully enough.

    Sounds like the postman is trying to save time, the following day he'll likely just do your side of the road. Postal rounds are so large now that they can't finish them in time if they deliver all the mail.
