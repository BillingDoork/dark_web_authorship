    Has anyone received products in oz from the Netherlands?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I heard a rumor it is on a high alert list and was wondering if that is possibly why my mdma never arrived, however i received the same product from other countries...

    LSD  &amp; MDMA  have made it through from the NL according to friends, people on this forum and various sellers.  It's always a lucky dip.  I'm sure some gets stolen by employees, some confiscated and letter sent, some binned, some lost etc.

    Pick your vendor. Stealth shipping should be a higher priority than price. Smart sellers will work this out and be able to charge a premium for their extra effort.

    1 success and awaiting 2 which look like being fails at the now 3 week mark. Transactions done outside of escrow as the vendor is very wary of shipping to some countries. I'm cool with this as I feel the vendor is trustworthy. Much easier to use a UK based vendor as you are correct the NL is treated as a high alert country.
