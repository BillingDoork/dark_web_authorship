    I just received a parcel in the mail today and I haven't ordered anything else and the stuff that I ordered already had already arrived last week. So I'm guessing it is my shipment of the 50x and 25x of mortal kombats from the netherlands. But here's the weird thing, there's nothing inside of the letter except a folded blank card which I'm guessing was used to conceal it maybe. At first I was trying to open the letter but then I noticed that on the left side of the envelope someone had already opened it, most likely with a letter opener, because of the cleaner cut that it usually leaves. After opening it up there was nothing inside except for the folded blank card. This was the only letter I received today and I really hope it didn't get seized but if it did that's weird because usually don't they take the whole envelope?  I went from excitement to seeing the letter to having my heart jump out of my chest because it was already opened and empty... and I fear the unknown consequences...

    <br/>
    What do you guys think happened or is going on?
    <br/>
    1. Mailman jacked me?
    <br/>
    2. Someone at the sorting center took it.
    <br/>
    3. Confiscated, awaiting a letter or maybe a controlled delivery?

    Do you mean two listings that equal to 75 pills?  Got kind of confused when I read 50x and 25x.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways man, I think it could be either 1 or 2.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was taken at customs you wouldn't have gotten anything except maybe a love letter.

    I always repeat to the vendors:
    <br/>
    please, close the envelopes (including the edges) well with super glue!!!
    <br/>
    there are also many dishonest mailmen, touching  realize that the letters contain objects and steal them  :o

    A couple of years ago I had a letter returned to me where the side of the envelope was split open.  Everything was in the envelope.  I think it was a matter of wear on the envelope.  International mail seems to take a beating.

    True story.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Very first order on Sr from vendor fredthebaker: 100 1mg xanax pills from India.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had to sign for the package and while I was signing I saw VISIBLY that one side of the letter had been opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    60% of my product was still in the envelope, but I am for certain that a customs agent skimmed or a postal worker skimmed my product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my opinion.

    You signed for a package from india? Rethink or establish a SR best practice policy for ordering gear

    with todays stealth, i believe that a majority of missing packages (especially domestic ones) result from theiving mailman or postal workers. Even when a pack is busted in the mail, why would a postal inspector report it if he can just keep it for himself?
    <br/>
    Well of course you have the honest ones who will report it but people at customs are just as crooked when it comes to incoming packs, especially when they see Netherlands on it

    Well if the OP is really worried, he can order alot of ebay or amazon packs to throw the mailman off, then he could order a couple of SR packs domestically and sees what happens. If those are ok, try ordering something legit from china or european country and eventually order SR from europe. This is all being paranoid of course. If you order stuff from a vendor who packs it in a more secure method than just an envelope  the mailman will have trouble getting into it..
