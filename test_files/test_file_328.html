    it says in processed in sort facility and has not said inbound into customs or anything. though it is a registered letter. So, i hear this is normal?
    <br/>
    well anyway the local tracking from where it was sent. for the last week said arrived in desination country, and is preparing for shipment to addressee
    <br/>
    now it just says arrived in country USA on that date! it does not say preparing to ship? so this is bad? i mean do you think it means was seized or maybe on the good not it departed and did not update and will be on the way to local post for delivery in next 2 days?
    <br/>
    its got to be one or the other?
    <br/>
    any vets newbies anyone who has had a similar situation!
    <br/>

    From my experience with Royal Mail when ordering from the UK to the USA, that just means it arrived in the USA. It doesn't track is like US tracking, once it arrives in the US it'll say that.

    from asia part of the world. and its odd it said since the day it arrived in usa on the local site from country it was sent form. that it arrived in usa and is preparing shipping to addressee.
    <br/>
    now it just says arrived in either the city it was sent from or usa and has the date! it changed today after a week of being the same and not for the good it does not sound?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and the usps tracking just says processed through sorting facility. Now inbound or outbound. I heard registered mail does not usually say inbound or out?
    <br/>
    any how its been on that for almost 9 days! and no change? registered international mail! i will never f'en use it again! i got out of signing last time for it because post here does not require but shit i may as well have it sent express and get it in a week and see it go inbound and out! but does anyone have any similar experiences,
    <br/>
    anyone else and ill give you a +! in a min and anyone who gives some good advice or more helpful experiences!
    <br/>
    thank you in advance!

    I think its just slow USPS.  Got a registered pack coming as well...hit the sorting center over two weeks ago...no inbound or outbound.  It won't be updated until it is delivered, I believe.  So sit tight and relax.    From the 'sorted at processing center' it has to go through customs...then out...and then delivered.

    I would pay attention to the USPS tracking instead of the original country's tracking. It's with the USPS now after all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS can be surprisingly fast or brutally slow. I've had shipments in the sort facility/customs that would leave the next day or get stuck for nearly two weeks. It's weird.

    thank you both i gave you +1 for your time and good input! i am glad to hear i am not the only one in that boat! but next time no registered because you no they go to the bottom of the barrell! since no fixed delivery date! like within 3to 5 days or 7 to 10 it gets stamped must ship within 30 days i read that!
    <br/>
    but i do not check tracking every day but i will on off days check the other tracking! this is why i noticed this! to be honest i go by what usps says! I have had item there for a hour go inbound for 23min and outbound and then to the next stop!! no bs then i have had one site for a month!
    <br/>
    fuckers I got a better chance on trying to figure out every woman and they way their mind works before i will figure out usps! LOL
    <br/>
    sad but true! they are unpredicable!
    <br/>
    anyone one else please keep it coming and thanks again gues you got your +1s for your time! as you should
