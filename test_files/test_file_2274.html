    i met a man on a bus today who had recently takeb several g of pentedrone (and ethylphen) through a commercial flight in checked baggage. he apparently had noticed that melatonin sold at drug stores is a fine white powder packed tightly into small, slightly tinted caps that are easy to open. he swore that you couldn't tell the two pills apart without opening them, and that it blended in well with a few other otc sleep aids in his bag. (of course, i told him that this is a serious offense and nobody should do this... and that he shouldn't brag about his exploits to strangers. but im glad he did.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ... because he also said that in just over 24hrs, the pent had dissolved the end of the cap that held a small, trapped pocket of air. the side that was packed very tightly held up ok but was a little soft. the end that dissolved was fully removed by the substance and it, upon reaching air, began dissolving the other caps around it, good caps and tampered-with caps. lucky for him, he had packed cotton tightly in the top which migrated down and mostly sealed off the cap-wounds. the opened caps produced a much stronger smell, but all inspections were performed just after packing the caps. Also, it was difficult to pull any of them out for inspection since they were glued together with melted cap.

    thought this may be useful.
