    Has anyone ever had 1/4 (7 grams) of weed delivered to a post office box? Is this safe to do? I might do it, but I'm pretty nervous about it. I'd have it shipped to my home address, but I don't live alone. I have a 5"x 5.5" PO Box. I might also have up to 1/4 of shrooms delivered to the box too. I'm just paranoid about having them sent to the post office. Are these safe things to do?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also: How do I sign my address up for some junk mail so that there's a variety of mail coming in? I won't be having drug packages shipped there frequently, just once in a while and only weed and psychedelic drugs.

    Perfectly safe.Â  Or, as safe as a normal address anyway.

    You can request catalogues from random companies - they're generally free.

    You're totally fine to get anything shipped there, so long as it fits in your box! Perhaps check with the vendor you choose to make sure this will be the case. Best of luck!

    Ok, thanks :) I'll do those things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One more thing. I know it's highly illegal for them to open the packages. But, If for some reason the package is bigger than I expected, and it doesn't fit in my box, what will happen? Will they just have to hold it at the desk for me?

    I've had 2 ounces of weed delivered to my box from overseas, it went smooth. If your box isn't big enough, yes they will hold it at the desk for you. You should be fine dude.

    at my old place my mail was delivered to a post office and has a small box exactly like the one your using. The standard Express letters (260 x 159 mm) dont fit unless they kind of bend it and put it on an angle. They always put a little card in there and I just had to grab it and bring it inside and the lady at the desk would give it to me, no signature or anything real smooth and easy. only once did they cram it in the box like i said on an angle and with a crease in it. but only that once, I never said or asked them anything, but I bet if you didnt want to go inside you could ask them to just go ahead and cram them in your box.(just say you dont care if there bent and that you work odd hours and cant make it till after they close usually.) I thought about this, but I actually didnt want them to bend it and I made a point of being friendly and talkative to the post office worker (it was mostly 1 person). Because I thought it would be more suspicious if i was quiet and avoided them and acted suspicious like.

    if your getting your stuff thru regular mail (regular smaller envelopes) they of course fit
