    I've ordered to packages from EU to Sweden. First was from Chemical Brothers, 2 ecstacy tablets that never made it here. I never even got a customs letter so I'm just going to assume he never sent it to begin with. Got 50% refund. From Netherlands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: Chemical Brothers DID send the package. He is very much legit :) CHEMICAL BROTHERS FTW!!!! :) The problem is that customs took it from me xD lol. But he did send the right amount tho because they told me in the customs letter (for some reason).
    <br/>

    I'm currently waiting for a second parcel from Evilution, 1 gram MDMA. I had to FE though so it's hard to know if he ever sent it or not. He's good on communication though and has good reviews so I hope he's good on his promise and sent it over. From Belgium.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll update in this thread if I ever get my package.
    <br/>

    A friend of mine who lives in Sweden has ordered 200 tabs of Tramadol from Gotmilk. We will see if it ever shows up. It was his first order and a rather large one at that. It was supposed to get there last week and/or monday/tuesday but still not showed up. My buddy asked for tracking # but then SR fucked up and now we're all just waiting for DPR to fix this mess.
