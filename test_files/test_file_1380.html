    I figure they'll have a hard time rifling through the junk, making it more likely they wont fuck with me droogs. Anyone else think this is a good idea?

    I think most packages are going to stand out through Junk Mail.... Besides if your vendor is using enough stealth no postal worker is going to risk losing their job and getting a felony over stealing a legit piece of mail they have no use for. If a package stands out to a mail man then your vendor/s aren't doing a good enough job...In my honest opinion, all vendors should disguise their drugs within legitimate products. No mail man is going to steal a piece of mail with a box of cheezits in it or something loud like that.

    Any mailman would be suspicious if they came across someone mailing cheezits, it's a good idea to disguise the goods, but it should be in something that's not suspicious and it should have a similar look on an x-ray.
