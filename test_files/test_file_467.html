    Was picking up a substantial amount of priority stamps as of recent and was informed by multiple employees and locations that they will NOT be receiving any further shipments of these stamps once each office runs out. This is not a region or per location thing. I was given intel that this isn't something they are advertising. The push is to make all priority to be printed shipping or over the counter after these are gone. STOCK UP VENDORS!!!!!!!

    Luckily they are being replaced :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All USPS is doing is fazing out the odd denomination stamps, that they had to change every year when postage went up.
    <br/>
    They have already been replaced by a 5 dollar stamp, which just means you need to buy some 10 or 20 cent stamps as well.

    USPS.com is still selling the $5.15 stamp...
    <br/>
    I have a hard time believing that they are going to get rid of priority postage all together.
    <br/>
    This would mean doubling the lines at the PO which can already be a nightmare to deal with.
    <br/>
    And if they do get rid of it then it will be time to fight back and get everyone pissed off about it and start an online campaign to bring it back.

    Nice info Rocker. Good to know. Well my area is trolling us all then. They acted like nothing was being made to replace this.... I will be slapping 5 dollar stamps and others along with it now. I refuse to get clicknship solution workarounds. Too much risk.

    priority mail flat rate pricing is changing in late January.Â  I believe with DCN or tracking will now be included and that the retail cost will be something like $5.80 for a small flat rate box.
