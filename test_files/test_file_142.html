    My mailbox which is in a usps mailbox cluster mailbox stand for the neighborhood has been locked. I was expecting a pkg. yesterday from SR when I went to check the mail, well the box was locked. Does this mean that the pkg. was intercepted?
    <br/>
    I have yet to get a knock on the door by LE or a love letter from the local post office or postal inspector. Just waiting for all hell to break out.
    <br/>
    The order was small amount just pharma.
    <br/>
    Kinda freaking.
    <br/>
    Busy cleaning house. I run TOR of an encrypted USB drive so nothing on hard drive. I msg.ed the other vendors that I have orders with still yet to arrive.
    <br/>
    Any advice on how to deal with this I would greatly appreciate.
    <br/>
    Thnx,

    Relax!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your mailbox being locked has ZERO to do with SR. Wait until tomorrow(Monday) and ask your mailman what the problem is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All you did was make an order of Rx of SR and you think the post office chose your package to open, then found Rx in it, so the decided to lock your box? LOL. Impossible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I understand you are paranoid. But just think about the situation and you will see that there is no way your box was locked because of your order off of Silk Road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just take some deep breaths and relax. It will all be good tomorrow. Nothing is worse then placing an order of SR and there being some sort of problem. Your mind will race and for some reason it always races to the worst possible scenario! Then the best feeling is going to the mailbox and your package is there! And your probably like everyone else and when you go to your box and get your package, you then "look around" to see if anyone is watching..lol..and no one ever is :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It will be all good. The worst part is that it is Sunday and you have to wait..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Give us an update tomorrow when you talk to the mailman and you realize everything is fine :)

    ;D Trying to be inconspicuous while checking the mailbox but looking up and down the street for anyone watching. Calmly check for mail then running back inside with it...

    I think it is understated here that people need to act as any normal person would when dealing with their mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Oh! I got a package in the mail, I wonder what it is? A free shampoo sample? (would be nice, I'm out right now  :))"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Open your package at your convenience, as this is what most anyone would do who IS NOT ordering sketchy things thru the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally, for Rhubarb: Don't worry for the reasons already stated in this thread, and also, locks are not a feasible to change in your hypothetical theory. A postie would need various tool (correct sized screwdriver, plyers, and of course a new lock). This seems like regular postal shit to me! Regardless, you didn't order anything anyway  :) It's funny what u can get when u give ur address to tons of website to try samples and enter contests. I think saying you order a lot of samples would be a great cover actually. Higher volume of mail = less reason to suspect the package of gear, as you have so many. You also get free samples and shit  ;D cant go wrong.

    No worries...
    <br/>
    It was the posties mistake why he locked the mailbox still remains a mystery.
    <br/>
    Sorry to include you in my paranoid ranting and psychobabble.
    <br/>
    Thnx to everyone how posted comments - it is really a community.
