    my pack cleared customs thursday night. So usually it goes to the hub in that city within the next day. Then i thought well maybe because the weekend even though we all know are open on weekends. So i hoped it would move monday. then i chalked it up to pres day and today still nothing. I mean i did not check every day!!! ever 3. but still i checked just now and nothing it says
    <br/>
    inbound out of customs
    <br/>
    fucking weird it said it arrived and 3 days later inbound out did not even say inbound in? maybe missed scan? Now i am getting worried.
    <br/>
    I thought that since it says cleared us customs. tab when you click for explaination by inbound out of customs. I was good, Well A, I?
    <br/>
    Any opinions. vets please to anyone who had similar experience i will give +1 for positive feedback! i hate people who dont when you take your time to try and help so you have my word i will.
    <br/>
    we must stick together on this long and beautiful road
    <br/>
    thanks in advance! hope to hear some input soon im getting nervous
    <br/>
    thanks

    You can go to a local PO and give them the number.  If you KNOW it's cleared customs, this is safe to do.  Unfortunately, the information they give you might not be any better than what you see online.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS tracking is a joke.  Typically, even on domestic stuff, you see point of origin, and then the postal facility it scanned into first.  Next thing you know, it's in your mailbox.  Wish I could give you a better answer.

    no need to go to local post and i would be hesitant to do that, No need because you were right it did not update from inbound out of customs until it arrived today!:)

    thanks for input

    Sweet!  Yeah, in hindsight, I'd be kind of hinky about going in and asking, although I live in a rural area and can drive to at least 2 POs where there aren't any cameras on the counter.  But, anyway, glad you got your stuff.
