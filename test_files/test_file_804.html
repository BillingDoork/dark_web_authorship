    I'm still a noob here, but I was hoping to be placed in the right direction if I'm wrong.
    <br/>
    I recently made some of my first purchases here on SR. All of them were priority and they were simply left in my mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One of the orders was Priority, I wasnt home and a tag was left saying they attempted delivery. I'm kinda freaked about it and I'm just gonna blow it off.
    <br/>
    So the main question here is, can I take the Vendor to Resolution to get my bitcoins back or some sort of refund?
    <br/>
    Seems to me like im being set up for a controlled delivery and would rather pass on picking it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my opinion, this is a lost package and feel the Vendor should split the loss with me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is my logic right on this?

    I am going to assume you most likely have a small mailbox, and the mailman did not want to bend the priority envelope to fit it in there or leave it at your door. Under that assumption, no should have no right to take him to resoloution. Really, you are not being set up for a controlled delivery. They would knock on your door, it's not like they are going to have cops WAITING at the post office for the random time that you decide to pick up your (most likely) personal stash of drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Overly cautious never hurts, but I think this is just straight up paranoia.
    <br/>
    [Edit] And most vendors won't give you any sort of refund if it returns to sender because of something on your end. They have done everything they can on their end, what more do you want from them?

    No you shouldent recieve a refund because it would be your fault. I've had this happen before. If the mailbox is too small then they come to the door.
    <br/>
    Priority also means you have to sign from some postal services, they can't give you the pack until you sign. It is just company policy and NOTHING BAD will come from it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its not like it is risky or they are suspicious so they make you pick it up. Just google about the attempted delivery, it happens all the time.

    Thank you for the responses. It is possible that the envelope didnt fit in box. None the less, I've already decided not to go get it.
    <br/>
    So do I have a leg to stand on to at least get 50% back? This is probably for the best for both vendor &amp; I if it's a CD dont you think?
    <br/>
    I dont know..I still think 50% would be fair.

    If I were the vendor, I would fight it. If they can prove they shipped it you will likely not see a refund (unless they want to, there are plenty of vendors who aren't afraid to lose a bit of cash to go that extra step. I wouldn't expect for them to let you order again, however.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Overly cautious is okay, but you should have to eat the loss for choosing to do so. Just my opinion.

    This is not a controlled delivery. USPS simply missed you or the package was too big to fit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Schedule a redelivery online or go pick it up at the post office. I GUARANTEE nothing bad will happen. This has happened to me numerous times. The first time I freaked out a little like you did but did some reasearch and realized a CD takes TIME and EFFORT to plan out. LE isn't going to wait outside the post office all day for you to decide to go pick up your goods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are hesitant to go in to the post office then schedule a redelivery online. I did this and my package came on the day I chose. Of course I had to be there at the time of delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: A vendor should NOT have to refund anything for this. The package arrived successfully but you are not picking it up due to paranoia. Plain and simple. Vendor did everything on their part.

    This is 100% your loss if you do not pick it up, the vendor should be paid in full. He fulfilled his side of the transaction 100%, its up to you to pick it up, or take the cost of the order as it arrived but you never picked it up.

    If you knew you had to sign for it and you don't go sign for it, suck it up and take the loss. IF the vendor used a method that required signature, but it wasn't advertised that way, or you requested that they use another method to which they agreed, then that is a different story. Also, if the order is too big for your mail bin....it's your fault for ordering something in that quantity.

    Y'all calling dude a punk, but consider the circumstances of what each of us do every fuckin day. We send and receive Schedule 1 narcotics through the Federal postal system (some Schedule 2's, 3's, and 4's, too, but who gives a fuck about that weak shit. Well maybe some of the 2's, and the benzos in the 4th...) Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yeah... quit jumping all over dude for this shit. Similar thing just happened to me, but it was a false alarm. Everyone is right, this isn't a controlled delivery. However, better safe than sorry, or one day one of you complacent fucktards is going to waltz your way right into a prison cell. Be careful, don't forget what we're doing on here, it isn't about fucking around and taking it easy. Doesn't mean you should have tinfoil on your windows and take a 10 mile backtracking loop to get home, just be cautious. If something out of the ordinary occurs (like getting one of the little cards in place of a package; in my case, the envelope could have EASILY been left in the box) then just be cautious is all I'm saying.

    It's one thing to get freaked out and refuse a delivery, and another thing entirely to expect the vendor to lose out due to customer paranoia.  He did his part, and got the package in the post.  Anything beyond that is out of his control, unless he severely fucked up the packaging somehow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for refusing delivery, have you given any thought to what happens to the package then?  It doesn't just simply disappear.  I for one wouldn't be comfortable knowing that a package containing drugs, with my name and address on it, would be opened by some random entity, at some undetermined point in the future.  If you are lucky, whoever eventually opens it will just steal the shit for themselves, but it's more likely that it will be handed to the cops.

    Man up and collect your package, or at the very least pay the vendor.  He did what he was supposed to do.

    This guy is pretty much fucked if he doesn't pick up his package. It will more than likely be opened by some random person or LE. Vendors do not put their own address as the return address. This guy isn't using his head.

    Go pick up your package and stop being a pussy. If they were going to bust you, they would come back and bust you....its not like the police are gonna sit all day at the post office waiting for someone who they've never seen before....

    Also...YOUR AN IDIOT FOR THINKING YOU CAN GET A REFUND CAUSE YOUR PARANOID...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mailing drugs is one of the safest ways i've seen of getting a product across country and state lines, As long as your vendor knows what the fuck they are doing, noone will ever know what is in that package but you.

     In my opinion, this is a lost package and feel the Vendor should split the loss with me.

     Is my logic right on this?

    Go get your package, or call the Post Office and get them to re-deliver it,   Why should the vendor have to fight a 50% loss just because you are too much of a chicken shit to go get what's yours?  Man the fuck up- this isn't a controlled delivery.  They don't begin with a note on your door or in your mailbox.

    I'm not pissed that you're too afraid to go pick up your package...  It's your fucked up rationale that somehow the vendor should split the loss with you and share responsibility for your own cowardice that irks me.
