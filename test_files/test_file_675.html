    The H was domestic, and opened from one part of the top, like as if the postman had done it, and the other from abroad, was cut along where the lick-flap is.
    <br/>
    the items were still in there,..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    maybe theyre arranging a raid, possibly waiting untill im intoxicated so i'll test positive?
    <br/>
    or they see they were just small amounts -Â  1g pink amphet and 0.3g domestic H.. and decided to let it pass. - not worth their while.
    <br/>
    the one that was mechanically opened with a zigzag line, possibly by a specialised letter cutter, was pink speed, and wasnt vacumed. maybe dogs smelled it and when opened, they see the bright pink stuff and thought wtf is that? decided not to test it. or tested it anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    has anyone else had this? i've told the receiver to write return to sender and leave it on the kitchen side, before taking them to the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what's likely to happen?

    Looks like there waiting for more orders to make charges stick, was there any shit missing so they could test it? Sorry Im from the states so I don't know alot about how British police work. U also need to have future stuff to a different spot such as a PO box under a fake name. Hope that helps brova

    Had something similar happen before. Two cuts made in the envelope and it was clear as day what was in it, and you were talking enough for a sentence anyway. Still got it no bother, and got stuff afterwards to the same place too. Strange, the UK is.
