    As far as I have read about package seizing and making controlled delivery, people always talk about coke, meth, LSD or something like that, but not WEED. I am wondering what weight of marihuana should be safe to order and do not worry about controlled delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And what, for example, if my package comes from US and gets seized in France, but the delivery address is in Poland/Sweden or something like that(far away from country which have seized the package) and the package contains 200-300g of marihuana and it needs controlled delivery. Will they bother to contact Poland/Sweden DEA to make controlled delivery for this amount?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you got what I meant.

    the only time i have read about weed getting intercepted was when someone ordered several lbs and the packaging was shitty(taped sides,written address) like that 10lb bust because the package got returned to a kmart in washington even though the package was sent from california. stupid stuff like that is why people get caught. your overseas so i would be careful ordering anything! especially weed. the vacuum seals could start to leak before it got to you. but i personally never order more than a oz at a time for personal use.

    And mostly my orders will be overseas, because for my needs I find only vendor from overseas. If you know any 20-200g weed vendor who sells  for price I need, who is in overseas, best option EU, I would be a lot grateful, or option to make customize/special order, but regular order, if any vendor reads this or anyone else have some opinion.

    What do you want to hear? The truth is there is no safe amount of any ILLEGAL substance that you can say you could not get in trouble for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But you can take your precautions, to wit:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buy from a reputable vendor that is known to have professional packaging.
    <br/>
    Have a safe location for a delivery. Not your flat. Not a place where any illegal substance is kept or illegal activities take place ever.
    <br/>
    Secure your computer
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And then it's pretty reasonable to say that a good majority of your orders in quantities for personal use will not have a problem. And if something does go wrong then there's a good chance there is not enough evidence against you.

    Anything over 5g is risky IMO.

    Envelopes should be small, light and discreet.

    IMO, the best path to take is one that begins with small orders of ozs from several reputable, respected vendors, and step up the quantity with those you can trust...  You shouldn't be shooting for the moon with a few Ps for your first order.... Or maybe you should, it's up to you

    the moon...nah just trying to put sum crumbs on da table....
    <br/>
    good advice though...i second your motion it is always best to start small....
    <br/>
    get to know your vendors especially how good their packaging is....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i would rather pay more for a slightly inferior product that i know will get through customs due to good packaging than pay less for a better product with poor packaging....

    Research for a vendor with outstanding stealth then work your way up once you begin to feel a bit more comfortable with the stealth/ customs situation.

    We don't know what country you're in but I'll warn you to not get a false sense of security because deliveries are working for other people.  You can play the odds game if you want but in many countries the punishment for losing is severe.

    i like that...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i have sobered up a piece...start small and move up if you feel comfortable....
    <br/>
    also try and find a vendor who has good stealth cos to me this is so important when ordering
    <br/>
    especially for those in countries with tough customs.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for me packaging and stealth is number one...product quality is always secondary to this...
    <br/>
    eliminate as much risk as you can when ordering..
    <br/>
    knowledge..preparation are the best strategies...

    I started ordering some small packages from reputable vendors, then I found a favorite after ordering small amounts, then I started ordering 200g + and it all worked out fine everytime, I use a different address for every shipment, almost.

    There's only so much that stealth etc at the sellers end can do for hiding a bulk purchase. Unless you're using a method which can fool x-ray machines there is always going to be risk. Really for something as smelly and bulky as weed if you're needing large amounts regularly it'd probably be much cheaper just to set up your own grow op. That said there are ways of getting large amounts around but usually that tends to be when the buyer and seller know each other and have established methods already.
