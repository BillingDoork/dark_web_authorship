    Right section I hope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you think is a reasonable amount of time to expect someone to finalize, with drugs it's one thing, testing comes into play. But for an item that needs to sampling such as cash or a non drug item?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Especially when most people want their shit in 2 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?

    Me being a customer, Just saying i check out what iv been sent and then i go ahead and Finalize .. I mean i always check it and test it but iv never gone over 3 hours with out finalizing a deal. Its only right. If a rightious vendor gets your pills or H whatever to you in a reasonable time and you test it pretty much within the hour , or with pills i dont know about this new generation who are out there snorting Loratabs and loving fake xanax, but i can look at a pill and if it gets passed these eyes, youv done damn good.. With H its pretty clear from the Go..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I look at it like i want my drugs, so when i get them and its all good, i know he vendor is waiting on his money like i waited on my drugs just tables turn, so i Finalize soon as i verify.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just thought id add my 2btc in..As a Buyer..

    As a customer, connectivity allowing, day of receipt, next day at the latest if a package arrives and I'm out all day.

    I expect a reasonable level of promptness from vendors regarding them getting products into transit, it is only fair that I offer them the same level of courtesy.

    As soon as possible is preferred, but I don't find 2-3 days unreasonable because I know shit happens, ISP issues, computer issues, life, etc. Anything over that I consider bad SR manners. The only time I've made an exception to this was during hurricane's Isaac/Sandy, for obvious reasons.

    yeah, I think most people do the same, that's not unreasonable. It's the people who get their shit then wait ten days to finalize...probably because they're out and they want to order more lol

    Yea, that would be nice lol. Only in a perfect dark world would that be the case. We have only been a vendor for a month now and have had many people finalize either right before they're ready to order more or after 10+ days for no reason. I can only imagine how frustrating it probably is for large vendors. Not necessarily a money thing as much as it is an unprofessional/ disrespect factor for me when members take lengthy finalization times for absolutely no reason.

    I'm not a vendor but I believe a customer shouldn't make a vendor wait anymore than two to three days max if the vendor has 72hrs to ship and order it seems reasonable that a similar timeframe is given to a customer and that great vendors ship faster and good customers will finalize quicker as well

    I think 24-48 hours is about right. You shouldn't expect your vendor to bankroll your supply whether its personal or resale stash.
