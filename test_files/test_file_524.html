    The Don Is back! with a new account but same connections ;) Cocaine, Marijuana (on its way), LSD, and MDMA crystals all up for grabs! Trying to move as quickly as possible. Still waiting on the marijuana. And i probably wont have my new sellers account activated for a week or 2 but you can still contact me at DonCorleone133 on the road. If any vendors need advice on shipping, customs, laws (depending on your country) ill go out of my way to do whatever I can! Thank you guys - Don Corleone

    Sorry, what business? There isn't a business here.

    Fuck off until you have a business and stop spamming the boards with your bullshit. No account, no business, no one is spamming your shit, and you're not running anything by a hype-train.

    <br/>
    Given the recent scam that just ended, I'm actually more likely to think that you are a scammer just the same, hiding behind a name that was at one time well-received. Given that there is no more DonCorleone selling... why is that? Why would a legitimate vendor lose their vending privileges and be unable to get them back? Unless they had been scamming...

    +1 Blargh. Don does sound like a scammer and I think blargh summed it up very nicely.  I will give it to you don though when you said " I got exited when I heard my connect was back".  Because I read it as you intended and I would say that you are close to getting 'exited' once more.  hehe

    Never totally trust reviews on here.  You never know how many accounts someone has and if any of the people are real who say YEAH MAN ITS THE GREATEST SHIT. Just buy small until enough time has gone by with the vendor to see if they BLOW UP with others. Never FE and remember time is on the buyers side. A scammer cant go too long before fucking someone and usually they come here to cry when that happens. LAST RULE search buyers name on here, if some scam messages on them forget it, if they have done it once they will do it again, no such thing as a reformed scammer.
