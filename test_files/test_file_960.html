    From my experience as a vendor I have found that the facts are that 70% of all Americans feel it unnecessary to write the county of residence in there address...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: Well I think my question has been well and truly answered, I understand that the majority of buyers and sellers on the Silk Road are Americans so I guess I will just put up with it and accept that this is the way it is. Thanks for all the good comments and all the others that made this such an interesting debate. didn't expect for this to be such a hot topic and  I think we can safely say we have have seen ever angle of opinion now.

    I'm just messing.  I was actually not born in this country, but it's my home now and it is a part of me!  I don't consider myself anything but a human being.  To try to answer your question, I wouldn't say that Americans consider themselves superior, matter of fact I notice many inferiority complexes walking around daily, but that's everywhere.  The government is strong, and the military is number one, that's undeniable!  The people love their country, but all people love their country.  I am not sure why Americans get this stigma that they think they are the best, my best guess is because they are a top world power, if not still number one.  This of course breeds what Americans call "haters".  As far as addresses, its very simple, they are ignorant.  It's not that they think they are the only country, it's just that they suck at geography and can barely name five foreign countries off the top of their head.  Whats to blame?  There are many factors, one being that they have enjoyed so many luxuries right here in America that its not in their minds to look and explore other countries.  Secondly and this is probably a major part of it, the schools suck.  Geography is probably covered for 20 mins back in grade school!  Hope this shines some light.

    yea you are right, I have no education in geography and cannot name 5 foreign countries. Go te hell, you know nothing about America. Maybe you see this trend because some people do not realize they are ordering from a foreign country. Maybe because many of the things we see are based in the US. For instance, almost any website I use where I must select my country, United States is always first instead of alphabetical order like everything else. Man americans probably just do not think about putting the country because most of them have never mailed anything outside of the United States before.

    Don't take it so personal, both instances are true.  Americans for the most part don't know geography and they rarely have to send a letter internationally.  I'm just speaking from my own experience and there is much truth to it.  I immigrated to the U.S. from a small country and every time I was asked where I was from and answered, generally the response I got was, "where is that"?  When I am asked the same questions by non Americans they almost always immediately know where I am from.  I went through the school system here, I'm not just talking rubbish.  Americans are isolated and don't have the same knowledge about other parts of the world as other parts of the world.  This is not all of them, but sadly the majority that I have known.  I would love to see the school system improve, I am extremely critical of it!  You look at European countries and the kids know more than one language, its a requirement, or maybe just the culture.  I met a group of kids in a Starbucks one time from a Euro country on a class trip, these kids spoke English better than I did!  When I was in school we would be lucky to get a class trip to the local park.  It's ridiculous, the educational system here, I don't believe you can argue that!

    This is exactly the same as traveling Americans. I have never met one that has said America when doing introductions. It's always California or Missouri or whatever state. And I'm thinking "are we just assumed to know where you're from with the state ?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've got nothing wrong with you Americans though. Bloody love your country and travel there all the time.  But please if your traveling in Europe or Thailand don't expect people to know where your from without saying the country

       From my experience as a vendor I have found that the facts are that 70% of all Americans feel it unnecessary to write the county of residence in there address, just wanted to ask you Americans out there, why do you feel so Superior and do you think you are the epicenter of this revolution??? :P

    Yeah English is my first language, however, my finger just slipped(or didn't lol), don't really think it makes me a dumb ass, in fact I really just backs up what I was saying... Anyhow, I am not really having a massive dig, I have known many lovely Americans over the years, just wish I didn't have to Google your addresses to double check, every time I send a package out.

    @Pinkkush - he meant countRy
    <br/>
    @ High Carts - are you a new vendor? If so, welcome. I see you're a little over one month on here. Unless of course you have another forum nic, and use this one to be anonymous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well as an American, who's usually defensive about these things, I'm not offended in the least. I'm sure I've done it by mistake at least once. Otherwise I put USA. - Though I've even seen a vendor profile page that said "None of this USA shit, spell it out!" - That WAS rude, so I simply decided not to give him my business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree with all the points made about most of my fellow countrymen here, no offense taken. There's alot of other shit blamed on us that is false. THIS is not one of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the one thing we should all take away from this? Please fellow Americans, put USA -After your zip-code. Also you all should use the +4 zip code for your address. For those non-Americans, we traditionally used a 7 digit code following the State abbreviation, then some years back (30 to be exact), the postal system introduced an 'add-on' of 4 digits, that helped route mail to the closest post office, thus alleviating some of the sorting process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Very few regular folk bother, as "It still gets there anyway" True. - Though that extra 4 digit code, alleviates most 'human' sorting, which should be of interest to anyone ordering illegal substances through the mail. The +4 gets read by a machine, and it's on it's way. Assuming the vendor hasn't sent it in an odd shaped package.
    <br/>
    Example;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3520 OLD PHILADELPHIA PIKE
    <br/>
    INTERCOURSE PA 17534-7008  USA
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way, ALL CAPS is not necessary, but it is more easily read, with less chance of misreads by the scanner, which also helps avoid the dreaded HUMAN. Particularly the verminous union workers at the US postal service, putting their filthy paws on our packages!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks High Carts, you have done a good service. Don't apologize for it. - There is plenty of shit we Americans are blamed for around the world, that is simply just hatred and jealousy. This, however isn't one of them.  This needed to be brought up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank You.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS - Those Americans still wondering "What's my +4 zip code" - I know you're out there! - Just look at your mail. All utility bills will show your full 7 + 4 digit zip code. - I just know someone reading this is saying. "We don't have that" - YES YOU DO ! ! !
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PPS - Oops! - I had to "edit" this. - I forgot to put USA in my example! LoL! Seriously~! :P

    It's not a matter of international sophistication its a matter of perspective, it used to be the various American States were pretty much countries in their own rights but after the civil war &amp; a century of developing federalism that perceptions changed. American's won't consider anything remarkable in writing to the other end of the USA, but its not that different to writing to the other end of Europe, just need to use a different state name instead of a different country name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Someone in Belgium writing to Poland isn't any more remarkable or unusual than someone from Arkansas writing to Maine (leaving aside language issues) but because of the self-identifications we make as residents of those places &amp; the perception of difference some make inter-country communication to be a bigger thing than it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Size isn't that important in this either. The USA is 3.79m2 while Europe is 3.93m2. To be fair the EU is only 1.67m2 but that's a political construct and doesn't really limit where people correspond to or travel.

    You SHOULD be double checking those addresses anyway, if you're a good vendor. Besides the habitual omission of USA, there could always be a mistake, that had you not checked the address, the letter or package would have gone to the dreaded 'hand sorters'. It only takes one person to fuck it up! BTW-I hope you're using USPS.COM and not Google.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again, I hold no grudge that you point this out, as I myself have done it, only to find the vendor knew enough to think NY might just mean USA. Don't be upset people, if anyone was going to go apeshit over national pride, it would've been me. Right now the biggest insult to the USA is in the White House, and no it's not a racial thing. It's an ideology thing. Though that special coating he has, does act like teflon for all of us who dare to speak his name in vain.

    We don't write the country on our  addresses because we are not used to doing so. There are not very many of us that order things from out of the united states.  Unlike Europe where if you drive fifteen miles your in a new country and people have family in different countries. Here you just change states and we don't have to write anything different on the address if we are sending something to a relative in a different state.  You can call it arrogance if you want but I see it as never having to means not knowing your supposed to.

    Most Americans don't send packages/travel international. In Europe/Asia/SA it's much closer to go to other countries therefore I believe many people are just naive to this and used to doing it this way.

    You know, if you had stated this in a more polite manner, no one would have taken offense and many more would be receptive to the idea. THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF SR is a very new thing for many many people. So instead of being judgmental and insulting, be kind, and suggest it to them via PM. We could all sit around and bitch about what other nationalities do that we are not accustomed to and do not approve of or see reason in. But, then where would that get us?  :-* :-* :-*Lighten up a bit OP.

    Most people from the United States don't ever ship anything outside their borders. So even when they do send a letter or parcel they aren't in the habit of putting the Country underneath the address. I am still guilty of this even though I do use international mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There have been one or two early orders I place at the SR and then an hour later realized that I may have not put my country code at the bottom :( but I have since taken measures to correct that though. And  even "if" I did forget the country, the vendors were gracious enough not to bring it up.

    So on behalf of the Roaders in the States take my humble apology. :)

    I was going to say that the number #1 objective is for SR packages to blend in, so if it isn't typically done for domestic mail, don't do it for domestic SR mail. Here in Canada, I would never put "Canada" on a letter or package traveling domestically, and I ignore domestic vendor instructions (well, I explain) who require otherwise.

    Also, someone in a post above was correct in saying we were not taught to put eh country on our packages. SO when i first ordered from international I made sure to look it up. What helped me to remember t always was it goes from specific to most general.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Name  ( most specific)
    <br/>
    street Adress ( a little less specific but could at least put you in the right location)
    <br/>
    City State zip ( less specific but puts you in a largely asccosiated are)
    <br/>
    Country (most specific)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bet if we felt like we could be continent but that would be utterly useless, or maybe the mail wouldnt even read it or just get super confused.

    The OP hasn't been back on this thread since day 1. He's a noob vendor. 1 whole month selling poppy seeds, pods for tea, one listing for a gram of something called UK Cheese that appears to be pot.

    Kind of unethical IMHO.

    Amazing.
    <br/>

    On second thought this actually is a deliberate put down of Americans. - The "why do you feel so Superior" part (capital S where it shouldn't be), just says to me he's just another limey America hater. The point about putting USA after your address, is just an excuse to bash us.

    Good luck with your bad ass vendor page and your scary opium seeds and pods. Which by the way, can be purchased mail order right here in the states.

    We don't need Silk Road for that.

    I'm from America and went to public schools. At least in my school, we definitely learned how to write addresses both domestically and internationally. They asked us all to pick a country from a list, and then we had to send a letter to government organizations in that country asking for them to send information about tourist spots, etc. I don't know how many school districts require this to be taught but it should be mandatory to learn it everywhere if you ask me.

    A lot of places in USA, Canada and Australia were named after United Kingdom areas, meaning if you forget the country and a UK vendor doesn't notice then your order instead of going across the sea it has a nice short trip to the area in the UK it is named after before being marked "Unknown address" or the like.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In reply to Jagfuq, 70% is exaggerating but we can say as a top 10% vendor the amount of Americans who do this is a lot more than other countries. That said there are plenty of Americans who do put their country but you don't remember the good customers as much because you spend less time dealing with them.

    When placing an order on SR there is explicitly mentioned to put the address in the box exactly as it shall appear on the label. It is clearly the buyers responsibility to give his correct AND complete address.

    If i wouldn't check every  single address and correct them when necessary, many orders would either not arrive at all  or with delay. I have to search addresses in Google again and again and mostly it's Americans that are wasting my time this way.

    education I guess. Most Americans rarely leave the country in their lives so why would they know, to their defence ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am worldly enough to pick their zip codes / state abbreviations when they leave them out. goes both ways IMO

    And since we are talking about proper addressing of letters and packages, many of us Americans could do ourselves a favor as a previous member said, and get the proper ZIP+4 code for our address, which, like they said, enables automatic sorting and therefore draws less attention to our parcels. The website for accomplishing this is:

    I don't know if that's really fair to our American cousins.  The vast majority of us rarely send stuff abroad and it's easy to forget to put your country if the majority of your dealings are internal. I suspect the number of them only seems large because they're the biggest group here on SR.

     States in our country(USA) are the same size, if not bigger than your countries in Europe.

     I think it's fair when we introduce ourselves to say what state we're from. Plus, I would think by now one could easily assume someone from America, IS from America. Maybe you might confuse us with Canadians... but an easy way to tell us apart is by the size of our penises.

    It's ok, if you look at yourself in the mirror you will see it's not as small as you think it is Festivalia.

    Sure, it's not Canadian, but it will equal six inches if you go in and out a few times.

    If you were from Germany, you would say you were from Germany because that's your country.  European countries have states/provinces too.  The only foreign countries you can really get away with just saying your state and expecting someone to have a clue is Canada or Mexico.  Just like you probably don't know how the first world war started, Europeans probably don't know anything about the American revolution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The UK is even weirder - instead of poivinces/states they have countries, like Wales, England, Scotland, etc. and then I think they subdivide again by county, like Nottingham and Blaconsfield.
    <br/>
    Please correct me if I'm wrong UK'ers.
    <br/>

    Op could have worded it nicer, but I understand his frustration.   The point is that as customers, American or whoever, your responsibility is to provide your correct address.  It is not up to the vendor to hunt down your address details.  Making assumptions is wrong for both customer and vendor, as place names can be similar internationally.
    <br/>
    If you're so busy that it's an inconvenience to message the individual for clarification, it would be better to put something in your vendor page saying incorrectly addressed orders will be cancelled without notice, or you are not responsible for lost items due to incorrect addressing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pissed-off folks, answering the ops mild ignorance with greater ignorance doesn't help your case, or peoples opinions of North Americans. (Canadians are almost always treated/mistaken as Americans overseas, and we make a lot of your TV shows)  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Speaking of TV, I think the media has a lot to do with this argument.  Anyone from outside watching your movies and shows and think Americans love their country so much, they will embrace ignorance in life and chant USA at the drop of a hat like a living Homer Simpson.  Ignorance is not a good excuse for anything, though it does explain.  Americans think everyone outside the US hates them and secretly want to live there.
    <br/>
    Newsflash: we all love our own homelands (for the most part) because that's who we identify with, and there is a mix of people in every country that make it good and bad depending on where you are and who you're with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I LOVE our world, North America really has it going on for a safe, pleasant living experience.  Europe is not far behind, and in some areas is ahead of us (health and child care).
    <br/>
    We need to identify what we love about other Countries and try to incorporate that into our lives.
    <br/>
    Like the siesta.  North America could stand a nap in the afternoon.  Hell, and a four-day work week.
    <br/>
    Japan was kicking our ass in the 80's and 90's economically, but their suicide rate went through the roof because of stress, we don't need to be more industrious, we need to work harder globally at making people in general happier.
    <br/>
    That's how you fight terror and discontent, and this is how you get high and ramble-on for ten minutes.

    That is some good info for all buyers to be aware of. Also to answer OP's question, it's because most Americans are extremely ignorant.
