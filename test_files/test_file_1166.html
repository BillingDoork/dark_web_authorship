    everyone knows the uk customs are regarded as some what of a joke compared to other countries, i heard theres a lot more items getting caught is that true? are they really catching up? just curious hopefully not! the easier the better would hate it to turn into another Australia! saying that i've managed to get stuff to Aus easy enough using metal based packing

    Wheres the evidence to suggest more items are getting caught? You heard it where?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you say forums you heard it, then perhaps it could be increase of users joining forum and sharing their experience rather than customs getting any better? If SR users aren't on forums then we know little about seizures except from your own experiences really.

    Stick to rule one and make sure the vendor is up to scratch in terms of quality of stealth, then quality of product. Never be too complacent with UK customs, they aren't exactly the best, but they aint the worst either. Always do your research!

    even if you order off the best guy off here it has high chances of getting caught if its outside EU
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i suggest stick to EU and you should be fine iv received some awfully packaged bulk (100g+) from Europe several times and then i tried a couple times outside EU and 3rd time it got caught, this was over half a year ago though since then i dont order across the border so security could have tightened up considering they know what their up against but id suggest avoid ordering stuff around holiday season as security is at its best
