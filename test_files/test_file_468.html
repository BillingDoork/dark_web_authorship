    The title says it all
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone receive an item that the USPS site never updated with the DCN
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's been two days since mailing with no updates, tomorrow should be the date of arrival but the USPS DCN has not updated once or has it recognized any tracking. My past two transaction occurred recently and both DCN worked fine and it actually "tracked" at each postal service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am starting to get worried that I may be lied to from my vendor and package was just never sent because seriously any random number would generate the same message.

    Yes this happens all the time, basically some employees don't scan the barcode and just throw it in the bin. I've had orders go from "electronic info received" to "delivered" nothing in between.

    BUT why would they scanned the last two shipments (one last week, one two weeks ago) and now scan now?
