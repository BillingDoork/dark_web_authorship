    Ok, so I sent a package to a customer just over a week ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While checking up on the DCN, it got a "missent" message on the status column. I looked up what "missent" meant according to USPS, and it is a screw-up on their end- they mis-routed it somewhere along the way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I didn't think a thing about it and figured they would just get it sent to the right place and I would have my btc for the order when SR got back up...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It appears the package is coming BACK my way. The state it was going to wasn't too far from the state from where it was being shipped. The last sort facility it went through wasn't the exact city from where it was shipped.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my question is- is this normal practice? Idk how far away it was from it's destination zip code, but doesn't seem like they would ship it ALL the way back to the sending state just to re-ship it back out to the receiving state... Unless it makes sense logistically to do so because of how the interstates run.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think? There's no way for me to get the package back as I didn't use a real PO Box, well it was a real one but not one I have access to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As of right now, it's basically looking like the person who owns the PO Box is going to get a surprise, right? If so, hopefully he they keep them for themselves instead of calling LE  :o.

    I've seen this, but with a legal package... it was supposed to go from California to New York, it went from California to Pennsylvania back to California and the original sort facility then to New York. USPS isn't efficient, they won't reroute your package to the correct state - it's easier for them to resend it back to point of origin to have them resend to the right location.  Sucks, but everything should turn out fine. :)

    I've had this happen before...normally they fix the problem really fast and I will receive the package only a day late but sometimes it can take a few days going back and forth before it gets to where it's going.

    It is not a big deal at all. Your package got placed (likely by a random machine on a conveyor belt) into the wrong bin and was sent to the wrong shipping center. There are hubs that you package moves through on its way to you. They sent it to the wrong one, realized it, and then sent it back. Simple. Nothing suspicious. Happens all the time.

    Anything out of the ordinary is suspicious.  Sometimes it happens that packages get misrouted, so it could just be a mistake.  Sounds like nothing links you to the return address.  I would change up return addresses in that case, as your returns are not retrievable anyhow.  If the package gets through to the recipient then it was not intercepted.

      It means the post office missent it to the wrong postal facility and they are routing it back where it has to go.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Its different then undeliverable as addresses, which is a senders issue.

     Yeah, I can confirm this for ya my friend. I had several express packages domestically that showed that same thing. What happened, after some very paranoid investigation, was that my package was simply thrown in the wrong sorting bin and left in the wrong truck. Therefore, if the sort facility it ends up in due to that employee's mistake is not the one that should have been in succession, the package has to be rerouted to the facility where the mistake was made (this makes no sense to me, but anywho) and then is on the correct path. I can say if you call from a safe number and bitch about it (especially if it's express and guaranteed; you kinda have em by the short hairs if they don't meet the deadline and you acknowledge it). You have nothing to worry about most likely my friend. I can see there being mistakes with the mail as busy as I'm sure it is.
