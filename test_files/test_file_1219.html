    I'm thinking about becoming a vendor and have mostly everything figured out except for the return address on the packages. Any thoughts or suggestions on what would be the best way to go about finding a legit return address would be much appreciated.

    Hey Dan,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Business return addresses for a REAL business in the SAME or CLOSE BY zip code to where you are dropping your packages off are best. Look for something smaller that won't already have 10,000 packages going through the mail system and find one that sells a consumer product that seems normal to be in the mail. There are way more of these than you might expect, you just have to do a little digging. The best advice we ever got was that there is no "one" right return address but rather one that is best for your area. Think about where the package will be sent from, what is likely to be shipped from there?  Best of luck!

    I do exactly what the poster above me said. I find businesses that are close by to whichever mail drop box I am going to use and I print the businesses return address out to the shipping label usually even adding the the exact businesses whose address I am "borrowing's" logo to make it look EXACTLY like a business letter :) Switch up which return address you chose to use frequently, if you ever find out that a package you did sent did not arrive never use the return address that was on that package ever again because if it was not seized it most likely would be "returned to sender" so the usiness could have a letter returned to them that they recognize they never sent, open it and find the contraband and call the law.  NEVER hand write your labels, always use professional using shipping labels to make your letter look identical to all the other MILLIONS upon millions of business letter mail going through the system daily. NEVER use a residence for a return address, always make it a legitimate business address so it looks like a business is sending mail to a client and does not look like someone is simply sending a friend or family member a letter because who seriously using the postal system to communicate these days other then businesses sending clients things....With email and everything else no one simply uses the post to mail a letter to their friend so you gotta make your letter look as business type as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It might seem hard at first, but once you play around you'll get it mastered. I have a HUGE list of businesses whose addresses I use for return addresses and I make the letter look exactly like it would like if the business sent it with their logo and everything. Just use smaller businesses though that wouldn't be having so much mail sent out that they would have prepaid business envelopes from the post office that don't require stamps plus if you use a company say like rogers cell phone company, firstly it is impossible because they have a business account with the post office and secondly customs would see TONS of their letters daily so if one looked out of place they may notice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope I was some help brother :) I have been in the letter mail order contraband business for a VERY long time and as long as you get your letters to look, feel and of course smell just like the millions of other envelopes it is very easy to get through any border, just takes a little practice ;) simple envelopes are pretty much NEVER x-rayed or searched so yeah....Once you get your packaging down you'll be good my man :)

    If you must use a residential address, make it appear as a home based business. Lots of this type of mail goes through the system daily. If it gets RTS because someone gave to a bad drop address, the recipient likely won't go through the trouble of calling the law. And depending on what you sell, might feel so lucky and happy that they'll go out and play the lotto that very day. ;)

    If you can, get your hands on official envelopes/letterhead taken directly from nearby businesses/institutions.

    Well, you have the hardest stuff figured out.  This is the easiest part and has already been answered above. :)
