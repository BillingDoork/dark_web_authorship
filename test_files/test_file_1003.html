    French and German researchers started a new project called InPoSec; they're trying to find a way to use the airport security body scanners for finding bombs and illicit items in letters and packets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So far i was only able to find german and french news about this, but there are some english links in the article:
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know if there's any way to block those rays. Does anyone know more about this project?

    These systems are a bad idea. They make the system more fragile and prone to stoppage, not stronger and more resilient.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bombs in the mail are exceedingly rare, virtually unheard of where I'm from, I don't see the benefits exceeding the costs. If someone here is worried about bombs in the mail, their paranoia (or exaggerated fear of loss of power) is what requires treatment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What happens when someone's stinky and leaky cannabis shipment (or other shipment?) gets residue all over the other mail sent in the same containers?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One firecracker's residue on a package will rub against how many other packages and give how many false positives for explosives along the process? The postal workers themselves would end up tagging packages and letters from their handling of other packets.

    It would be insanity. I know there is no way the USPS will be doing anything like this anytime soon. They are broke as fuck and in debt.

    This won't happen. They use x-rays in the milder end of the spectrum and can damage electrical equipment as well as photographical equipment, certain everyday chemicals and other things. It's just a whole world of law suits waiting to happen.
