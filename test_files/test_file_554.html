    Being in Aus I realize that it take more time to receive a package. That being said I ordered and on the 17th of December packages were dispatched from NL and Germany and still haven't arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every day I have been eagerly awaiting the mail, only to be disappointed every time. Although I am out of pocket almost 1K, I am thinking that perhaps it is just better to give up on expecting to receive it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I haven't asked for a tracking number yet. Should I?

    Im in the same boat and close to the same dollar amount but with many vendors, some are running over a month now and i think i can say goodby to those orders..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is only the first week of the new year with lots of holidays so you are def still in with a chance, id hang out atleast a month before asking for track no. or refund...

    Yeah, mine is multiple packages too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Actually I still hold high hopes for Monday, but I dread feeling disappointed again. I haven't had real MDMA in 10 years.

    Seems to be a lot of packages going missing lately.  Perhaps this excellent thread started by TheYowie is relevant?... or perhaps the recent spike in volume of SR 'mail' means it just seems like more is going missing, when in fact the percentages may be the same as they were a year ago?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way I think this is good reading:

    Though 3 of my 4 orders during December arrived, the one I most wanted did not... and it does suck waiting for that freakin postie EVERY DAY!  I think BoganBob is right though, I would allow at least one month before I wrote it off, but if no sign by then I reckon it's gone.
