    New vendor. Shipped first package (nothing inherently illegal inside) last weekend. Should have been picked up Tuesday. Hasn't arrived yet, and destination is not too far away. Domestic. Wondering if Priority is just running slow because of the holiday Monday or if I screwed up my procedure somehow?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I use prepaid priority envelopes with DCNs. I put the DCN on the envelope and just drop in a box on the corner. Is there anything wrong with that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And the first package I sent shows nothing when I look up DCN. But a second package, sent a few days later, shows being sorted through a local sort facility. What gives?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Surely the very first package I send as a vendor isn't lost hehheh At least I hope not. Any help appreciated! Thanks guys!
