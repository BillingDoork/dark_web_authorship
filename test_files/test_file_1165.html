    I am going to an event in a few weeks in Vegas. I am staying at a nice hotel on the strip. I have successfully shipped myself drugs to other locations the last one being to a Miami hotel. I called them and made an excuse to have something mailed to me, it was a small amount maybe 4g max and shipped it USPS overnight to my hotel. Everything made it well, it was double vacuum sealed and pretty much flat in an envelope and then thrown into an express package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am going to be doing this again and it will around a 5-6g package double vac'd and with nice stealth will be doing Overnight shipping again through USPS and have my sister mail it off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated and if you have done this already let me know how it went. I do not want to risk carrying it on me, on the plane.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Hey Joker,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Isn't the phrase anything goes in Vegas? You wouldn't happen to be going to EDC would you :-D Anyways I've mailed to Vegas before (one of the biggest, most popular hotels there) and it was fine. Just follow the same rules you always would for mailing. Maybe disguising the envelope as tickets to something? I'd imagine/know people often get their tickets express mailed to them when they can't afford the 2-3 days priority takes. Printed labels are always a plus ;-)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PM me if you have any direct questions, I'd be more than happy to help any way I can.

    successfully express-posted 0.5.g of black-tar heroin to a small hotel in california, no problem.

    You're visiting on business and you forgot an important letter. Your secretary is sending mailing it to you. Totally plausible and normal.
