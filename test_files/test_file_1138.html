    Just wondering a little bit here, it is suggested in other topics that its best to have the letter as flat as possible and for it not to be felt by hand thus the product inside the mail is in stealth. By the way I am not asking for suggestions on shipping techniques regarding stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll give you an example, which of the two would you rather buy, bud that's in its original form, like nice and fluffy or the exact same thing but crushed, or pure cocaine off chipped off the block or the exact same thing put powdered up? I know the answer, just want to know if others here agree with me...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ultimately, if the products you want to start selling come in the shape/form as they should be, as we know them and expect them to be, would a first impression of doubt build up when the buyer receives it? Although it is the same product as advertised in the image and description, and something different appears in the buyers mail then he may build a instant perception of not what I paid for? Am I right or am I wrong?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ultimately, although this will improve stealth and chances of arrival are pretty high up there, whats stops the buyer from taking a case to resolution and claiming not what is advertised on the picture?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could be wrong in what I'm saying however I tend to have my doubts cleared first and then search for the next solution...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any inputs will be greatly appreciated!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers

    Everyone wants stuff that's sold as close to the source as possible, with the best potency, flavour and appearance.
    <br/>
    The picture is usually representative of what you will get.  If I see a pic of a block of coke and I'm ordering a gram, I don't expect a chunk of coke though, I expect some finely ground powder.
    <br/>
    Some people have had problems in the past with "crushed bud" here on the road.  Generally if the product is decent and makes it to the customer, SR is on the vendors side.  I've never seen SR step in to help one of those crushed bud guys.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Appearance I think should make the difference between a good vendor and a great vendor, but I think appearance alone should not dictate if someone is a bad vendor or not - unless it appears someone layed a big duke on your order before they packaged it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I think the pic should be representative of what you get, and if they don't have one then they should leave it blank instead of stealing a mis-representative pic elsewhere.

    @AfternoonDelight yes pal no doubt the customer exactly what is shown, and the quality described, however you hit the spot when you said the crushed bud, whatever it is that im suggesting, to achieve maximum stealth you need to alter its shape or form, the only thing I'm afraid of, is that people in general build a perception of something by first impression. So if people see a nice block of pure cocaine on the picture, and yes that's it will be, the picture will be signed watermarked, one from having it stolen by potential scammers and to validate a vendors authenticity, so I agree with you here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another reason why I mention this, is that people in certain countries have a perception of the absolute real and purest form of product can never make it to their country. For example, with cocaine is in SouthAm, with pills and MDMA its, NL, however not true, but try convincing some buyers who perhaps are a little ignorant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In conclusion, whatever product I may/may not decide to bring to SR it will be exactly as whats advertised, just to achieve maximum stealth, it may be flattened, so ultimately what I'm getting at is
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would flattening a product or crushing it be a problem to SR buyers?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this is a problem, I guess it time to get to work to discover other stealth techniques.
