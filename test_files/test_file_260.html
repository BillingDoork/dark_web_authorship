    Are any Aussies receiving their tracked items with a "scanned" stamp on it? i have had 3 items come in the mail and only one was from SR.
    <br/>
    they were all scanned by customs and let through even though the SR one were tablets in the blister pack.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my question is will all tracked items get scanned through customs?
    <br/>
    i was thinking of making a largish order so i dont run out over the holidays but am worried because large orders mostly get sent with tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if i ask the vendor do send with no tracking they will think im trying to scam them.
    <br/>
    What To Do?

    Just PM the vendor in question. They will most probably have a refund policy relating to items without "tracked" shipping. There is always a risk, especially without tracking, and it is also dependent on your buying stats of course. At least tracking can help should a dispute arise but I'd just ask the vendor on their policy and go from there. :)

    i got the item no problem, they left a letter for me to pick up from the Post Office, it wasn't anything major just a couple of cialis but it could have been worse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i have to tell all vendors not to send tracked but im hping they dont think im trying to scam and i dont really want to FE
