    I've been expecting a couple packages internationally. One of them arrived, but the other one hasn't yet showed. I couldn't figure out how to check tracking initially, but I finally figured out how to check the tracking on the packages and it's saying that both packages arrived at the unit. Does this ABSOLUTELY mean that the package was delivered to the box? Is it possible that it's sitting at the post office right now? If I call the post office and give them the reference number will they check if it's there for me?

    Dude I don't want to upset you but you should prepare for a raid (provided you ordered something illegal). Get ALL illegal stuff out of your house NOW and wait until the package situation is resolved. Also securely erase your browser history (tracking site).

    There's a chance the package was too big for your P.O. Box. In that the Post Office holds it in the back.

    I was in this same situation once and it turned out that they just forgot to put the slip into my box.Â  The agonizing part is that the larger the order, the more you want to go get it, but the more fucked you'll be if things go bad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could always call the post office from a phone not linked to you, if the order is large enough to justify that.

    Tbh i think this is terrible advice, unless it was a massive amount of something, then they would've gone straight there. They only really stay back if they want to prove you bought some big orders.

    I would call the post office and check if its there, tthey fuck stuff up all the time.

    I don't know which country he's in but here in Germany it takes the cops ages to obtain a search warrant for small amounts of contraband and a delayed package with the tracking site saying that it arrived and post office staff not knowing anything are pretty much always "symptoms" of a seized package.

     Here in the UK they come fairly quick, and usually leave you alone for a couple of grams. But even if it is a massive operation worth thousands they dont carry guns :P (Even if you have to buy a new door)

    I got one of those slips in my mail box one time. It was terrible, the box had a stamp on it that said 'received damaged' and there was a huge hole in the box, I mean huge, and you could see everything in the package through the hole. When they handed me the box and I saw the hole and the stamp I thought I was gonna be sleeping on concrete and eating beans and toast for 72 hours.
