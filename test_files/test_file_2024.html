    I am a dog walker and have access to about 20 different addresses to make a long story short. When I place my orders, I will use the same address maybe two-three times.  I keep an excel spreadsheet going, it's all organized and then I move down the list, all the while knowing who will be where.  Anyhow, it's a good thing for ordering stuff on SR as most people don't come home from work till after 5pm and most mail is delivered way before then.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I'm having a problem with are sellers who don't think it's important to communicate when in the F'+%$ stuff will show up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We need to all keep on top of this.  Sellers, us buyers are in many cases just as sophisticated as you are and we have just as much to lose.  Silkroad, if we can somehow express to sellers that letting their buyers know when the package was shipped and who it is coming from (who cares what the fictitious name is) this can be most helpful.  I even have a few addresses where I need to know who the 'senders" name is on the from envelope because I'm using my real name and having it sent to a friends place so I need to let me friend know who it's coming from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I appreciate it very much if sellers can take this more serious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, don't get me wrong, I always use PGP and I like to keep my communications between a buyer and seller to a minimum.  This morning was simply the last straw.
    <br/>
    I was like, OK, it has now been 5 days since it was shipped, and great an order worth a substantial amount of money is showing up when?  If it's Friday, no problem.  But if it's Sat, then WTF am I going to do?  I'll think of something I'm sure, but I don't need that sort of stress.  Anyhow, I did express to the seller that I needed to know when my order was arriving (he said Tues. / Thurs. at the latest of this week)but evidently it's not important and I'm just an anal retentive dork with nothing else to do but wait for my packages because I'm an idiot, and I ordered using my real name and address (not). It's a two way street here is all I'm saying and I doubt that most people use their own name and address very often, so sellers have to step a little.  We have to remember that people are receiving illegal substances and we buyers need to protect our asses as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please pardon the rant but I needed to get this off my chest.  We really have to respect the buyers just as much as the sellers.

    Thanks for lending your ears,
