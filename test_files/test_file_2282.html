    Because of the packaging of our most recent purchase from the SR I believe our address may now be flagged by the USPS.  This was an order for 7 diet pills.  What arrived was a torn, crumpled plain envelope which had been placed in the standard Postmaster General, "Sorry We Tore Your Mail" envelope and there sat one of the pills, front and center, in the clear window for everyone's viewing pleasure.  It ALSO had an Insufficient Postage stamp on front.   The return address was a personal one.  Needless to say, we were shocked and very scared.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This vendor must have been hard up for cash as he had used whatever was around the house to protect and hide the pills in a "stealthy" manner.  NOT!!  In this case, it was something he must have found in the bottom of ...edited.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of the 7 pills ordered, only 3 arrived so we wonder if 4 are now being held by the USPS, or were handed off to the Feds for analysis.  When I tried to find out from the vendor exactly what the pills contained, just to get an idea what we are up against and the possible legal ramifications, he was evasive.  He claimed that there was nothing to worry about in them.  When I persisted, he gave me the  name of a medication I could not verify anywhere on the web.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We are scared, very scared.  We have rented a storage unit and placed everything we own which could be considered even remotely illegal.  We are not ordering anything on the SR now and possibly ever, all thanks to this sloppy, cheap vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unfortunately we had one other order in transit before all this came down and I am wondering if I need to "return to sender" for my own safety and to make it look like I most assuredly do not accept mail from anyone or any company I am unfamiliar with.  I really would like this package as it has mushrooms which I use to medicate my migraines.  What do you all think?  Am I being overly paranoid?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the defense of this vendor, he tried to make it right by offering to re-send the pills.  I said, thanks but no thanks, finalized the order and gave him a 1 rating and explained why in the review.

    reason: detailed description of packaging     (not that I agree with the method or incorrect postage which is a sin)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also your pills are nowhere you should be concerned. Believe me those few diet pills are not worth fretting over, more than likely they ended up on a sorting floor somewhere and nobody knew where they came from.
    <br/>
    So you ordered pills that you didnt know what they were? If you PM me the name of the pill I will clean up a few issues for you.
    <br/>
    rental storage overkill. It sounds like you might have a PO box. You might want to change the box and the name on it, but even that is really overkill.

    if your stuff made it and the police didn't raid your house, you're fine.
    <br/>
    if it was flagged, it wouldn't come.
    <br/>
    if LE knew they would try to pop that ass hole.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    [good move cleaning your house out, but you should be safe to get your other package. just don't sign for it if you are asked to.]

     You know what though?  They looked like some kind of mineral supplement in a clear gelcap.  No pharmaceutical logo or anything.  When the person who lives with me dropped the envelope down in front of me [he actually was the one who ordered the "7 diet pills,"] I was on my cell at the time and didn't even skip a beat, stop talking or really notice that damn pill front and center other than to say to myself, "now who the hell is sending us mineral pills?"

      haha.. or they looked them up on their cell phones and realized they were just diet pills...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      You know what though?  They looked like some kind of mineral supplement in a clear gelcap.  No pharmaceutical logo or anything.  When the person who lives with me dropped the envelope down in front of me [he actually was the one who ordered the "7 diet pills,"] I was on my cell at the time and didn't even skip a beat, stop talking or really notice that damn pill front and center other than to say to myself, "now who the hell is sending us mineral pills?"

    oh, and a little trick on your Quotes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    always post after the [/quote][/quote] and what not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    that way, like this one, your post doesn't get added into the Quotation. :)
    <br/>
    just a friendly tidbit.

    hope all is well.

    :oI found this packaging to be very stealthy I got the same diet pills and they were.... I asked what was in the pills and he gave me the ingredient right away.

    never sign for shit. the diet pills have been held up with customs and released. the active ingredient is not even a drug to be tested for, you are worrying to much.

     Because of the packaging of our most recent purchase from the SR I believe our address may now be flagged by the USPS.  This was an order for 7 diet pills.  What arrived was a torn, crumpled plain envelope which had been placed in the standard Postmaster General, "Sorry We Tore Your Mail" envelope and there sat one of the pills, front and center, in the clear window for everyone's viewing pleasure.  It ALSO had an Insufficient Postage stamp on front.   The return address was a personal one.  Needless to say, we were shocked and very scared.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This vendor must have been hard up for cash as he had used whatever was around the house to protect and hide the pills in a "stealthy" manner.  NOT!!  In this case, it was something he must have found in the bottom of ...edited.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Of the 7 pills ordered, only 3 arrived so we wonder if 4 are now being held by the USPS, or were handed off to the Feds for analysis.  When I tried to find out from the vendor exactly what the pills contained, just to get an idea what we are up against and the possible legal ramifications, he was evasive.  He claimed that there was nothing to worry about in them.  When I persisted, he gave me the  name of a medication I could not verify anywhere on the web.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We are scared, very scared.  We have rented a storage unit and placed everything we own which could be considered even remotely illegal.  We are not ordering anything on the SR now and possibly ever, all thanks to this sloppy, cheap vendor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unfortunately we had one other order in transit before all this came down and I am wondering if I need to "return to sender" for my own safety and to make it look like I most assuredly do not accept mail from anyone or any company I am unfamiliar with.  I really would like this package as it has mushrooms which I use to medicate my migraines.  What do you all think?  Am I being overly paranoid?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the defense of this vendor, he tried to make it right by offering to re-send the pills.  I said, thanks but no thanks, finalized the order and gave him a 1 rating and explained why in the review.

     reason: detailed description of packaging     (not that I agree with the method or incorrect postage which is a sin)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also your pills are nowhere you should be concerned. Believe me those few diet pills are not worth fretting over, more than likely they ended up on a sorting floor somewhere and nobody knew where they came from.
     <br/>
     So you ordered pills that you didnt know what they were? If you PM me the name of the pill I will clean up a few issues for you.
     <br/>
     rental storage overkill. It sounds like you might have a PO box. You might want to change the box and the name on it, but even that is really overkill.

    What is it that I did wrong exactly as far as detailed description of packaging?  Should I not have described the shoddy methods of this vendor in such detail and if so which details should I have left out.  Well, right, you can't say that here but you know what I mean.  I am just wondering how that would invade someone's privacy.  I am sure there is a valid reason, I am just not grasping it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the vendor he/she is:  qd8714  in case folks did not catch that in one of my replies.  I wasn't replying correctly and my answers were in the quote boxes.  Hope I got it right this time.

    Apologize for the delay in responding but I hid under a rock for a while.  Nice to be out and about again!!
