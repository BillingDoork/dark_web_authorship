    I know someone waiting for a letter from a country that is notorious for stealing mail. He says that in that country, upto 15% of packages are stolen by postman..
    <br/>
    If the package was sent via tracking with a tracking number, is it less likely to be stolen or does that not make any difference?

    I'd assume less likely as it is more possible to be held accountable for as a post man when it is tracked? Then again, in he is taking 15% of packages we doubt he is giving too much of a shit if it's a tracked package or not. Something about that doesn't seem correct. Care to share more about the situation?

    Well I'm waiting for a letter from Poland. I found a thread about wives who send care packages to their husbands on the military base in Poland and vice versa and it says on the rhread that up to 15% of packages are stolen by theiving postal workers (i can link you the thread if ur interested).
    <br/>
    I happen to be waiting for a SR package from Poland and its a tracked package. Its been over 2 weeks and i'm starting to think that maybe someone stole it. So i was wondering if my package is less likely or more likely to get stolen if its tracked (since if its stolen someone is held accountable for it bec of the rracking)?

    I dont think it really matters if its tracked or not, If a postal worker or who ever want it then their gonna take it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv waited 14 days for Poland mail before, then other times its only been 7 days. So it could depend on when the vendor really sent your parcel and also if its not a regular letter size it could be in customs waiting clearance.

    Well, if it's tracked, can't you just look it up and see where it is?

    Hey bud,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the additional info. It is definitely interesting that this would be the case. I have thought on it though and decided it is probably just you feeling a bit anxious that your package hasn't showed yet. There are many things that were more likely to have happened to your package though, at least in my opinion. It could have been miss sorted or perhaps it could have been delayed in getting sent (by post or vendor). At any rate, I'm not sure it is more or less likely to get taken by a postal worker if it has tracking or not. My best advice is to sit tight and have some faith, likely it will show up any day now. Note that some orders going through customs can take a month or longer to receive. It's all part of the game. PM me if you have any other questions you don't want posted publicly, I don't mind giving you a second opinion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best,
