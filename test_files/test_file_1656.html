    Hey
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been reading that Customs all across the world are doing a crackdown on Drugs via mail. There is a 50 % Rating that UK mail will be delivered.
    <br/>
    Some one said that they have some type of new scanner? UK customs have been finding SR mail every single day! UK customs have caught so many letters that they know what to look for. Please can any one update me on this. Please say that im wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Warning!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have ordered of Silk Road and not received your drugs. There is a good chance that RM have it. If you get a letter through the door saying there is a Letter/Parcel in your local Post Office ready to be picked up. Do not do it if you know 100% its your SR stuff. A friend of mine got a letter from RM saying there is a letter at your local post office. He knew it was his SR letter and he went to pick it up. As he sighed for it and went to walk out the door. The police got him :(.
    <br/>
    Please all be careful

    I can certainly agree that there has been a serious increase in non-deliveries FROM the UK to a neighbouring EU country. No notifications or customs notices on the receiving end, but rather just non-deliveries, even from previously reputable sources, making me believe that there is further scanning within the UK.

    Further scanning orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.............. just more people jumping on the scam bandwagon (the customs have got my package, look everyone said so, I promise I am an honest buyer)

    <br/>
    and getting nicked at the post office by cops that are waiting to arrest. wtf? you think the cops have nothing better to do than wait at a post office for some junkie to pick up his stash? ..for a fucking personal charge. for all the pigs know the guy might not turn up for days. like they're gonna hang about there that long for that.

    As stupid as this story is and in no doubt theres no crackdown at the moment, there isnt the manpower or money to really change much, my friend did get busted through the post. He was receiving about an oz a week in dog food and after a few months he got raided, they stated the packet ripped open and the weed fell out, even though it was triple layered. He got raided and they found about half and some scales in his house, was really pathetic and they tried to scare him. Didnt work of course. community service order.

    I believe this clampdown rumour came about due to the correlation of the internal uk clampdown on liquids in the post, the introduction of a new scanning system for international ( liquid ) and a massive overhaul of the internal postcode reading system for uk mail.
    <br/>
    I am pretty damn certain on this.
    <br/>
    I am also pretty damn certain on purple kush so there is the smallest chance im wrong.
