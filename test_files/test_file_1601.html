    Good morning,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I tried to search this in the sticky posts, unfortunately I only read a few dozen pages rather than hundreds. Also the search engine did not provide me with a definitive answer. So I apologize in advance if this is a redudent question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know the gold standard for return address is a business. Is it better to use a small business or do vendors usually create a business with a real address that may be a house a few blocks away? Also, if anyone has knowledge of how you eventually get a seller rating number beside your name? I am guessing after so many X transactions.
    <br/>

    Thank you in advance. Selling Dexedrine 5mg IR to Canada/USA. I started becoming a vendor because I was unhappy to see this product being sold for $10/tab when there was only a few sellers distributing this. Anyone who helps me with this and decides to order from me I will add 10% extra product in your order just mention this post in your purchasing note.

    Here is the explination on stats from the wiki (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Feedback_Score)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In order for a vendor's rating to appear next to their name, they must be reviewed enough for it to be a meaningful average. This requires roughly 10 reviews per month, but can be more or less depending of the weights of the reviews.

    From a few things I read here, it is a very good idea to make the return address in the same postal code as where you are making the drop.  It has been suggested by some that packages with postal codes different from where they were collected could be looked at more closely.  Add to this the fact that every single piece of mail is photographed before it is processed could help with identifying abnormalities such as this

    I may have not made my question clear enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering moreso if you were to use a business return address. Do many vendors just make up a business name like say "Future Tech" and add the address of say a house/store that does not belong to that name... or do they use a real small business?

    Just type in on startpage, "Colorado business directory" Or where ever you want your address to be from. Choose a small business and there you go :) change it often.
