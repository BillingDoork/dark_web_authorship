    Hi,
    <br/>
    I'm new here. Just made couple of international orders that haven't arrive yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wondering if the package supposed to be found in the mail-box ... OR, do we get a knock on the door to get it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they come to our doors, what happens if I was not there?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do I have to go to the post office to collect it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    umm .. what shall I say to them?  :o

    If you need to ask questions like that what  are you doing using tor or s r  to start with, you should know all this

    before even thinking of placing any order.

    Another cringeworthy Aus thread by an uneducated buyer. This is starting to get quite embarrassing -_-
    <br/>
    Why on earth would you order DRUGS from another country when you seem to have no fucking idea about how it is being delivered to you. What the fuck are you people thinking?!?!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can't spend time to learn from the wealth of knowledge on the forum don't bother posting useless threads like this. I am normally one to always offer help when I can, but this is just ridiculous. You certainly don't belong on SR and you certainly should not be ordering multiple packages for your first order. This community is about helping people who help themselves, as well as harm reduction amongst other things. In terms of harm reduction, I highly suggest you delete TOR and uproot your mailbox from the ground and wedge it somewhere else, far far far from your house. Any packages that do arrive in that particular mailbox should be taken to the local tip, or buried deep underground, because if you don't know how post arrives you certainly don't know what dosage you should be taking of x,y,z drug.

    It does put into perspective why LE HATES SR though. Might be good at potentially reducing crime, but can increase the amount of stupid fucking kids who have access drugs who maybe wouldn't normally. Ones who don't understand how the fucking postal service works...

    Only packages that are too big are delivered to your door. So unless you're ordering a Kilo of coke (i sure hope not), it'll go in the box.

    Lol! Granted, this is a stupid question but you all don't have to hate so hard rofl. This buyer is clearly underage and likely hasn't ordered anything (even legal products) international before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While I don't agree with drug use for any developing brain, I'm going to answer your question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It all depends what method they used to ship the order. If it's been shipped express, courier or with tracking, you may have to sign for it and if you're not home, you can pick it up from the post office. If this is the case the delivery driver (Auspost or courier) will leave a card saying they attempted to deliver a package to your house and will give you instructions on how to pick it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if you ordered a small amount and paid for the basic shipping it will just go straight into your letterbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How long has it been since you placed the order? Sometimes it can take weeks to Australia and regardless of what some people claim, we DO have a high seizure rate, it's a simple fact. If it goes to the post office I wouldn't worry, just go and hand them the card you received (you'll probably have to show your ID too) and pick up the package, after all, it's only a simple letter *wink*.

    Though you called me stupid.  &gt;:( but thanks for your answer.
    <br/>
    That is what I wanted to know. Because I don't know how large the package is going to be! .. Some vendors say it would be like an everyday mail. But I'm assuming if you order pills they would have to add stuff to prevent them from being crushed. So that might make the package bigger. But letterboxes in OZ usually big enough to drop medium size packages in.
    <br/>
    If that is the case, that would be great :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dunno .. but signing on the package is a lil freaky. and going to the post office to pick it up is more freaky. Cuz they DO ask what's in it.

    Instead of putting down newcomers to SR, we should be helping them... 2 important reasons...
    <br/>
    1: This is meant to be a community of drug enthusiasts working together to help one another achieve whatever it is they desire through SR, with minimal interference from the law.
    <br/>
    2: A new user on SR who orders something without having a clue what there doing is just as irresponsible as an established SR user would be if he/she were to turn their backs on the new user. It is damaging to the SR community when packages get seized or when buyers/sellers get caught, so why not do the best we can to prevent this happening.

    ghr85 whilst I can appreciate where you are coming from, I beleive new members should be taking advice from more experienced members. The OP is trying to argue that there is no information on this forum to benefit him/her, stating the search function didn't yield any info -_-  Whilst we might be all working together, I think it is important to note the particular age of this vendor, and in all honesty I believe SR is certainly not for them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Spoon feeding new comers is not going to benefit the SR community whatsoever, they should be able to read for themselves and understand the ramifications when things fuck up. Many on this thread have tried to guide the OP, I know Moksha did for a fact, and then gave up due to the OP's immaturity. If new SR users can't read the abundant amount of Aussie threads out there (there is fucking heaps it is getting embarrassing) then they don't belong here to begin with. There's a big difference between a SR user who needs help and who is just too darn lazy.

    fuck retarded dumb new users. i couldnt give a shit, if they cannot be fucked sorting their own shit, who cares.
    <br/>
    this aint some kip mcgrath for SR users. you want to come on here and start ordering drugs, from overseas! you HAVE to know your shit., you cant just teach that in a couple of days / weeks.
    <br/>
    it comes from learning on your own. and lets face it, the old saying, you learn best from your mistakes could never be truer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im here to help, and have helped many people, not just buyers. but fucked if im going to waste my time teaching some asshat about pgp, or howto use TOR.
    <br/>
    that shit you cant teach. you have to learn that yourself. metadata. ip address. vpns, bridges, proxies. all this shit needs to be known and understood before you start on the road.
    <br/>
    the dumber people are on here the more risk it is for buyers. recently the stupidity of a aus vendor amazed/still amazes me, im waiting for the cunt to be pinched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    having seen this place grow for over 12 months now, its amazing how things have changed, however on this forum, we are the laughing fucking stock. so many bullshit threads, then some other lazy cunt comes along and starts another one. aus shipping gets closed, we start another.. fuck!

    What savvy is required apart from using TOR and PGP ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Things that make a good stealth vendor and reduces risk of intercepts:

    Random and ever-changing (but real) return business addresses.
    <br/>
    Vac sealing.
    <br/>
    Cleaning outside of vac seal with alcohol.
    <br/>
    Changing up packing methods.
    <br/>
    Shipping in envelopes only.

    When have they ever asked whats in it? They never have to me. How would you even know without opening it? But make sure, if they ask, you answer honestly  "its 5 grams of cocaine sir".

    but seriously, if your paranoid, order without tracking and not express. it'll be left in the letterbox.

     fuck retarded dumb new users. i couldnt give a shit, if they cannot be fucked sorting their own shit, who cares.
     <br/>
     this aint some kip mcgrath for SR users. you want to come on here and start ordering drugs, from overseas! you HAVE to know your shit., you cant just teach that in a couple of days / weeks.
     <br/>
     it comes from learning on your own. and lets face it, the old saying, you learn best from your mistakes could never be truer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     im here to help, and have helped many people, not just buyers. but fucked if im going to waste my time teaching some asshat about pgp, or howto use TOR.
     <br/>
     that shit you cant teach. you have to learn that yourself. metadata. ip address. vpns, bridges, proxies. all this shit needs to be known and understood before you start on the road.
     <br/>
     the dumber people are on here the more risk it is for buyers. recently the stupidity of a aus vendor amazed/still amazes me, im waiting for the cunt to be pinched.
