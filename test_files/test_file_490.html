    i received a package that was shipped tuesday and delivered monday (priority). i figured it was slow because of the holidays. on the back of the box there is a large, fluorescent orange sticker saying 'partial box.' on the front of the box it says 'partial roll' with a small, same colored orange sticker. none of the postage is marked out. any ideas what this could mean? i'm out of town for a few days and cannot open the box, i have only been told of it's arrival.

    That is a little weird, are you expecting it to come in multiple packages? thats the first thing to pop in my head when you say partial box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But then again it could be just some random sticker on the box. I remember this was USPS through NYC customs the inspection sticker color was bright green. that was about 1 year ago.

    "on the front of the box it says 'partial roll' with a small, same colored orange sticker."

    They must have identified that the box only contains half of an E pill. ;)

    No, I am not sure what it means.  It almost sounds like packaging/shipping info from a previous order and the box was reused.  Definitely let us know what it is referring to.
