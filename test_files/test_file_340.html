    Is anyone aware of a new USPS policy that states that First Class Large Envelopes must have no disproportionate thickness of anything more than 1/4 inch?  As in, one modest-sized pill at one part of the envelope would cause the envelope to be sent back to the return address.  Or, instead of paying $1.75, you can pay $2.xx and the Large Envelope will go through just fine.

    Based on a reliable informant's statement, my bubble mailer was "returned" to the address.  It had 29 addies and was well discrete.  The reason given: over 1/4 inch thick is too thick for $2 postage.  Needless to say the return address "sender" was clueless, and exonerated.  Not a laughable scenario, though.  Gonna have to buy the guy a beer and give em' a xannie, after that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Scary because almost all pills are over 1/4 long or thick.  No word on how they made the thickness determination.

    I believe it's not to jam the sorting machines that they use.  I've had regular mail shredded in one of those machines before, the Post Office sent it back in a clear plastic baggie that had "Sorry about your mail" or something to that effect printed on it. My letter looked like someone had torn it into pieces, but I'm assuming it got jammed in the gears somehow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW - the package was a legal item shipped in a regular envelope (it was a paintball marker trigger.)  Was probably over a 1/4" thick, now that I think about it.

    Was this a regular seized letter?  Mine was a large bubble mailer.  I figure those things are over a half inch thick when there is nothing in them, so I'm still scratching my head on this one...

    1/4" thickness is the max for letter rates, iow 45 cents for the first oz. If its over 1/4" and less than 3/4", then its large envelope rates which is $.90 for the first oz. If the thickness is not even and it's more than 1/4" difference then the rate jumps to $1.95 for the first 3 oz. If its more than 3 oz the rate goes up a little bit. If its over 13 oz then parcel post rates go into effect which are more expensive and nothing over 13 oz can go into a blue box. So break up your bulk shipments into smaller amounts so you don't have to go into the post office.

    Thank you for that, sunny.
    <br/>
    I should use a scale.  I am quite sure that two sheets of printer paper and 29 pills is less than 3 oz, but maybe it was .1+ over and that's what went wrong.  3 oz is almost 1/4lb, right?  That can't be it grrr....

    The 1/4 inch rule applies to letter-grade mail. The reason is that the most basic letter-grade mail service uses sorting machines that can damage thicker envelopes. Large Envelopes ALSO fall under this rule.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obligatory Clearnet warning: postcalc.usps.com has a treasure trove of knowledge on the restrictions and guidelines for various services/package types... Click the (?) symbols at the bottom next to Letter, Large Envelope, etc to get the rules. Here's the Large Envelope rules:

    Here's where it gets tough: A large envelope, let's say a 7x11 brown envelope (NOT bubbler mailer) CAN get away with letter-grade postage if it meets the above requirements. But it ALSO has to meet these requirements:

    If that 7x11 envelope has a piece of paper in it, it is okay for letter-grade postage. If there are pills inside the envelope to make it past 1/4 inch thickness, it MUST be given First Class Package postage, as it is now considered 'nonmachineable'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another example- birthday cards are considered letter-grade, however if it's one of those fancy birthday cards with electronics and sound, a USPS worker will recommend it be shipped as a First Class Package to avoid damage from sorting machines.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, DCN stickers and letter-grade mail do not mix. Adding a DCN will upgrade any envelope/bubble mailer to First Class Package automatically.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The upside to First Class Packages is that at long as you don't break the 12 inch any dimension and 13-ounce limits, FCPs are very versatile. I've shoved a half-pound bulky action figure into an 8x11 bubble mailer that was almost 4 inches thick and Blue Boxed it out, no problem. I've never ordered pills but I think using 6x9 bubble mailers (3M or Duck brand) as FCP + DCN is the cheapest and most reliable way to do it.
