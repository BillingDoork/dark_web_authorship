    I am looking for a vendor that can ship good quality ketamine in an official or personal letter that can not be discovered after opening. Not even when looking for drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This means it should be placed inside paper which is placed inside some article or magazine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kind of like sending drugs to a prison without dogs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping inside some card will not work. Shipping inside something edible also does not work. Probably shipping inside lotion will not work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perhaps teleportation.. sighh...

    They are out there, your best bet is to find some top rated vendors for this substance and ask them if they are able to do this for you when they package it.
