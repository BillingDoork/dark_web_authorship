    I'm not sure your asking the right group about what minimum requirements would be. We tend to be as safe as possible. I'm sure you may get orders through with minimal security some of the time (depending on the quantity) but wouldn't it be nice to know it'll work EVERY time (or damn near every time at least). Here are a few hints:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Use printed labels. This can be done online using prepaid gift cards.
    <br/>
    2) The return address should be a business which sends a product to clients that you can hide the packaged coke in. The zip code of the address you drop the package off at (blue box or shipping center) should be the same as the business unless otherwise noted on the shipping label.
    <br/>
    3) The packaging must be secure and sturdy, but not overly taped as if you have something you REALLY don't want spilling out in there. Some tape is obviously OK.
    <br/>
    4) Vac seal your product once or twice and then invest in some MBB's. This is critical for anything going over seas. If the dog can't smell it, it can't find it either  :)
    <br/>
    5) Make sure the product is being mailed to a correctly formatted, clean drop house address with the name of a currently residing resident. A business address or PO box would obviously have the same rules apply.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These are the basics. Everyone has their own methods but I think you will find the above stated is pretty solid. There are little things you can do which you can find here on the forums, but if you have the above stated down pat you are likely to find success here. Best of luck!
