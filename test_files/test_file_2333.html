    post box is easy, wipe it down with something that contains alcohol, like those wipes for glasses and whatnot. Prints are mostly fat, so alcohol is a safe bet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A letter is a bit more problematic as the paper "soaks" in that fat. Although getting latent prints off paper is harder than off more solid surfaces, it's also harder to remove them. You'd have to smudge up the paper quite a bit.

    After rubbing hard to get the prints off the paper or smearing them, write over with a sharpie? Cover the area with White Out? Or a sticker label...
    <br/>
    Last resort... put your toe print(s) all over the area where you know the fingerprints are. Maybe it would cover up or otherwise obscure the fingerprint(s), at least when prints are being dusted for.
    <br/>
    Just some ideas off the top of the dome.
