    That just doesn't make any sense. Not having a dig at you personally MaxB, but I just find it impossible to believe that if it was indeed opened by Customs and the vac seal over the drugs was also opened, that they would look at it, stick it back in the envelope and send it back out on it's way to it's final destination. The only reason that could happen is if the "drugs" were in fact a fake replacement and when tested by Customs, tested clean.

    Exactly mate. The one thing they definitely wouldn't do is go to the trouble of looking for gear, find some and then just post it to you without confiscating it!! Yeah, like that is going to happen! .Looking at the situation and using some common sense, I doubt it's Customs that have your Ket. :-\

    Possibly just a lazy customs inspection, found a suspicious package, tested using the generic testing kit that looks for coke, heroin, amphetamines etc and ketamine didn't show up so it was sent on its' way.

    I am a Canadian Vendor and I just had a letter with hundreds of Xanax bars arrive at my safe house with red tape on it that said "Canadian Customs" They slit open where the bars were "hidden" and MUST have seen them, because they were in plain view.....Every single Xanax bar was there. I know for a fact customs saw it but they still sent it on its way. VERY puzzling to me but I am not worried because I never order my stock to my own home or anywhere near my own home for that matter for reasons that should be obvious. Maybe the customs guy was just a cool dude and shrugged it off? I have no clue but even though the packaging was awesome they completely tore it apart and than taped the letter shut and sent it on its way. As soon as I peeled the tape off the letter the drugs were right their in plain view.....

    I think people need to relax a little and do SERIOUS FUCKING RESEARCH into transport logisitcs and customs on this site instead of sound like paranoid androids.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why is it that people know customs can only check 30 odd percent of incoming mail , rely heavily on equipment and devices that have a failure rate not to mention human failure rates which are far greater and STILL expect there to be no mistakes ever made, with all this aside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never made a mistake at your job? We have 2-3 examples here of some customs staff who were probably thinking about pussy and instead of putting the envelope into the 'burn bin' put it back on the belt going to 'customs cleared' . Even if one staff member made one mistake a year in every customs house, this shit would happen a few times a year minimum.

    Heh... I guess like everyone else these guys have quotas to meet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe they're seeing it so much they just can't be bothered with all the paperwork.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or maybe it was the end of the day and they just wanted to go home and smoke a bong :)

    Either way, this is good news... thanks :)
