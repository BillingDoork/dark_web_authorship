    Well today i went to my PO to check my box for my incoming package of methylone from china.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Instead, there was a small note that said, Sorry We Missed You!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now it says i have to go pick it up from the post office, but the box that says id have to sign for it isnt checked. Why would they not place it in my PO box, why would they need me there? Odd.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone have similar experiences or input?

    It most likely was something that wouldnt fit in your PO box. Thats what my post office does. If it is something that wont fit then i have to pick it up at the desk in the post office.

    Exactly what gridlock said? If you're in Canada it is legal to import.

    So i was a bit worried. It was also a pretty sizeable amount which also made me a little nervous.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully you guys are right though! I hope they dont make me sign for some reason when i go.
