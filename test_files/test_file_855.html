    Ok so I have a very strange problem, I have ordered cocaine from 3 of the top UK vendors (UK -&gt; UK via royal mail) But it never arrives. I have ordered weed, dmt, mdma, lsd, shrooms, ketamine, multiple times from buyers both inside of the UK and outside, but that always arrives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't get seizure letter letters, my address isn't blacklisted because I have received drugs shipments recently. I just don't get it, anyone have any ideas?

    Your getting scammed methinks. 2 domestic orders missing is highly unlikely, unless your vendor has a proven shite trackrecord in the shipping safety dept.

    One for 3 weeks, one for 2 and one just a week. I'm not sure about stolen by post man, I've had various other white powers shipped and they arrived ok. Also my post isn't delayed as i rodered and recived something via royal mail on Thursday and it came on Saturday.

    Very strange and tricky one this. Ive sent and recieved thousands of packages, some legit, some dodgy at differnet address's. Not once has anything gone missing. Royal mail is incredibly reliable, millions of ppl use them every day/ This thieving postie myth crops up a lot, yes it happens but its incredibly rare and highly unlikely.
    <br/>
    No way a postie knows whats in your mail and the fact that its 3 packages/ letters with the same product in is odd, you can rule royal mail out. Which leaves blame to the vendors, but then its 3 different vendors and all are well known.
    <br/>
    This leaves 3 answers. 1.. youve been incredibly unlucky and for some reason all 3 vendors have made a mistake or scammed you. However there is no way of proving this so its just a guess and no evidence to prove
    <br/>
    2. There all the same person, again highly unlucky and again there is no way of proving this so its just a guess and no evidence to prove.
    <br/>
    3. .They have arrived and your trying to scam them and post on the forum to make it look realistic, but we have to give you the benefit of the doubt and we have no way of proving this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So unfortunately its hard for people on the fourms to figure this issue out. Best advice i reckon is contact the vendors. Let them no you havent recieved and see if they can confirm they sent and see how helpful they are. Next stage, if you didnt FE you can go to resolution centre with each to try and get all or some of your money back. Unfortuantely this will give you bad stats
    <br/>
    Hope you get it sorted :)

    The chance of a postman knowing what's in the mail is pretty much zero. Unless they opened it.
    <br/>
    I don't know why people would ever think a postman would know there were drugs in the mail. Nobody knows except the seller and the buyer. That's the whole point.

    BitcoinBillionaires, I'm not sure if they are the same vendors.. have sent a PM to find out, certainly the ones I used were up there though, so can only assume.. I'd be more concerned if they weren't the same tbh, as this would suggest RM upping their game on detection. I have ordered countless times and have until recently had a 99% success rate. Made another order today from a vendor I know I can trust so will update if it arrrives.

    Can you know that for sure? Since SR has hit the newspapers, I'm sure there will be pressure on them to at least introduce some spot checking. I agree that the chances could be extremely slim, but there is still a chance. I do agree that the likliest answer could be selective scamming. Also I didn't FE on any deals. Got 50% refunds.

    There may be pressure and they check international mail but domestic, no. They deliver roughly 70 million items a day. They dont have enough

    Looks like we both had an order from the same vendor that went missing. This could be coincidence but people can draw their own conclusions. They have already been mentioned in this thread and are expensive.

    Ive had my first coke non arrival of late, 6th order with one of the top rated uk vendors. Plus quite a few more during my time on the road even la fluente in mexico came through with his henry and some g13 skunk so badly packaged it made my hallway stink so gods knows what my postie's trolley smelt like.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive been on the road almost 5 months now and have noticed that some vendors haven't changed their packaging in that time which I do think is a little sloppy.

    Well I forgot about this thread till now, so I'll update:
    <br/>
    After ordering from the 4th seller, my cocaine arrived after 2 days. I was so surprised when it came I thought it might be one of the other white powdery drugs i ordered (it my have even taken my silly brain a while to figure if it was cocaine or not!). Anyway, still no packages have arrived from the other vendors (some have kindly offered reships but still no luck). At this point I'm not putting it down to anyone's fault, I know the vendors are trusted and I am not aware of any problems on my end.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now the part that is strange is the cocaine i received from the 4th vendor was not exactly armored to military standard, in-fact it was the standard packaging I get for most drugs, which I think clearly rules out my address being blacklisted (I'm sure I saw some rule about discussing packaging, so I didn't go into specifics).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So to conclude:
    <br/>
    after 4 vendors and about 6 different orders, I did finally receive half a gram of cocaine (Which i must say was very enjoyable), but I am still none the wiser on what caused the loss of all the other shipments.
    <br/>
    I did also order another gram from the 4th vendor but the order was canceled due to the recent bitcoin crash, cause by MtGox upgrading their servers from Commodore to Windows 95. I will try reorder soon and see if that also arrives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (I have chosen to leave out ALL vendor names from now on due to some vendors mistaking this request-for-help thread for a personal attack on them).
