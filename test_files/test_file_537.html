    I don't know if they do this in other countries, but in France (and the UK) the post office can hold your mail for a certain period of time while you're away. It's useful because you can choose to hold only mail that is addressed to you. Has anyone had any experience with these type of services? and is there any reason it would be less safe than receiving it the normal way?

    The only problem I could see with leaving your mail at the post office is if they randomly bring dogs and I'm not sure if they do (at least not in other countries). When you vac seal something it gives you ~3 days (don't quote me on that though) before it starts leaking molecules that the drug dogs can sniff out. Assuming your vendor is a good one, he'll use at least two vac seals which buys you about a week before it starts leaking and if you leave it for more than that and they randomly bring drug dogs then you're shit out of luck. This is all pure speculation and I'm probably wearing a tinfoil hat thinking that way but it's better safe than sorry.

    This is a bad idea, you want your package in the posts hands for as little time as possible.

    ^This.  I don't think that realistically it'll make a difference either way, but why would you purposely tell the post to hold your package that you know contains illegal goods in it?  If it can be avoided....
