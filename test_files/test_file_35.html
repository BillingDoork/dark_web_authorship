    I recently received a small amount of blotters in the mail(or what was supposed to be). The letter was torn open at the end with nothing but a Christmas  card inside it. I'm curious if you guys think this was a customs seizure. The letter doesn't seem suspicious, just a label with my mailing info. Although the number at the end of the label isn't visible and the # was filled in with pen. I was under the impression LSD was pretty much undetectable by customs, i guess i was wrong.  :-[ Do you think it's safe to still use this address?

    Lets just say i was expecting to be in the resolution center anyway  :D.....one other pretty important thing my dumbass forgot to say is there was no return address. It was also an international shipment. I'm thinking customs def got it, but is it safe to still use this address?

    I reckon your address is fine they have bigger fish to follow rather than someone with a little LSD its more likely your mailman has given himself an early present (oh to be a mailman) just order something small that you really wouldn't get in trouble for like 1 blotter or a point or sample of something. But just remember to put foil on all your windows including your car and you will be fine.

    The vendor likely hid the tab inside the card, literally inside it.

    Try peeling apart the card, the blotters might be literally inside the card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was a customs seizure, you would have gotten a letter that they opened the mail and confiscating something. Usually they keep the whole package anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It looks like either a shitty friend of yours or a postal worker stole your drugs, postal workers can spot christmas cards, birthday cards, etc... and know they usually contain money so they probably opened your card looking for money and found lsd instead, and they didnt report anything because then they would need to explain why they opened your mail in the first place. Even if the didnn't take your drugs, they probably fell out because the letter was unsealed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, you most likely not in trouble and its not the sellers fault. Contact the seller (use PGP for this one) and ask if he hid them in the card somewhere, or explain your situation and see if he will reship but remember he is under no obligation to do so.

    What happened here is very rare, don't let it discourage you!
