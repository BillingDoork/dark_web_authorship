    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recently had an order go missing in transit. It was a small domestic order. All other orders that I placed at that time arrived except for that one. One was even international and arrived a few days after the small domestic order should have...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I plan to make a bulk order in the near future from overseas. Do you think the missing (Possibly seized) domestic order caused my address to be flagged?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any info will help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!!!

    At this point, I would personally send myself a package....roughly the same size/weight that you are expecting to order.  Pack and tape it so that you know if it was tampered with.  Making simple marks on the tape edges can do this for you.  If it's delivered without tampering evidence, you should be alright.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You may have a love letter coming your way....how long has it been since it was 'lost'?

    Love letter is customs. This order was domestic.

    It was shipped on the 4th. I already received a refund for the order.
