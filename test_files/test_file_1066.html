    I am not sure if I am going to explain this right but I had a question about shipping .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Back in the day it use to be buy stamps out of the machine and you put them on the package after you weight it or figured out how many stamps to put on the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However now there are these stamps with like coding on it , aka electronic stamps even if you go to one of them weighting machines.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whenever i purchase things on SR people use old school stamps , are these vendors weighting them and then putting them on themselves and delivering them to blue po boxes for pick up ???? I would assume so right ?? would that be a big giveaway to people doing this as ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean you really have to be wanting to avoid going into a po and having them do that for you.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my question is by going into a post office and them weighting it for you and putting the tracking on it even if you pay with cash its still more risky because I assume the po has cameras in the office  , just curious ...

    Couldn't you just use a gift card/prepaid debit card to buy and print labels online off McDonalds wifi? How else are people shipping express and priority?

    They don't let you use just a regular anonymous prepaid card. You have to register it with your name and address and then why send you a legit one with your name printed on it and shit. You can use regular prepaid cards to buy stamps from the machine though, if you're not camera shy.

    This one is a no-brainer.  There's nothing old school about postage stamps.  Simply put... Electronic postage = paper/image trail.   Stamps = no trail

    PS..Don't lick 'em lest you leave behind your DNA

    You dont have to register a prepaid card, at least not with your real name and address.  Then use the same fake return name/addy in usps site to get your labels. Or apparently you can use an unverified paypal account and buy shipping through that, funded with a moneypack or something.
