    So I've been trying to brainstorm some ideas on how to complete more separations between myself and my SR activity and I finally think I found one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How does this sound to you guys?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I plan on ordering one of the fake IDs off SR and put real information on it and use that to open a mailbox at the UPS store. As far as I know, UPS only requires two forms of IDs, both of which are available here on SR. Combined with 24 hour access I believe this is the safest way to receive packages from SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?

    As it has been said many times: You must consider well what if you do get caught? Now you have a fake name registered for that box. Why would you use a fake name unless you are doing something bad?
    <br/>
    So. I would say the only way to be safe using a fake id is if you had super counter surveillance skills. You must consider the worst and that if 'they' are on to you LE will check cameras/door access for 24 hour timestamps of when you pick up packages. Consider that if they are willing to wait there for hours, they may try to stop you and what will you do to explain the fake identity?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't do it and see there being more cons to using a fake name rather than using all legitimate info.

    This.

    <br/>
    If LE stop you walking away with packages, at least you can deny any knowledge of their contents if you are using real information. If you are using fake information it'll look worse, as well as adding a fraud charge.

    That's exactly what I was going to suggest. I have a UPS post box that has someone elses name signed up with it, but it's rather small and far from my house, but only I and one other person have access to it. It's nice because you get a key to go whenever you like. I suggest getting a larger box because sometimes you have to sign if it doesn't fit in the box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would suggest getting a fake Social Security card made as well, as I think you will need more than one form of ID. Also it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a library card and other forms of ID to make the alias more established.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I plan to do this when I have the extra cash, but until then I will use my address and the UPS box that I have. I had a package arrive yesterday at the box and it was too large for the box but I didn't have to sign luckily.

    Don't waste your time with fake SS or Library cards as they are NOT accepted forms of ID when renting boxes.(look up USPS form 1583)  The identification requirements are the same for both private box rentals or USPS boxes.

    Such nonsense.   Obviously, this poster has no idea what they are talking about yet here they are masquerading as an authority on the subject.  It's irrelevant how many times "it has been said".  Repeating the same bad advice over and over will not somehow turn it into sound advice. It's never a good idea to label your illegal activity with your name and address.  Isn't that just common sense?  Just because you may have received drugs in the mail under your real name and address without getting caught does not mean it's a safe practice.  I understand that many people feel they have no other way but to perpetuate this notion that it's the best way is absolutely ridiculous.  ANONYMITY is the name of the game.  Sure, the game can be played employing full disclosure but at a MUCH higher degree of risk to life and liberty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I challenge anyone to research cases of people caught sending or receiving drugs in the mail(or via any other carrier).  They are easy to find using Google.  Then...come back and tell me out of the stories you found, how many people arrested used real names and addresses vs. those that didn't.

    Still you said it was a bad advice and the guy who gave it understands nothing of what he talks about but you have not explained WHY what the guy said was wrong.
    <br/>
    You have only talked about the risks about using your real name and address (that however it's a bit different that using *A* real name and address or a modified name/correct address or any other similar tie) but you skipped completely the part about if LE caught you up with a FAKE ID what you are going to say to them (with a real address and name you have plausibility, in this case you obviously don't)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for your example about googling up the names, that means little just because there are many other parameters involved apart the simple intercept; for example if you deny or not it makes a lot of difference (and many people are so stupid that they think LE are their friends and talk).

    had a friend go for this and i wouldnt do it.
    <br/>
    just a p.o. box in general gives you plausible reasons to deny a package. "im the only person i know in my circle of friends with a p.o. box.
    <br/>
    that looks apealing to someone doing illegal activities. im offended people used my p.o. box for such things. lets figure out who this was."
    <br/>
    if you use a fake i.d. thats more federal charges they would love to pin on someone and say you use a fake name, they catch the package,
    <br/>
    look it up, and its a fake name. obviously it was a fake i.d. used and they will stalk that shit. and as soon as you turn for the door with that package your
    <br/>
    fucked.
    <br/>
    think of it this way.. alot of vendors use legitimate addresses as a return address and if their package doesnt make it, it gets returned there.
    <br/>
    this is a little different but that means drugs are showing up to businesses and people that dont even know what the silk road is.
    <br/>
    in my opinion and correct me if im wrong but a LEGIT p.o. box gives you more deniability then having it delivered to your house.
    <br/>
    and less than if you use a fake i.d. to open one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i agree with BlackIris.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and to "th3creeper"
    <br/>
    wtf... how about everyone go look up "people that got drugs in the mail and denied it and nothing happened"
    <br/>
    and look at the ENDLESS results on that.... not...... do it legit. if you get caught. you have a tool at your disposal
    <br/>
    that attracts sketchy activity so it must have been one of your friends that dont care about your safety and deny.
    <br/>
    the forums are FILLED with close encounters that ended up fairly okay because whoever it was denied everything.
    <br/>
    if you use a fake i.d. and get caught youll be hearing a jail door closing behind you in the near future. if you dont use
    <br/>
    one and get caught.
    <br/>
    im not saying that denying will work 100% but they will have to work HARD for that bust

    I highly recommend reading the postal service inspector thread. It has a lot of good info related to this. Check it out here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically, the moral of the story is its a good idea to set up a fake business at your residence and have your SR packages sent to it. That way your name is not on the package. Also its quite normal for businesses to receive a lot of packages so its not likely to rouse suspicion. The thread also explains why using a fake ID for a PO box is not a good idea.

    There wasn't a whole lot of info about that in the postal inspector thread. It sounds like you don't need to incorporate or anything. Lots of people have home businesses where they buy and sell stuff on Ebay or Amazon. So it sounds like all you would have to do is order a bunch of cheap stuff and get it sent to the fake business at your residence. The point of that would be to establish a pattern so your postal delivery person does not get get suspicious

    If you use a box you got with a fake ID you have to be very careful when picking up your package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stake out the area, establish a perimeter, watch the comings and goings of cars and people, etc. Then you have to get in and out of the store as quickly as possible and get the fuck out of the area. Make sure you aren't being followed and go to a fast food restaurant or another place with bathrooms typically close to the entrance. Open your package, take out contents and dispose of the packaging. This is to make sure there isn't a tracking device inside your package. Then just walk around and make sure you aren't being followed, if you have a stash spot within walking distance stash the goods there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It sounds like a lot of work but it's all worth it to finally smoke that gram of pot you ordered.  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alternative: Get a homeless person to pick it up for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you got one at a place where the scan your ID then just hope that facial recognition software continues to be useless.

     Authorities make arrest after suspicious package found
     <br/>
     Posted: May 8, 2013
     <br/>
     <br/>
     By Savannah Morning News
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One man is in custody after allegedly stealing a package from a post office containing a large quantity of marijuana.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ____________________,  was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Savannah-Chatham police officers responded Tuesday to a report of a theft of a package at the U.S. Post Office on Victory Drive. The postal employee reported that a man attempted to claim the package.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, authorities said the man quickly grabbed the packed and fled on foot, after the employee refused turn it over after noticing the man's name didn't match the name on the package.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Police began canvassing the area where they located the package behind a nearby business and the male suspect, who was later identified as ____________________.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A police K9 and members of the Chatham-Savannah Counter Narcotics Team responded to the scene and determined the package likely contained a controlled substance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CNT Agents conducted a search of the abandoned package and found that it contained more than two pounds of marijuana.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ______________ is being held at the Chatham County jail and is expected to be arraigned today in Chatham County Recorders Court.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Authorities said additional charges may follow in the ongoing investigation.

    I probably have more experience in this game than all the people otherwise commenting on this topic put together.   Some of you noobs seem to be under the illusion you can be pioneers of the scene when the truth is this shit has long been established and stood the test of time.  Staying alive in this game isn't about knowledge..it's about experience.   Nothing is fail safe and you can never eliminate all the risk but you can damn sure minimize the risk.  Most of you are new to all this... but that's not the problem.  Everyone starts somewhere.  The problem is the arrogance.

    How did so many of you come into this scene already knowing how to play the game?

    wanna know whats worse than anything period? your ego..
    <br/>
    do something that you probably havent done before and do some research.
    <br/>
    if your looking for experience then go off by yourself by all means but your not.
    <br/>
    your looking for "knowledge" thats why your in the threads as we speak.
    <br/>
    plenty of nice people answered out in the open for anyone including LE to read.
    <br/>
    why not say thanks? good luck. your going to need that.
    <br/>
    lets hope your "experience" teaches you everything because obviously
    <br/>
    you dont want peoples knowledge they worked hard to get. Also just you saying
    <br/>
    "i probably have more experience in this game than all the people commenting on this topic put
    <br/>
    together." shows you dont know jack!
    <br/>
    this isnt slingin teenths on the street like your probably use to.
    <br/>
    THAT is where experience comes in.
    <br/>
    this is a new age and this is the Silk Road. Knowledge is power
    <br/>
    thats the ONLY reason were still up and running.
    <br/>
    see ya!!
    <br/>
    -Prime
    <br/>
    <br/>
    p.s. alot of the things people just advised you to do and probably have in the past are used by
    <br/>
    LITERALLY the greatest and most successful people in the history of "the game"

    I don't think anyone was saying they were pioneering some new methods, just sharing what works for them. I'm not sure I saw the arrogance you're talking about? Threads like this pop up again and again, almost always going the exact same. No fool proof method is ever discovered and few people agree on the exact method, to each their own.

    False identification to law enforcement and possession of a false identification card is a summary offense in most jurisdictions, essentially no big deal.... except it ruins any plausible deniability you might have.  Misrepresenting yourself to a UPS store or even USPS office is not a criminal offense, but if either organization incurs any damage from your conduct they may file a civil suit against you.
