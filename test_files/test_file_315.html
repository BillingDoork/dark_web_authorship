    I'm paranoid having drugs shipped directly to MY HOUSE. Is there somewhere safer that I can ship to that doesn't raise any red flags? (A friends house is not an option)
    <br/>
    The shipment is nothing too large - 50 ecstasy pills
    <br/>
    Any ideas?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance

    The person who lived here before me still gets junk mail, so I used her name. But my mail never came, and I think the postman denied it because her name isn't on our mailbox (in an apartment). That blows. Could I just put down my address and NO name? Do postmen no mail things just because there is no name??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, does denied mail just get returned to the sending address? And if there is no one at the sending address to receive it (like if it's fake or something), then where does it end up?

    Your next best bet is getting a PO box, but you might as well be paranoid about that too because you're gunna need some ID to get one. I guess you could order some fake forms of ID through the SR first though.
