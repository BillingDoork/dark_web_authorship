    Hey everyone. I'm thinking of becoming a vendor. I'd like to know if it's standard to flatten nugs before sending them out? I was thinking of flattening them, putting them in MBB and then lining stacks of paper with them. I just don't know if anyone would buy flat nugs.

    I would think there are better ways to do it and still be safe. There's no way all the tree on the road is flat. That shit would piss me off if I ordered it.

    Personally I would never buy flat nugs, I just hate it. There are many possibilities to send the nugs intact..

    Generally people don't want flattened nugs. Some people use a box; others a padded envelope. Both seem to work as long as the innermost bag or two is just sealed (but not vacuum sealed). Make sure to read up on mylar and MBB's; just the plain clear polyethylene food sealer bags alone are not adequate, they will scent through pretty easily. The mylar, MBB's, foil seem to work extremely well.

    All the bud I've received has been in great condition. You can always order from an experienced vendor to see how they keep their buds safe. Having good shipping methods is something that customers really appreciate and will help your business.

    Haha ok silly question but I had to ask. I wouldn't buy flat nugs either. :p I'm just trying to think of the cheapest way to stealth just for starting out. That $500 + packaging shit ain't cheap!

    Well it is a bit of an investment. I have seen it down with just a few food saver polyethylene vacuum bag, but it required a scenting agent to keep the smell down, which is not a good idea.

    If you can't afford proper packing supplies, then you have no business being on here as a vendor.

    Yeah I'm just asking questions about methods. I won't be selling more than 10g at a time so keeping shipping costs to a minimum is ideal.

    I dont blame you for asking this question at all and I have thought about this quite abit myself.
    <br/>
    I order all kinds of drugs off here but its all powders/pebbles/pills and lsd(the easiest) so Its easy to disguise it in a letter so you cant feel/smell. But Bud is a whole diff ball game. I smoke weed every day but wont order it here or anywhere so it comes in the mail. The main reason is because I have alot better options then paying premium on here. But even if I didnt, I still dont think I would order it in the mail.
    <br/>
    Its just so bulky for any amount worth ordering and then of course the smell!!!. I dont know how they are doing it , especially for this Big amounts I hear about ! Crazy!!!! must be some crazy super stealth that is almost genius and most people dont know about it cause Its gotta be hard to get that shit thru customs especially .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this cant be easy ans deff has to be the hardest drug to send in the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I once broke down and orderd hash because I hadnt had good imported hash in years and that was only after thourgh resarch on the vendor and his stealth reviews. and I was worried about that one and its just hash which doesnt smell nearly as strong as dank ass bud and is not as recognizeable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Props to all you mofos that sell and buy that shit in the mail.
