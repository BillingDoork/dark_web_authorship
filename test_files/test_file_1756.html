    I'm currently having issues with a vendor over a non-delivered package. At the time of purchase, it struck me how wildly expensive their mailing charge was if you wanted a registered, traceable item; while their snail mail rate was relatively cheap. I hadn't seen that before, and of course I went with the cheaper option. But recently I've noticed more vendors doing the same thing; offering relatively cheap shipping rates for untracked packages shipped overseas (a few dollars) and ridiculously high rates for tracked items ($100+). Many go out of their way to state in their terms and conditions that they won't refund or will only offer a small refund in cases of non-delivery if package isn't registered (traceable) mail. Yet they make the shipping cost of this so high that no one would pay for it. I can't help but doubt their intentions. Is this a new trend, or am I just noticing it because it recently affected me?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or is there some other reason why a vendor would charge so much for registered mail?

    I read somewhere on here that international tracked packages cost like 80 dollars to ship. Not sure if that's true put if it is that would not seem to off from 100 after exchange rate and fees.  They said letter mail was much cheaper. Somone that ships international may be able to fill in or you could check prices for shipping services online

    To deter you from purchasing it so they could scam you on the un-tracked /no refund option?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some buy items to ship your product in for improved stealth.  Couldn't see it costing +$100.

    Idk which vendor it was but at his/her profile I saw sth equal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I thought the same way you think, they want to avoid a refund!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It cannot cost that much, cause if you send it as a package it costs mostly 10€/12$.
    <br/>
    You can even send a letter as a package and it´s tracked, too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think there should be some investigation from SR-stuff to avoid such behavior.
    <br/>
    Maybe a thread to collect these vendors at one place??

    The limousine, super high priority stuff through UPS/DHL etc that gets delivered overnight or within two working days or whatever - sure, that'll cost $80-100. But that's not the shipping these guys use, it's just standard USPS or equivalent airmail that takes minimum 5 working days to reach you. It costs $20 max (assuming you're buying personal quantities). Add another $20 for packaging. Not even close to what's being asked in my case.

    Well, that's my suspicion.
