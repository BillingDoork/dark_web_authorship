    Just curious what everyone's thoughts are about this. I'm sure the mail will run as usual.
    <br/>
    Do you think customs will be beefed up any? Doesn't seem relevant considering the ricin was sent from within the states.

    There are a few ways .  HUMIT, he talked to someone about his plans in person . Signit did something online to get himself flagged.  Or the easiest  letter was backtracked to the drop off and he was identified via some security footage. Then SIGNIT comes into play .  As plain as a Monday.

     I do remember Ricin being sold on BMR just a couple weeks ago, someone did buy it.. so you never know. other than that you can expect strict processing soon. upgraded XRays, GCMS machines.. etc..  the bottom line is, things WILL change, maybe not today, but soon. it was gonna happen either way. good things dont last and the government is always trying to catch up to us "bad guys".

    No way could every letter and parcel be GCMS'd and X-rayed... so what will it matter if they are "upgraded" in the USPS forensics lab?  Upgraded how?  I'm sure their GCMS/X-ray's are already top of the line.

    it will now be easier to smuggle drugs. With the country now spending more time and resources looking for ricin, they'll miss the drug packages. They'll train more drug dogs to sniff ricin or cyanide instead of cocaine or heroin. Won't make much of a difference, but it tips it slightly in our favor IMO

    I don't think it's even true. For whatever reason they put this story out at the same time as the terrorist bombings in Boston. Seems the same thing happened around 9-11. No stories get out by accident anymore. They are put out. The days of Watergate are over. The White House press corps, are nothing more than stenographers waiting for the next set of talking points.

    Perhaps the ricin story was made up to trigger sympathy for an administration that let us down by deballing agencies like the FBI, with their liberal pacifist ideologies. These agencies should've been profiling these Chechen Muslim radicals, instead they were probably attending diversity training on how not to 'offend' Muslims.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, I don't think it will have an effect on SR.

    Altho I'm a little nervous how they were actually able to trace back that letter so quickly back to the person who wrote it..
    <br/>
    Does that mean any letter or pack with drugs can be traced back to the person who sent it if they put in enough time and resources?

    I haven't read too in depth about the guy they busted, but I recall a headline stating he was mentally ill so if that is the case then he probably didn't take the same precaution people from the road do when mailing stuff. That or it is a set up which made it so easy for them to find the "culprit".

    I just hope nothing too serious happens via mail that would give the government the support they need to just search mail as they please.

    There was a news article that stated the reason for his capture so fast was that he has a long history of writing letters to national leaders, his package was shipped without a return address, and he included writing and information which was included on his facebook page.

    The government has always known of the mail as a potential risk vector, nothing will change.

     I do remember Ricin being sold on BMR just a couple weeks ago, someone did buy it.. so you never know. other than that you can expect strict processing soon. upgraded XRays, GCMS machines.. etc..  the bottom line is, things WILL change, maybe not today, but soon. it was gonna happen either way. good things dont last and the government is always trying to catch up to us "bad guys".
