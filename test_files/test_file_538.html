    Just enough for some personal use, no more than 5 pills probably. And it wud b ordering from aus to aus ... so would it even really get checked at all???
    <br/>
    If they found it would i get chased down or would this go on my record? - im still living with my parents and studying to be a primary school teacher at the moment so anything would be damaging.

    If your buying and shipping domestic, I think that is the safest way to be honest. I have been on the SR for 3 months now, and I have never order international. Domestic shipping is the way to go to be safe! Also, I recommend that you take a look through the vendor review forum, and to carefully select your vendor. They wont be touched by any problem with the packaging (unless they actually put their return address) If you read through the SR buyer's guide (which I highly recommend you do) and at the top right of the SR you'll see "a few brief words from Dread Pirate Roberts" or something like that, click it and read that!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As with anything illegal, you run the risk of a little bit of legal backlash, but the buyers guide and DPR point out some very good advice and tips to minimize the risk of buying from the SR. I hope all goes well with your purchases and your schooling!

    Its no worse than using a PO Box/Mailbox with your ID attached to it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In fact ... if its just gonna be sporadic use youre better off using your house. Nothing fishy there. Renting a mailbox for 1-2 foreign envelopes a month might raise an eyebrow.

    As Bear stated, domestic is always your best bet, f customs. A small order like five pills would be no worry at all.

    I was using a P.O. box but now I have switched to a home address and I switch to friends houses sometimes. I prefer overseas shipping when it comes to large amounts because the meds are cheaper overseas. I had a package seized and lost a few hundred Xanax but was only sent a letter of seizure which asks you if you want to claim them. I threw that away I was not about to sign anything that had anything to do with that package. I worry about domestic shipping because of Federal charges which I am sure you can get if you sign for or accept a package coming form overseas but from my experiences they just confiscate the package. I have a friend who also orders overseas and received 4 love letters (seizure letters) before he smartened up lol. The dipshit called the USPS to claim a package and they asked him if he a was a fucking idiot lol. Anyway he switched addresses and had not had a problem since. It really doesn't matter whether you use a P.O. Box or a home address, you have a lot of variable to take into account.

    Ordering domestic is fine, no problem at all. I have been here for just over a month and have had 12 perfect domestic transactions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its just mail being delivered everyday. Enjoy ordering your product of choice and have fun. ;)

     Hi ,
     <br/>
     I want to ship domestic (Canada) to my home address (Canada)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1.
     <br/>
     Can i specify same province as I am in to reduce chance of hassle ?
     <br/>
     2.
     <br/>
     In my building, there is a mini-parcel-handling office in this building
     <br/>
     A guy handles all the large parcels and the small letter sized mail goes direct into our mailboxes but 'special' mail (registered etc. may go to the 'office' i spoke about)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For small green stuff orders is this okay ?
     <br/>
     &lt;20g
     <br/>
     Any thoughts would be appreciated
     <br/>
     First time and all
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks
     <br/>

    If by "green stuff" you mean you are concerned about odor, just make sure the vendor uses at least a double vac with a mylar layer.  Some vendors triple vac, I saw one vendor doing quad vac.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this information is not posted on the vendor's home page or in the listing, then send the vendor a PM. Explain that you have a cluster mail box and office situation &amp; that you are concerned about odor. Ask if they use mylar.  Odor may begin to leach from food sealer packages after a few days, mylar gives you longer.  If your vendor is using mylar I say no prob to ship to a home address. Good luck.
