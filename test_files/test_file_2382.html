    I am going to send a padded envelope with cash internationally. This seems illegal from what I've been reading. At first I thought I'd just not put a return to sender address on the envelope, but now I'm thinking they might be suspicious if there is no such address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Would I be better off putting a random address to someone who shares my zip code as the return address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would also like some input as to whether coins or paper money are most often detected in the mail services. I have some paper money and some coins that I would like to send, but if coins are unsafe I could skip those. Skipping the paper money is out of question I'm afraid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Am I better of not sending the coins?

    Strange. OK:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is NOT illegal to mail US currency. It is NOT ADVISABLE, but not illegal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do not include change/coins as any postal worker who feels it will rob you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is still a really bad idea, and you are doomed to be ripped off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    with that said if its not for a SR purchase, why not use your return address. that way when it never gets there you can get your tattered envelope back in a plastic bag with a canned letter from the post master general telling you "we are sorry on of our "machines" ate and mangled your letter".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ....if you care to explain yourself a bit, there are better ways.

    Alright, I'll skip the coins then.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am buying bitcoins and the only anonymous method available for someone living in Sweden seems to be payment method: mail in cash (I have not been able to find a Swedish seller and can therefore not pay with an anonymous bank deposit). I have read on the website of our mail service that it is illegal to send cash in the mail, but on several occasions I have recieved cash in mail on my birthdays from my grandparents, so it has worked before, not internationally however.

    Yes, well I was speaking from the U.S.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do not know what your law is there. I still would not recommend this. The person you are sending coins to will more then likely rip you off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It happens all the time around here. Find someone in your country and ask how they get coins.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or google "How to get bit coins in Sweden"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    that might help too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    dont just part with your cash so easily.

    Btw. I did by an expensive padded envelope, so the maximum "package depth" of 3 cm does not apply. I would assume this means they won't put the envelope through one of those machines. I also packaged the coins so that you would need a lot of imagination to think of them as coins if you feel the package with your hands.

    LOL. You think I didn't google it? Well, I did, and there's nothing to find. The seller is trusted and I am 99.8% certain he won't rip me off. He's got a solid reputation.

    Thank you! I saw this before and ignored it because I assumed you would have to ID yourself, but for smaller amounts of money you don't. I've found one good review for the site and I am tempted to try it out. I wish there would be some more reviews, though. Now I am late and need to run! I'll look further into this as soon as I find the time.

    Here's your update Shroomeister. Both methods worked! I did encounter some struggles with btcx that might be due to my inexperience with bank accounts (my first time ever inserting money into a bank account!) or the fact that I look suspiciously young, but it worked. If anyone wants to use this method PM me and I'll give you some advice, because it wasn't as straight forward as it could have been and I had to use some creativity to work around certain issues (again this could just be common sense if you're used to dealing with bank accounts, but I doubt it). The envelope shipping also worked perfectly and the seller kept his promise.
