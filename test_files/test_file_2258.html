    Can't you get everything you want locally anyway? I loved the otc benzos and excellent heroin over there. Only thing I thought could do with improving was the cannabis. The ice was good too.

    It is very difficult as a foreigner here. You cannot trust anyone. Dealers are cops. Everyone snitches you off. Asking around only brings unwanted attention to you.  Using the mail is the safest. But then nothing is safe here. If a local dealer is busted the first thing he gives up is the foreigner. Easier to buy dope in USA or Europe

    Idk man, have you tried or are you going on what you got told and heard? because in my experience it's not that crazy there. Strict sure, but unlike the guidebooks say Thais aren't really all selling you a bag and then stitching you up after. Buy from the Nigerians in Nana Plaza, BKK. Also, I got busted with a wrap of heroin over there by two cops and bribed my way out of it.

    Define mid level? No, it has to be a fairly large amount, like a wholesale amount to warrant death and they very rarely execute farang nowdays. Only thai. Farang get life or long sentences. But if you do it quickly you can bribe them. You want to do it before more cops show up and. The more cops that get invovled, the more you need to pay. South East Asia is very corrupt - I'd actually suggest you take a drug holiday to PP, Cambodia. Very easy to score and the locals keep mum. They're shit scared of authorities and aren't as enterprising as the Thai. They're quite simple folk but the amount of tourists coming in, they're starting to learn how it goes.

    You can buy off a murder in Cambodia for 8-10,000 US. Drugs significantly less.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you just want some benzos you can buy them in pharmacies in Thailand eaaaasily. No trouble whatsoever. The pharmacists won't call the police and prescription laws aren't strongly enforced. You will get in trouble if you get searched and have them without their packaging though. They actually give them out in ziplock bags with writing on them over there. Hope this helps.

    I love thailand. When I can, I'm moving there to live

    hello
    <br/>
    i am living in Thailand in the last few years, and its very easy to get every thing by mail, there is not hard control, because the big drugs problem are the drugs going out like heroin,  or ice that come mostly from laos or borma,  so  i think they better thing to do that caring for few farans drugs.  but be caution because if some thing get wrong, its bad, this is not Europe, and u don't want to have any problems in Thailand.
