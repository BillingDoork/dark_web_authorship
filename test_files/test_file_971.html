    So I check my box and saw a "sorry we missed you" slip in there which I thought was odd since I ordered domestic
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Looking a it, it says that I need to go and pay the postage due  balance that's on the package to get the item. but doesn't have any tracking or shipping info on where it came from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has this happen to others before?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?
    <br/>

    <br/>
    Thank you.

    I have had this happen to me on a legitimate order from a third party on Amazon marketplace.  I believe they printed their own postage label with one of those machines that businesses have, but they didn't put the right amount.  Not sure why they didn't return to sender, but they gave me the slip to go pick it up at the post office and I had to pay like $2 or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    edit:  agree with llok - ask vendor if there's any tracking info, and how did he pay postage?  Stamps? Postage label machine with his own scale?

    Contacted the vender and all that was said was
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes no problems ..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its very safe .. you can go there and pick it up
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yea right   Real assuring....... I mean i feel like everything is fine for it hes a legit guy. just sucks on communication.  now I have to clean shit out my house now to be safe over something that shouldn't even be an issue. I'm sure there is no issue here...But how shitty would it be to go pick it up and not do some tiding up when you really needed to and it was all you needed to do.
