    Hello there!
    <br/>
    The domestic market in Norway has been pretty decent lately but it's all weed and pretty expensive, so I have been playing with the idea of ordering some great hash (thinking culero from emerald) but I am insanely worried that it would get seized.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else from Norway that have ordered hash/cannabis products? Maybe even from emerald?
    <br/>
    Also could get some nice stuff for a fair price from Sweden, would this be a safer choice than Spain?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry if this is a stupid thread to make but I have searched my ass off, messaged vendors and the few people I could find that have ordered to Norway before and everywhere I look some say it's completely fine and some say not to bother trying. emerald's feedback is mostly great too but there are some no-shows and some people saying the stealth is bad and that it wouldn't get through some customs. Man, I hate making decisions! :p
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for any answers!

    Hello there!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am sorry I could not reply to you earlier. While I do not recommend ordering from Spain to Norway, I have not ordered from emerald specifically. There seems to be many seized packages lately to Sweden, this may apply to Norway also.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My guesstimate is that it is safer to order from Sweden, albeit more expensive. Speak to vendors (emerald) and ask about the success rate for orders to your country prior to ordering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck,
    <br/>

    Spain and Holland, no offense, are viewed badly by customs
    <br/>
    you can still ask for a particular stealth for your order, giving advice on how to pack and by paying a little extra for greater attention to detail
