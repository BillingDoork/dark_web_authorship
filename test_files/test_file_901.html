    Hey everyone i was listening to JRE podcast the other day and they mentioned stamps.com sounds like it would be a really good thing for vendors to use and apparently they have a deal on at the moment where you get like $25 of free stamps and a free digital scale... seemed like a sign to me that this was a good thing for vendors when i heard free digital scale ha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway just thought i would let people know about it check it out if you want or don't either way is good.

    Forget about stamps.com. For one thing, they are the worst according to many reports. Lousy customer service, poor software, if the label doesn't print you can wait forever for a refund. Besides, they want a credit card and an address to send the cheap scale to. Is there anything else you would like le to know about you if they intercept one of your packages?

    Of course you have to carefully and anonymously buy these sorts of things, but once you have a PC Postage system set up, they work well.  Metered postage looks much more professional than a bunch of stamps.  I wish more vendors would use this sort of stuff....

    How do you "carefully and anonymously buy these sorts of things"? With a stolen cc? Not a good idea. Lets say they take a gift card. I have one of those but i don't know if they will take them, do you know? Where are you going to have the scale sent? What if its returned to sender or the person says they never ordered it? Of course you have to use a vpn each time you access it. It might be just as easy to do with usps and i know that's hard. If you know how, let the rest of us know?

    You need to step back and think outside the box man. There are many different ways, and we can't all be doing the same thing.
