    Ok, so I am new at this and I had recently ordered a package about two months ago and it never got to my place. I assumed customs seized it but I was never sent a letter. Not thinking about it until now, I have several more little packages (4 different packages) on the way and I am worried as to what will happened. Do you think my original package was seized by customs despite no letter? And what were to happened if they seized the other packages? I am freaking out any information would be helpful thanks!

    custom letters are never sent (atleast in my experinece and reading from here) when the package involves illegal drugs (prescription drugs they are sent)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so your package was probably either seized or you were scammed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have never heard of anyone being raided for small amounts of shit, at worst they will probably send uniforms around to talk to you, jsut deny deny. and make sure your security is tight.

    dont stres about it.

    yes there is a chance..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But this is controversial. Some people say yes definitely, others say its a myth.
    <br/>
    there is no way to know for sure.
