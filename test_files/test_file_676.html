    For shits and giggles though. I suppose it would be kinda funny to see a package full of gear opened up in the cop shop reception desk.

    In all seriousness though, it would probably (eventually) land the vendor in a bit of bother.

      Offtopic as this post might be, but I started wondering, what if I did send a package to the police station? I'll just buy a package as I would, but would write the police station's address.

      Any speculations? lol

      All the very best to you all!

     Why on earth would you do that? lol
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For shits and giggles though. I suppose it would be kinda funny to see a package full of gear opened up in the cop shop reception desk.

     You'd never be able to go and enjoy the mom to though would you? lol

     In all seriousness though, it would probably (eventually) land the vendor in a bit of bother.

    In all seriousness, if anyone deserves to be in prison other than murderers and rapists, it's sitamaja. That is the most FUCKED UP idea I've ever heard. Why would you want to get a vendor arrested?
