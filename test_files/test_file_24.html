    I'm interested in purchasing some blotters from within the US because as far as I understand, the product is legal if it's not for human consumption. My questions: are customs involved if the shipment is domestic and would the product be considered for human consumption because it is on blotters? I understand the likelyhood of blotters being intercepted is less because they are more smaller and more difficult to detect/smell but has anyone had trouble with this? and suppose there were traces of illegal chemicals like 2C-E - would that be reason for conviction? Also if I were to buy illegal substances and the vendor got busted do you think there would be records of my address to convict me?
    <br/>

    Thanks a bunch.

    the customs is only for international however law enforcement/DEA etc is always interested in domestic distribution
    <br/>
    I doubt the defense that it was "for my dog" would work when it is on printed blotters filled with smile faces
    <br/>
    when you buy illegal drugs there is never a guarantee that what you are getting is pure or even what you asked for, the FDA does not regulate anything here.
    <br/>
    If the vendor got busted then there is no guarantee they kept a clean shop, and destroyed your address. You don't even know you're talking to a vendor who is not already an agent. If they impersonate young girls to entrap pedophiles I don't see any reason they can't impersonate vendors on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So there you go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can't do the time don't do the crime, as they say.

    Thanks for the responses guys. The vendor has an excellent rep so I'm pretty sure I will be getting what I payed for. Would the product be shipped in an envelope because of it's small size/lack of odor and therefore decrease my chances of getting busted? And if so, are enveloped letters xrayd by shipping companies?
