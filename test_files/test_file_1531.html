    Hi,
    <br/>
    I've got one quick question (3 hrs left).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I made an order that was supposed to be shipped on July 11, 2013. On the 25th, 3 days before the autofinalization I filed for an extension of due date by another 7 days, because the seller announced he had some shipping issues:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="quoteheader">
     <div class="topslice_quote">
      Quote
     </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
     ***28-07-2013: Due to some transportation difficulties we have experienced over the last week orders of the last week been shipped out later than planned. This problem has been taken care of and is a thing of the past. Every order gets send out and every customer gets served. Sorry for the inconvenience.
    </blockquote>
    <div class="quotefooter">
     <div class="botslice_quote">
     </div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But there's two dates that don't match. Under 'proposed resolutions' and 'freshness' I've got this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="quoteheader">
     <div class="topslice_quote">
      Quote
     </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
     4 days
     <br/>
     July 25, 2013, 3:16 pm UTC
    </blockquote>
    <div class="quotefooter">
     <div class="botslice_quote">
     </div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Whereas under transaction details it says that the 'admin steps in and declares a final resolution' in 3 hours:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="quoteheader">
     <div class="topslice_quote">
      Quote
     </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
     due in: 3 hrs July 30, 2013, 3:13 pm UTC
    </blockquote>
    <div class="quotefooter">
     <div class="botslice_quote">
     </div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    So which one is actually in operation? I'd really want to extend the autofinalization date by yet another few days.

    How it works is you propose a date extension, and the seller either accepts it, ignores it, or proposes something else, in which case if they ignore it or propose something else, at the end of the 3 days the resolution admin will step in and decide which proposition will be most likely, in this case since the vendor was vocal about shipping delays, the admin will most likely chose in your favor.
