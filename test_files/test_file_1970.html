    This question is for other vendors here who offer USPS express as an option. When preparing express shipments (domestic USA only) it appears that I have to use a handwritten address because I am forced to use the form that they make you fill out and stick to the envelope, is this the best way to go about preparing it , is it the only way, or can a label be typed and printed? I assume most waive the signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What about dropping off express packages? Can they be dropped off like any other stamped package in the mail drop boxes that are at the actual post office? The ones at the post office don't mention anything specific about express mail but I am assuming because it is at the actual post office that it will be fine, if not, what is the proper way to drop them?

    From my limited -legal- shipping experience (clearnet vendor) Express can only be typed up if you pre-pay for the shipping via USPS.com or an official postage handler like stamps.com, etc... As far as I know there is no way around this, but I have only shipped express a few times, and always pre-paid as they were legal items. I'm sure SR vendors can provide more input on this!
    <br/>

    I'm guessing you are using Express Flat Rate envelopes? They -should- be okay in a blue box. Also, if you are using stamps, it CANNOT be dropped in a blue box if it is OVER 13 ounces. They are pretty strict on this rule in my area. Pre-paid is fair game, but stamped will get returned to sender. I've only ever brought express to a postal worker, however. Good luck, and sorry I don't have more exact info for ya!

    realXimpact pretty much has it down.  If you are sending contraband through the mail you will want to stay away from using the Expressmail(as well as Priority/First Class)printing options available from usps.com or stamps.com that require electronic payment. The only practical option for Express labels is the form the PO provides.  If you wanted to you could use a typewriter to pound out the label info but doing that regularly would make it way easy to profile your pkgs.  Regarding the signature waiver...generally no one wants to have to sign for pkgs, yea.  Be sure to pull out the "customer copy" so you have a record of the tracking number and how the label was written.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as dropping Express mail...they can be dropped in any PO blue box,  just be sure to have correct postage.  They sell Express stamps at any PO. (currently $18.95) You can also use any combination of stamp denominations that add up to $18.95.  You mentioned drop boxes at Post Offices.  You'd be better off using boxes that are out of range from CCTV cameras.  Also, any class of mail can be dropped in the PO's blue drop boxes.  There are still some Express Mail blue boxes around that are for Express pkgs only but I'm pretty sure the PO is fazing them out so they are becoming  less and less visible.  As mentioned make sure the pkgs weigh 13 ounces or less.  The 13 Ounce Rule isn't universally enforced but you don't want to take that chance.  Even if you handed it off to a PO clerk who overlooked the rule it can still get snagged by mail handlers anywhere along it's journey ...and get RTS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advice is to stay away from Express shipments.  Expresses Mail is handled separately from all other classes of mail making it an easy target for Postal Police profiling.  If you read accounts of contraband being intercepted domestically you'll notice a high percentage of them are Express Packs.  Your shipment will blend in better if it is one of 10,000 pkgs as opposed to one of say 100 pkgs.
