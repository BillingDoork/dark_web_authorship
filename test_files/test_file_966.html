    I plan on putting up listings for cannabutter soon. However I am not sure how I should send it. I don't think it is a good idea to send it cold, because it might be suspicious when it it getting processed as to why something chilled it being sent via the post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know butter does last for a long time at room temperature, but would you want to receive butter at room temperature in the mail? I would vacuum seal it and ensure it was packaged well, but I want to get buyers opinions and suggestions about how best to send cannabutter in the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All suggestions will be appreciated

    How long butter will keep at room temp seems to change for everybody's view.  I've had the stuff keep for many months but others claim only a few weeks max.  The weed infusion may change that though.  As someone who has debated buying cannabutter several times, I wouldn't care if it arrives in room temp.  I'd be more concerned with actually receiving it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is only amateur advice, but be sure to not just vacuseal but use moisture barrier bags.  Plain vacuum seal bags still have micro-pores, enough to allow smell to come through.  It may take some time (a couple of days) but it'll still happen.  Read the sticky at the top of Shipping to understand about that.

    You should just take the extra step and use the butter for edibles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then it will be easier to ship and you can put some kind of note like "here are some cookies, love mom" and it will look legit.

    Thanks everyone who replied.
    <br/>
    I'm thinking I will just package it very well and send it at room temperature.

    Freeze it, vacuum seal it, ship it, and when it arrives tell the person to freeze it before opening it.  ;)

    Yea I think that is what I'll do. That way it stays in the same shape while in transit.

    During the summer months those postal sorting centers can be pretty warm, not to mention the trucks baking in the sun.  I know you can order dippin' dots through the mail, and they use special containers with dry ice.  Not saying you need to go THAT far, but just saying, those sorting centers are usually not air conditioned and the trucks can get pretty damn hot.
