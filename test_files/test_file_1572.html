    SWIM has been using a private mail box for the last three months, getting rather large packages both domestically and internationally without problem over the course of 8500 dollars spent. Just recently, SWIM ordered a gram of DMT locally which was shipped express. That was 8 days ago. I think it's safe to assume it's not showing up. How ridiculous that of all the packages, including ones upwards of 100 grams of molly or 1 pound of mushrooms, it would be a Gram of DMT that is seized. Though I can't prove it was, I imagine SWIM would have to assume and burn the address, no? Anyone continued to get packages to an address where this happened?

    You don't have to use the acronym SWIM here. If it's no biggie changing your drop address then it might be an idea to do so especially if you get big amounts sent non the regular. Just curious though- how do you know it was seized?

    If your in the USA and you don't get either the item, a customs seizure notice, or a pair of handcuffs, guess what?

    That's the other thing. I don't know for sure if the stuff was even seized. I'm in the US, I received 3 grams of DMT from another vendor just the other week just fine. I would be thrilled to find the vendor is just being a lazy fuck and hasn't sent the stuff yet, because then I could keep the box and just wouldn't deal with the vendor again. He claims it was sent first class 9 days ago, but I also read a post from an ex postal inspector who said if small amounts of illegal substances are found in an envelope, they are removed and the envelope is still sent with a seizure notice inside. But I have yet to receive ANYTHING. Makes me think, perhaps it was only lost if it was actually sent . . .

    It WAS domestic but if I said it was express, I misspoke. It was first class which should take only 3-6 days. Here's a question: If it doesn't show and I do have to burn the addy (which is looking to be the case; HUGE bummer) wouldn't the new one need to be under a new fake name as I assume were my box to be flagged it wouldn't be the box, but the name it was registered too?? Such a burn.
