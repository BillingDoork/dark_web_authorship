    Is there a difference between buying Express shipping and buying Stealth Express shipping?
    <br/>
    There shouldn't be a difference. I don't think I should have to pay extra for stealth, do you?

    did you consider it's possible that the vendor charges extra for "super stealth" in the instance that you're ordering with a higher risk of having your mail tampered with (neighbor gets your packages sometimes, family may open it, crazy girlfriend...etc) and you just need that extra insurance if opened, you're probably okay?

    It depends on the vendor.  I use a vendor that charges a bit more for "stealth", but it's because there is a bit more work that is involved than usual.  His normal packs are pretty stealth already, but sometimes as dude above me has stated..  You need a few more layers of security for whatever reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor that I am referring to, I would pay a bit extra for the stealth because the chances of the pack being fucked with by anyone is so damn slim..  And I want to make sure that those particular goods make it here safe and fucking sound!

    Yeah I think I'll go with the "Super Stealth" just to be on the safe side.

    Depending upon the product(s), a well packed USPS Express is usually OK.  Personally, I will not do Express mail due to the increased visibility when sending it.

    A well packed/secured Priority mailing will get thru fine 99.9% of the time, same goes for anything Express.  Express will just have a faster guaranteed delivery window, and point-by-point tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stealth (mostly) only applies only if the mail gets destroyed and contents exposed OR if, for some reason, your mailing is placed under increased scrutiny, warrant ordered, executed...etc.

    What kind of visibility? For the vendor or for the buyer?

    @CGM, I'm just talking in vague terms, the visibility of the package thru the USPS chain of custody.  There aren't as many Express packages as the rest, hence I postulate that more of the same sets of eyes view and (possibly inspect, if something is afoot) Express packages.
