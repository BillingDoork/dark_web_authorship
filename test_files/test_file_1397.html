    I noticed one HUGE omission from USPS tracking today. I guess I never noticed before because I've never used tracking in a situation where trust and fraud can potentially be a real issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it possible to confirm the DELIVERY ADDRESS of a package with USPS tracking?? It seems a really basic part of tracking a package, but I guess USPS figures 99.99% of shipments don't have this kind of potential for fraud since one could simply go to the BBB to report it. On the other hand, it would still be very useful even for legit shipments just to be able to confirm that the delivery address ended up being correctly labeled without typos or anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason I ask is that I may end up having to FE for a certain vendor due to rare circumstances and I would be much more comfortable doing so under the conditions that they could ship my item that same day and provide a tracking number. Then I realized that I am unable to find any way to confirm the address an item is being delivered to until it is actually delivered! Therefore, I might run into the problem of this vendor defrauding me by sending me some tracking number, probably one that heads in my general direction of the U.S. and looks all good, until it suddenly ends up in Bumfuck, Ohio.
