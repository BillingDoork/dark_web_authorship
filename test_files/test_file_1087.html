    I just moved to Spain a couple of months ago and dont know much about the customs here. Anyone know if  its hard to get drugs into Spain?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And hows the Postal service in Spain? Ive heard it can be very slow..    I also noticed I had misspelled my name on an order. Was pretty drunk when I did the order...  I dont know how it works in Spain. Do they have to deliver mail even though the name dont completly match? I know in some countries they have to deliver the post to the adress written on the envelope, even though the name is misspelled or even if its completly wrong name. Does this apply to Spain aswell?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any feedback on this is much appreciated!

    Hi,i think Spain its one of the safest country if you order from EUROPE,maybe flagged countries as Holland are the most dangerous,but i did a buy of cocaine without problems.Also i buyed a lot of Research chemicals from UK and Holland without any problems.A lot  of Research chemicals were in  a "grey area" in spanish laws,MDVP for example its not a controlled susbstance in Spain so many others,only was a problem if you harm people or sell it with high and lucrative intentions.So a lot of Rc, distributors moved to Spain due spanish laws.There is a shop,that sell RCs as collectionable items,so go figure.

    Postal maybe slow,depends the zone you live in,near great cities its fast.If the adress its correct,im sure they deliver it,also if do not match the name,but you can ask the postal man if you have the possibility.
