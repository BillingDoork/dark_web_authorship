    Hey all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously thinking about making a purchase through Silk Road. If I were to go through with it, what do people generally do? Give a fake name?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm also unsure about using my own address, but I don't even know if there are PO boxes to rent here. What have the other UK'ers done?

    Im no expert, only a noob whos just started reading, but heres how i understand it: i think people tend to use a variation on their own name and most will risk shipping to their own address, the variation on your name will give you plausible deniability.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in the uk there are companies like 'mailboxes etc' from whom you can rent a postal address (its not technically a po box) ive spoke to them about it and you can use their address but make it look residential with your mailbox number (less suspicious to customs i guess)...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    eg instead of: mailbox 112, mailboxes etc 25 church street
    <br/>
    you could use flat 112, 25 church street
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you need a passport to open an account but they accept a faxed copy of your PP (lol)

    unless you're ordering ounces of mandy just get it sent to your home address. if it's small amounts of powder or weed your order will almost invariably come vacuum packed in an envelope so no need to sign for anything- use a fake name. if you're cohabiting with less tolerant parents, housemates or partners, tell them a friend had something mailed to your address while they're abroad or use a plausible typo of your name, Smith - Schmidt or whatever. bigger packages (mushrooms, larger orders of things) always arrive in those A5 jiffy bags. sometimes it ends up at the local Royal Mail depot. never pick it up in person if you get a red slip through the door, get them to redeliver. with UK to UK orders, dont even bother with a name, just give your address../
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've put in literally dozens of orders and never had a problem. I never order from the US and split up larger orders over several days.

    Don't use anybody else's name. When's the last time somebody else opened your post? Never. FoaF ordered using a previous tenants name thinking he was really fucking clever; turned out one of the other flats was forwarding on her post, opened the package since the previous tenant didn't know what it was, found drugs, rang police. They didn't get busted but if they'd just used their own fucking name there would have been no issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plausible deniability doesn't mean shit in the UK. If they actually care (ounces of MDMA etc.) they will seize all your computers and fuck you like that. Name on the envelope isn't shit to the police.
