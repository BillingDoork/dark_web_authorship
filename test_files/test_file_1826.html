    hey guys, i love what i have recently got into, this online market and its ways take much violence out of the buisness and in my opinion less risky than local transactions and i am just grateful to be apart of something so underground and unique.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    okay from the info i have gathered im trying to get weight of bud, like a pound+ or what have you, and bascially venders say use your own adress, sr site says never use where you keep it, i dont really trust any friends enough with that kind of money so im thinkin like......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.O box....obtain 2 fake identifications [i.d and what else?" put it under a company with technology parts (computers use adheasive for parts and are fragile so etc} and ill pick it up at a 24/7 one? which i have never even heard of.....none of this is worth getting snagged so i like to plan and shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is my plan, please clear some things u with your advice and if im being a fuck head....cyberslap me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks! :o

    Don't overthink the delivery aspect of this thing to the exclusion of everything else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The weak point in the whole transaction is the delivery point.  You must at some point physically possess the package or it does you no good.  Fake IDs, PO boxes, vacant mailboxes, and aliases will only obfuscate the obvious, not shield you from prosecution or protect you from being charged.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are ever charged, there are really only a few very simple details you need to have worked out...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Have a good attorney
    <br/>
    2) Be absolutely positive that there is NO OTHER EVIDENCE that can be used to prove you had ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AT ALL of the contraband that was mailed to you.  Nothing in your house.  Nothing on your computer.  Nothing on your phone.  NOTHING AT ALL.  You should also make sure your home is clean of any other drugs/paraphernalia.
    <br/>
    3) Keep your mouth shut.  Do not deny anything, do not offer any explanation at all.  Just shut up and lawyer up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fake names and addresses won't help your cause.  False identification and PO boxes obtained with such credentials won't help either, but they will give the feds something else to charge you with, and the evidence they need to convict you, too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This whole thing works because the USPS processes roughly 200,000,000,000 pieces of mail annually- that's about 20,000,000 pieces of mail per HOUR.  Don't make it more complicated than it needs to be.

    At a point in time I was asking the same question. Keep looking through the forums because this same thing has been asked and answered TONS of times, all of them containing good info.
    <br/>
    When it comes down to it I would say use your REAL name!
    <br/>
    If you think about it, it really wouldn't make sense to use a fake name. If you get caught...well YOU GET CAUGHT! Now would you want to get caught with your real name or with your fake name? The PO box form (as with many many other forms) it says right on it that all information must be your real info on it. What happens if you get caught with a fake name? They pull up that sheet and throw it in your face. Niceeee now you just got yourself a new federal charge. When you could have just (maybe) gotten a slap on the wrist and 6 months probation for ordering that 1/2 oz of weed.
    <br/>
    Also from what Ive read itd be easier to escape from the law (I'm talking all US based here) by shutting up indeed and "not knowing about that package". Some crazy fucking ebay seller must of gotten his drug shipments and his comic book collection he sells mixed up lol.
