    I ordered a few tabs off him on Friday..marked in transit by saturday morning.....WAITING SUCKS! Does anyone have experience ordering tabs from the vendor Righteous? Approximately how long did it take until you received your stuff? Do you think it could come tomorrow if its 3-6 days shipping?? Anxious lol.

    Righteous is the man.  Shipping is quick. If marked in transit saturday you should have it by tuesday or wednesday if you live out in the boondocks.  And if you look at his vendor page you will see that LOTS of people have ordered from him, and been very happy.  So dont stress it your in good hands

    Yea dude, relax. He's the #1 NBOMe vendor I believe, so you have nothing to worry about. I've ordered from him multiple times and it's always come in under 4 days.

    A 300+ purchase vendor with 99% good rep selling a product which is legal in the vast majority of places. Stop freaking out. Take a xanax and quit the amphetamines.

    Hello my fellow Psychonauts!
    <br/>
    I just thought you should know that we (Silo) offer better prices than 'Righteous' does with his 25i and we also sell very high quality 25c-NBOMe and LSD. Try us out. Right now we are running a special on our NBOMe products where  1 out of every 5 orders will have their order tripled in quantity! so if you order 900 tabs and your name is drawn (which we do publicly on our review board)...you will receive 2700tabs! and if its not drawn you still get the amount you ordered at the same low prices we offer! We offer both small and large quantity listings in order to meet the needs of the user just looking for a personal amount and to supply those of you looking to cash in on bulk orders so that you can cash in and resell our items! Communication and customer satisfaction is our number one priority! If you aren't already a customer we hope that you are willing to take advantage of the special we are running and allow us to become your go to vendor from now on!
    <br/>
    aso if you post on our forum review page or reddit fan page we will increase your order by 50% or more !

    i have had only one experience with righteous, ordered a fair amount of his 25i a while ago and it came in 3 or 4 days. stealth was more than sufficient for tabs, especially domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    nice product too, many people enjoyed them. art was ok.

    great vendor though you shouldn't have anything to worry about.

    Righteous is the man, and you will get your order. Be patient, it will be there before you know it. I've ordered from him a couple times, and each time he gave me double my order for free. :D
