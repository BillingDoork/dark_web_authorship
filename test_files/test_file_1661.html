    So about three years ago I was sending weed weekly through the post. Before i knew about SR. My friend received a letter one time from HMRC. I saw him not to long ago and we were laughing about it. In said letter it stated that his package of "Herbal Marijuana" had been seized and if he wished to collect it then he needed to contact HMRC, if not it would be destroyed. Has anyone else had this? Also has anyone had the audacity to try and collect.

    Have seen the same customs letter but for a different country and it does invite you to collect what was confiscated but that you could be arrested because it was an unlawful product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wonder how many get a fright and actually call them about it or drop in to admit it was theirs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It happened to a friend and he rang a guy who knew what to do which was to burn the letter and act dumb if it went further.
