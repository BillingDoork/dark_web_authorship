    Well if it's a real address then it'll go back to that address and if the right person opens it they can just resend it. If it's a false address and it winds up on some Joe's door its hard to tell, you might get a friendly visit because someone got something and freaked out. More than likely though it'll just go back to the address and if it can't be delivered there then they'll eventually take it to storage or a disposal unit.
