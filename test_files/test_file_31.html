    Has anyone put through a few orders with vendors who don't expect you to FE and then the moment you do and 6 weeks later and still nothing has come and you get told Aussie customs but there's no notice in the mail from them.........From here on any vendor who wants me to FE i'll give them a 2/5 and the moment it arrives i'll update it to 5/5. Would anyone say that i'm been to much of a hardarse. Take into consideration i'm in my late 20's and all i want is to enjoy weekends with my wife and close friends, swingers i hear you say, oh no just young at heart.

    I'd say yeah you are being a hard ass
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't FE, PERIOD !!!  If that means you can't get gear, then that means you can't get gear.  I live in Canada so I know what it's like to be shut out by most of the SR vendors (though Aussies have it way worse), it's frustrating as fuck and there's a buncha stuff I can't get access to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if you agreeably finalize early, you chose to do it.  Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only way i've been able to deal is with diligent patience, cuz eventually a vendor will pop up with what I want that will ship to me in my whacky 'international' country Canada without FE.  Build up a REALLY good buyer profile and many vendors are flexible on FE if you can prove your honesty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This whole post is sort of hypocritical because I have my own policy requiring certain users to FE, but it's because us vendors can get screwed just as easily as you.  Especially if a buyer with 0/0% places an order.  Too many scammers, it's too easy to create a shill account, order a bunch of stuff, and then demand either through resolution centre or through personal threats to the vendor that the vendor re-imburse the scammer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So yeah, I don't like FE, won't FE on purchases I make, but completely understand why vendors ask certain buyers to FE.  Also, some buyer's irresponsibly finalize a week in or so (before receiving their package) cuz they anticipate it will be there any day, thus defeating the entire purpose of escrow.

    What do you mean they sent you a 'sus order'? was it underweight? not what you ordered? fake gear? covered in fingerprint dust with it's own personal police escort?

    Don't FE, that's the only solution. If you have minimal transaction stick to the vendors with best feedback FE with them then when you have developed a history stop FE completely.

    Sounds like you need to improve your stats OP. Without knowing how much you've done, if you're still in the single digit transation area, you might get lucky as soon as you hit 10+!
    <br/>
    Try and go for a few small, local transactions and build up a good transaction record. OS vendors will see you're a reliable and trustworthy buyer and most won't ask to FE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FTR and a bit of a gloat, I've not been asked to FE for a while now, since mid feb (i think)! Even from vendors who say "All intl orders must FE"!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I have sent funds over before they auto-finalise after 17 days, thinking that it'll arrive any day now, only lost 1 item so far!

    Hey OP,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am really sorry to hear that. That is some situation. I started as a Vendor last month and never asked or gotten any FE orders. I tend to think escrow is a value tool due to the nature of our business and the types of people who are involved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can send me your SR User Name, I would like donate $5.09 to you because I feel for you. I hope this resolves it self and you get your package and a free donation :p
