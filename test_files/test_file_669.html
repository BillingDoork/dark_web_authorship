    If its for a PO Box then you will need a fake license and utility bill.
    <br/>
    Make sure whatever you have ordered will fit into the box you have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But other than that, unless you can find a certain business...which you can easily access their mail box, etc...i wouldnt know. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try a dummy run if you havent gone the fake license route to whatever drop location you have chosen...then see how you go. ;)

    Cheers for your response jnemonic. I don't think the fake PO box is an appropriate method though as I believe some packages require a signature and that would just rule this right out.

    I think that is a whole lot of to much.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just stick with trusted vendor's,  I think if u do all that other stuff your just asking for packages getting lost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my 2 cents.

    I would think most people would figure this stuff out prior to spending $14k and arranging a $25k deal... :/

    I feel ya. :)

    Brainstorming can definitely help.  Just keep in mind, we're keeping a log of our discussion and laying it out where our enemy can see our thoughts and plans.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most of the things I've gathered from the forums I've taken many things people have said and extrapolated on them so as to keep my security above and ahead of the rest of the pack and LE's attention. ;)
