    Scammer offer's %0 to me even he already has %25 for first time orders %50 for regular customers refund option on his page
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He offers %0
    <br/>
    I offered %50
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I didnt accept his offer and he didnt accept mine too.
    <br/>
    After 22 hours it will be automaticly due in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dont deal with anyone about refund before so i am not sure what kind of result i will get , is there anything can i do or need to do before auto due in time ( dealing with scammer is not an option because he dont like answer any kind of messages.) also dont have tracking number too
    <br/>
    Waiting for your adviced before due date
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regards.

    What did you just say?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How is he a scammer, if he says 0%, then you will probably get 0%...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take it into resolve?

    In the Resolution Center, if he didn't agree with your 1st proposal and you didn't agree with his, submit a new resolution and make sure it's what you want back from the transaction. If he then doesn't agree with you, SR will make a decision on behalf of you both.

    if what you've described is true it doesn't look good for the vendor if he provides no evidence he shipped your item SR should come down on your side I don't know if they'll come to 50% if the vendor states 25% for new buyers but if you haven't finalized yet I don't see how they could rationalize giving him full payment if he can't prove he sent you anything.  Hope it works out in your favor let us know how it pans out for you

    <br/>
    clickbang- Even though the info on his vendor page might say, 25% refund for 1st time orders, if he cannot prove that he sent you anything, you should get 100%.  Because if that is the case, he might never send out any product to customers and always plan on keeping 75% of the BTC; unless they go to SR Resolution like yourself.  It appears that English might not be your 1st language, so feel free to copy and paste this to SR Resolution if I have described your situation correctly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And- let us know how it turns out and who the vendor is so we can prevent this from happening to someone else.  ;)
