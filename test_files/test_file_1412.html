    Do not order it international.  Those fuckers are heavy!  You should have it broken down into parts and even then the biggest single piece is still fucking heavy...

    I don't think the one you linked is in the US.  That is why is probably why it says undeclared.  Have taken apart and shipped in pieces domestically and you should be fine.

    bulk is all i want and the break is not much from these people. I would be all over 800 a zip, if there was enough i would be doing the same thing as you. Love all the fake BS that kids are eating these days, i blew some minds at edc handing out freebies to randoms. Seems like people have never tasted mollys true insides these days. My hunt continues for now.  ;)

    So you must have been the one i heard at EDC dumping jars inside and handing the freebies out? :o
    <br/>
    people around us in these 2 states dont know what its like and when i give them real molly they dont like it because "its too heavy or doesnt seem right" to them.
    <br/>
    keep on looking and youl find it buy it wont be as good as ours in the road but it will keep up with it i will tell you that! :)

    Haha thats awesome because that WAS me. I always put my personal stuff in vials for festivals. dump on hand, lick and drink water, repeat many many times. When someone looked at what i was doing i would call em over and give em all a freebie. Have to spread the love. i got hit up all the time and all i heard was " that was the best molly i have ever had, can i buys some?" sure kiddies if you want, some i sold it too but most i just bumped em and said happy trails.

    Yea i know if i keep looking i will eventually find what i am looking for,  my luck is not holding out right now, 3 packs are no show without love letter  :-[ New to my local so sourcing is a bit of an issue. Have to hit a few festivals around here and meet some peeps.

     good work! i was told to come up and bring supplies but couldnt make it in time because of work. work sucks boo! :-[
     <br/>
     but i believe in good karma when you give others help when it comes to this stuff. give it some time and it should come to you man!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     also if i ever get ahold of this press youll know it will be me when its out! it will be the most original and fresh press.

    Looking forward to it, I will keep my ear to the ether and wait. Some good press would be very nice if available. got burned hard recently on a bad BS deal. recovery mode and hunting hunting. Good things to those that wait.
    <br/>
    Hopefully before Noc i will be good

    Got a 50G in processing and debating another before vaca mode. I think he is my going to be my goto guy for Sr mandy. Too much good feedback and escrow is very nice.Want to hit a larger order but still very on the fence about such big shipments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No shit about the press tho, BT's were my big hit on a boat,everything i hear about is garbage and we are supposed to be flooded with goodies. where i ask, where? Its getting to be tiring looking for a solid connect for press. Ive had a few great batches but that stopped before EDC and has not changed at all. Mandy is around but expensive with who i know and i wont pay anymore then 8-9 a zip period. Maybe i will trip and fall on "The guy" and a festival  ;D ....stranger things have definitely happened

    i would hit him up for more because a few more raves are comming in hot!!!
    <br/>
    i ordered 50 the first time to test him out but you should have no problem at all with larger orders. his stealth made me laugh when i opened it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    l sent you a message about those prices that you want and some on the boat for fire pressed new line just came out around here.

    Not enough feedback and you cannot see what the feedback is for.  Be careful,  tablet press is a big deal to the DEA...

    I don't have any help.  eBay has them sometimes and they are legit but there are records of those transactions so you need a good burner eBay account and drop.  You don't want one shipped international.  The biggest solid piece is still very heavy once it's been taken apart.
