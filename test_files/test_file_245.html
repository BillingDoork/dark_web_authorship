    I just recently started working at a ma and pa shop and have become cool enough with the owners that they feel comfortable with me getting packages sent there. I've been getting them sent to my house for awhile and feel relatively safe doing so, but I want to start being safer about where I get it sent to nonetheless. I was wondering if there were any laws concerning packages being sent to bussinesses compared to being sent to private residences that could have potential to dick me over somewhere down the road.

    What if your boss opens it up on accident?  Or asks what it is for and says "Oh, cool, an ipod touch!!  I want to see it!  Go ahead and open it, we can help you set it up!"  Seems like a bad idea to me.

    I think the betrayal of trust would completely turn them against you in that eventuality = pressing charges.

    Also packages sent to your own address that other people know about are much more plausibly deniable. How many people could know to send you anything to that business you haven't been working at forever?
