    Hey guys...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wanted to share this, this is a neat way to store small amounts of products in mylar for next to nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Capri Sun pouches are made of food grade mylar and sealable using an clothes iron or hair straighter. Mylar is very good for sealing stuff, hiding odors etc.
    <br/>
    Preppers  and survivalists use mylar (big bags, gallon sized) to store wheat, corn and other food stuffs for tens of years, using an oxygen absorber(optional) etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How to proceed
    <br/>
    1. Buy Capri Sun or other drinks that come in pouches
    <br/>
    2. Drink it
    <br/>
    3. Carefully cut the bag open from the upper side, just below the punching hole for the straw.
    <br/>
    4. Clean the pouch using warm soapy water, make it nice and clean. You only need to wash the remaining sugary contents away, it's very clean already
    <br/>
    5. Dry it, but keep it away from strong heat sources (don't use an hair dryer or put them on the rooms heating unit)
    <br/>
    6. Put in the contents, try to get rid of as many oxygen in the bag
    <br/>
    7. Seal it using an straighter or iron.
    <br/>
    8. Send it, store it, do what ever you want with it. You can store LSD very good this way, because the aluminum liner of the bag (that gives it metallic where no logo etc is) reflects all light. Dump LSD bag in freezer for added preservation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will post pics if interested.

    great idea, something similar came across my mind not that long ago.
    <br/>
    great minds think alike)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    however, spotting camouflaging methods on this forum open to many kind of people including DEA, etc. wouldn't benefit any of us..
    <br/>

    p.s. hopefully after this comment pigs wont break into my house rushing to my fridge to check every frozen pizza and milk cartons for my stash  :D :D

    I'm not really telling where to hide it, just educating how to preserve your goods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That LSD likes to be cold is general drug knowledge.
