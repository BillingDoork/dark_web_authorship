    I have ordered many packages from SR and never had a problem, postman always leaves the package in my mailbox. I ordered from a vendor last week and vendor assured me that pack would definitely fit in my mailbox. When the postman came today, it was a new postman who i have never seen before. He asked me if "John Doe" (obviously not his real name) was home. I asked why and he said "i have a package for him". so i told the postman i'll take the package and give it to him. He said only John Doe can take it if John Doe has ID and only then John Doe can have the package if he signs for it..
    <br/>
    i asked the postman why and he said the package was registered mail. He gave me a USPS peach slip and told me to give it to John Doe. On the peach slip it said it was a parcel and it was registered mail and that John Doe can pick it up at the post office. Has anybody ever heard of a package being registered mail? I thought that was for envelopes only and that for packages it was called signature confirmation? Should i be worried?? And yes John Doe's name is on the lease of the address and he gets mail/packages every day including this day.

    Registered Mail is usually used when the sender wants more insurance coverage than the standard $50 included with Priority Mail. It can be used on a letter or a parcel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be highly unusual for a vendor to use it, and if they did, for whatever reason, I'd think it would be clearly stated in their profile.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, anything's possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's most likely that John Doe, just happens to be getting a Parcel that has been sent Registered Mail, at the same time you're expecting your Silk Road package. - There is always the chance a mistake was made along the chain of command. Wrongly checked box, or wrongly entered info on USPS computer, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Usually you can see what zip code it came from, also the peach slip should have an item number that is trackable.  So you can see exactly where it was mailed from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have you thought of asking the vendor about it? At least if they can give you the zip code you can expect to see on the package? This shouldn't be incriminating, as we all get to see where our packages originate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope this helps.

    the tracking number on the pink slip matches the tracking number that the vendor gave me, however there seems to be a 2nd tracking number on the pink slip. But when i typed it in usps tracking, both tracking numbers seemed to have the exact same info, origin points and what days and times it was moved to sorting facilities and all. also the 2nd number is a Registered mail tracking #. is it possible to have 2 different tracking numbers for the same package?

    That's starting to sound a little "Yikes" to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have you asked the vendor about the "registered" part?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also what (if you don't mind sharing) were you getting? - feel free to PM me. - Let's just say,  Was it personal usage amounts? Domestic?

    fuckk this is so annoying. has anybody experienced  a CD or knows about CD's that can tell me if this sounds like one?
    <br/>
    I rescheduled a redelivery online, and i wrote in the additional comments that if no one is home to please leave it in the mailbox or leave it on the porch if it doesnt fit.
    <br/>
    Would this redlivery work for "registered mail" ?

    the part that really annoys me about this is that i specifically asked the vendor 3 times before i ordered (once in a PM on the market site, once in a PM on the forums and once on his review page) to make sure that i would definitely NOT need to ever sign for his domestic package and he assured me all 3 times that there is never a signature required for domestic packages and that is the reason i ordered from him! and now he is saying that his partner may have put signature required on the package but he is not sure?
    <br/>
    I'm not trying to scam anyone but this whole thing is real upsetting to me. this has never happened to me in 75+ orders on SR. I dont know if i should ask for a refund or just take a 900 dollar loss here..

    Don't take the loss if the vendor promised one thing and gave another. The going online to give them permission to drop it seems like it may solve the problem. Perhaps if there's a note section, put (waive signature) if you didn't already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You shouldn't have to take a loss over something you were more than adamant about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1st see if they just drop it off, now that you made the change to the delivery instructions. (pretend you're not home when the mailman comes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This kind of thing is so frustrating. I wish I was there, I'd go pick it up for you,  :D - Not that I'd want what's in there, but more to show that nothing's going to happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep posted what develops, perhaps next mail delivery, it will just be left with regular mail . You could reinforce your online request, and make s sign for your mailbox, saying "OK to leave packages requiring signature" - I wont be around to receive it - Thank you.
    <br/>

    Something like that.

    This seems very risky,  and obviously does not seem to be shipping as expected.
    <br/>
    Just forget about this package, clean up the home,  watch video on "don't talk to police" several times
    <br/>
    and ignore anyone unexpected coming to your door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you "encounter the postman", just say that JD isn't expecting anything registered and doesn't want it.
    <br/>
    If they want to talk more, shut up and request lawyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck and keep us informed on developments.

    registered mail is the most restrictive type of mail in the USPS system. I asked a postman once about it when somebody was trying to serve me court papers for a lawsuit. Registered mail is used either when sending something very valuable through the mail or when serving someone court papers. If someone accepts registered mail and signs for it and it happens to be court papers, then the person is considered to have been served. The mailman told me that often with registered mail the mailman asks for ID (and signature obviously) to verify that the recipient is in fact the person that the package was intended for. Registered mail can NEVER be delivered without a signature even if you explicitly give the mailman permission to do so. Registered mail is a whole new level up from signature confirmation or any other post requiring a siganture.

    What sofish said, I've sent registered mail a few times to the court in my city, just for the documents to be officially received. It costs a tiny bit extra so I don't see how he could 'accidentally' get registered mail.. Isn't this something you should be discussing with him further though? I doubt they'll just leave it, maybe you can have your friend just get it since it's in his name and say he has no clue what it is, along with plausible deniability - clean your house of substances and computer of SR, or just forsake it and escalate it since the vendor screwed up.

    do you mean to say cost "alot" extra, because when i looked it up it says a first class package weighing 10 oz is $2.75 but registered first class starts at $12, and goes up if you add insurance or if it has weight

    i went to the vendors review page where i had clearly asked the vendor if i had needed to sign and he answered "signature never rquired for domestic orders" and now i see he erased his own post saying that sig is never required for domestic packs :(

    can SR see posts that were erased and if so is there a time limit of how long they can see it after its erased?

    I would stop using all drugs if an SR vendor is using registered mail. As mentioned above, registered is for providing enough proof of delivery for it to stand up in court. I have no advice as to what to do, but can't believe a vendor would use this type of service.

    Sounds like a case of the 100% refunds to me. Should definitely be refunded your money and find a new drop to use, no reason some vendor should accidently check a box and now its your problem, return to sender and refund!
