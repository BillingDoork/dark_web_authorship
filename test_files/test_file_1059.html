    I have had some difficulties ordering some substances here, and to minimize my risks of being cought in the future, what substances are the safest to ship? To not to be detected by dogs/machines. I have heard that LSD is very safe to ship, but got second thought after my friend ordered some here, but they never arrived. Some do say Ecstacy pills are safe to ship, (Me and my friend have ordered 3 times now, two came through).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas appreciated,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance!

    It depends on where here is. All most all drugs should be safe for shipping as long as the vendor has taken the correct amount of precaution in sealing and concealing the product. LSD should be the safest but if it had been packaged improperly than it may send out a red flag. So I would do some research with the actual vendor. Ask them if they had a problem sending to your location, and ask them how safe their packaging is. Also look at their feedback. Sometimes customers will actually put good information in there.

    If you're worried enough about shipping to base your drug habits around what's safest, you may want to just look into research chemicals that are legal (or shall I say "legal") in your area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise, follow anonaddict's advice and research the vendor and his/her policies. Package inadequacies are a much bigger factor than contents.

    Yeah, I am familiar with RCs and have tried, the ones I tried include 2-CB and 25i-Nbome, didn't really like those, and also that you don't really know what's inside those chemicas and what they do to your body. I am more for the MDMA/LSD/Cocaine sort of guy. They are nice and familiar, but tend to get stuck pretty frequently. I think I'll just stick to LSD, as with coke and mdma (and ecstacy) they tend to get stuck at a 8/10 ratio
