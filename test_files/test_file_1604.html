    Hey,
    <br/>
    So I just talked to a buddy of my I haven't seen in a while at a party. I asked him what he was doing and he said a FedEx worker inside the warehouse. I immediately thought to ask him about suspicious packaging and people sending drugs, sounding out of curiosity. He said he sees a lot of packages that seem to obviously contain 'illegal' products. He also stated that he sees various out in the open fake names on the return and senders address. He said (i think off the top of his head) people use the stupidest names even like youdont knowme. So I said to him if you think there's some goods in a package (due to suspicious packages and obvious fake names) why don't you grab some for yourself? He told me that there's security and his managers watch him constantly. He needs to go through metal detectors when walking in and out of the building even. That prevents him from handling the packages improperly and stealing.
    <br/>
    One time there was a big ass box that fell off and opening up on the conveyer belt he was handling and it was FULLL of iphone 4s's. He was about to jack one in a second he said but theres cams and security everywhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just figured I share this info even if its nothing much. Figured its good news to hear EVEN FedEx could pass tons and tons of 'mail goodies'. Even saw feedback of a bad weed dealer on here and it said that this seller shipped via UPS and didn't even vacuum seal it at all. The buyer said that it smelt outside the box too! And even that passed by. WOW
    <br/>
    To think that these private company's could go ahead and open packages for slightest suspicion but yet the don't. And even better USPS needs a warrant! Ahhh USA rights are awesome. Fuckers keep trying to take it away but glad we still got our independence here!

    Obviously, it`s a chaos, all in all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is why I am not too much paranoid about LEO, but rather paranoid about the guys in the post office. They are just feckless and irresponsible bums, not giving a sh** if the letter is lost, or delivered to a wrong address, or whatever. The delivery rate in my country could have been 100%, if it were not for the careless postal slobs.

    Haha yup, I have friends that work in both UPS/USPS and they tell me they kick the shit out of every box that says "fragile" on it. It's hard to steal stuff smaller than an ipod but that's all they ever steal is ipodsÂ  :D those bastards
