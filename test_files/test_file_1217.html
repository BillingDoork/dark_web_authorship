    At first I was going to just get something shipped to my living addy, but now I have been thinking that's not such a good idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't live on my own, I live with someone who has felonies on their record from decades ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was contemplating a friends house, but then the package would have to be in their name, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any suggestions how to go about getting a drop addy?

    You could always get a Private Mailbox through UPS, or a P.O box.  For larger shipments you can get a P.O. Box that's 11x11 inches.

    Don't open a PO box solely for the purpose of receiving SR shipments unless you're willing to put at least a few weeks of work into it.  Unless you take the time to establish a presence there and order a decent amount of uninteresting packages, you'll just be getting additional attention without much additional protection (as it'll be in your name). And if you open the box using a fake ID, you've just committed not one serious federal crime, but two.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just get it shipped to yourself,  or if you feel like being a dick put your housemates name on it.  If its intercepted they'll think its obviously him, and in the time it takes for him to be convinced of his innocence youll have been able to delete your SR accounts and toss your computer into a lake. (If it does get there safely, though, you need to share the order with the felon in residence.)  Chances are itll get there just fine, though. Its unusual delivery addresses that tend to be a tipoff.

    While I agree that this is a good thing to do I would like to say that I rarely had anything besides drugs ever shipped to my over 80 PO boxes and some of them had seizure letters from CBP pretty often.  If you've never seen one, they clearly say they are from CBP on the top left of the envelope.  I had a seizure letter and a package of drugs, sometimes two packages, or a slip for a package with a letter most of the times that I got seizure letters because I was dealing with so many packages...  So yes I established a presence at my boxes, but it was all narcotic shipments.  Repeatedly receiving packages from the same places, looking the same, time and time again.  Checking various PO boxes used to be apart of my daily routine.

    This is the guy movies should be made about lol.
    <br/>

    As for OP i think your name (or his name) on a package/letter with some drugs in it now an then will not fuck any ones day up, find an alternate drop every now and then if possible maybe a PO box in your real name that you have most real shipments sent to and once and a while a SR order...

    I'm thinking about opening up a different po box.  Do you think it would be wise to close one before I open the other?  Keep in mind I plan on using the same info for the new one as the last one because I never had any problems with it.  I'm just trying to play it safe if you will and put my mind at ease.
