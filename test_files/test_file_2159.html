    So I know nobody wants to reveal to much info about themselves on here, so I'm not really expecting much response to this message, but anyway:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm pretty iffy about making a first purchase on SR. I'd like it to travel as little distance as possible. So if anyone can PM me and tell me they're a seller (weed) in the SE-QLD area I'd very much appreciate it.

    Hi justjam,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendors location doesn't matter too much as long as they are in Aus.

    <br/>
    Your travel distance is to your letter box :))

    Yeah Im with justjam on this. Id prefer it if it didnt have to travel a long distance , perth to sydney for example.  Surely mail going such distances passes through an airport and therefore possibly sniffer dogs.

    At this point you really don't have to worry much about domestic, wherever it's sent from. Probably not a good idea to reveal the city you live in, as you have just done in this thread.  Good luck dude.

    beat me too it but I think that part should be removed, and why post it really, commonsense ? or maybe a little bit more paranoia wouldn't go astray. Not having a dig at you but a few people on here doing it also.

    Thanks for the advise but at this stage telling me "no need to worry" doesnt really help. I want facts not consolation.  How does mail travel? does it got through airports? etc etc   Just cause its domestic doesnt mean it doesnt pass through airports.

    if you want to engage in any criminal enterprise, you are best to go fact finding yourself . Relying on a public forum is particularly daft .

    Any port is subject to security checks. ANY PORT

    Until you get your head around....life (by the looks of things) , stay away from potential jail terms and go look up these facts yourself.
