    So like the topic title says, I would like to become a vendor, but there are a few things I want to research before starting. I have already researched using Heat Sealed Mylar instead of vaccuum sealing, and I have bought a 6 Inch Direct Heat Sealer and a roll of 5mm Mylar sheet (althought it's rather small). The first question I would like to ask is where is a good place to buy the right kind of Mylar bags/sheets/rolls? Obviously I can cut them up to the size I want, but most of my packages will be rather small, so I'm not concerned about have a huge size. I read a lot of the topics on the Mylar/Heat Sealing stuff, but couldn't find a site with the kind of Mylar I need, and the vendors that were listed on SR either are out or don't sell them anymore (not too mention I'd rather buy it outside of SR because it would probably be cheaper).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other thing I would like to ask about is how to mail the packages out? How do I pay for postage anonymously (doesn't USPS have prepaid mailers as long as they fall within a certain weight) and how do I choose what kind of return address to use. What is the best way to make it look business-like? And then how do you mail it out, by using different drop boxes around the city? Basically what are the must-knows for protecting myself and my packages?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other advice that you could give would be appreciated. I want to be the kind of vendor that people respect and want to come back to because of stealth, speed, quality, etc. So the best way to do that would be to get some advice from those that use these methods themselves and buyers who want vendors to use these methods.

    If you're interested in becoming a vendor, you'll need to read the entire SR Wiki, in full, and read, read, read in the Shipping and Security forums:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SR Wiki:
    <br/>
    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also make a few orders from vendors shipping similar products that you wish to offer so you can get some ideas for stealthy packaging etc.

    I believe Jesus of Rave has several guides to vending, no idea how good they are but everything else he stocks is very good. Might be worth a look, sounds like (with the greatest of respect) you need to look into this a lot more and not on public forums. Just my thoughts on the subject never sold drugs in the real world let alone on here.

    Good luck be careful.

    The first few posters weren't very helpful at all. Instead of just telling me that I'm inept and not cut out for being a vendor, you could give me some advice (which is what I made this topic for), or possibly point me in the right topic or two that has good Info. I've read and re-read the seller's Guide over and over and it doesn't give much info on shipping methods.  To the other posters who weren't complete jackasses, thanks for trying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Research is exactly what I've been doing, constantly. I have already paid for my Vendor's account, but haven't made any listings (nor plan to), until I have every thing I need to know. I have bought address stickers for the return address and the sending address to avoid handwriting, and I have read some advice on creating return addresses. The advice I read basically said to choose an apartment complex and use the address without the Apt # part. And either use an alias or a business alias (and/or possibly a business address with a different business name). These are all just options up in the air right now. I am just looking for some of the best advice out there on these subjects. There are plenty of stickies on how to package drugs to keep them from getting intercepted, but not ver many on how to actually going about anonymously purchasing shipping, choosing return addresses, creating business-like envelopes/packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not going into this half-cocked. I am spending my time researching. I would not send out anything or list anything until I felt confident I can quickly do all these things and ship it out within a timely manner and have t get there on time with minimal chnce of interception. I've bought plenty of packages, so I have seen some pretty stealthy packaging, and the use of heal seal vs. vacuum seal, and have invested in a direct heat sealer, Mylar, and a bunch of other stuff. I just want to get this postage stuff figured out before I do anything. I want my packages to get to their destination, and I want to protect myself, my customers, and their items.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks to those who tried to help and thanks for any future assistance. I would like to start vending ASAP, as I need to recoup some losses, but I am willing to wait and play it safe until doing so.

    My guess as to why this happened is because Silk Road is filling up with new, marginal vendors who are under-capitalized and woefully unprepared to handle orders. They put buyers at risk with poor stealth packing, lack of encryption, and they just generally seem to not know what they don't know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And the endgame for these vendors is even worse, they usually break bad and try to initiate some FE scam to recoup their losses after they've realized that they can't compete honestly in here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It just ends badly for everyone involved, and I think that's why folks are telling you to stop and really think it over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You're asking questions that are so basic and readily available in the sellers guide that you simply give the impression of just another hapless noob vendor walking into a lions den. Nobody would care if it was just you that was at risk, but when you vend, you are responsible for keeping your customers SAFE as well, and lots of new vendors lately are failing miserably at this.

    For the return address, you can just use a fake name and real address that has the same ZIP code as the post office you're gonna be using. Using an apartment block address is a good idea too. And I'd recommend using letters/envelopes, so that you can just use stamps on them. Parcels are also more often intercepted than letters. If it's powder, then I would just use a business style letter, even though you can't really hide it inside.
