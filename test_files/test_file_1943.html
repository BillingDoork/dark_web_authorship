    Anyone know of a good method to get a small quantity of drugs through customs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking of putting a baggy inside another baggy with bits scraped off an incense stick inside the outside baggy, then filling it with cheap aftershave.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Afterwards, empty a shampoo bottle and superglue the baggy to the bottom of the bottle as flat as possible and then pour the shampoo back in...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone think this would be a good method?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take care people,

    Firstly, is it that important for you take the risk?
    <br/>
    If it is then it's up your ass in a condom. Or maybe in your mouth whilst you go through customs and swallowed (with water) if it gets risky.
    <br/>
    Both are tried and tested. But I repeat if it ain't worth it, don't risk it.

    It's got to be up the bum... Tried and tested! Try and make it into a torpedo shape, put in a condom but tie it off and trim off excess including the ring(on the condom!) grease it a little, shove it right up there. Don't worry it won't get stuck; your arsehole is excellent at expelling stuff (if you have a habit maybe not !) Or if you are a woman you might find your vagina more accommodating. I heard of a guy in prison storing his bosses mobile phone up his bumhole. I assume it was a small thin one. And he must have had it on silent.
    <br/>
    I gather from watching those customs programmes on TV that they have "sniffer" machines that test for traces of drugs so try and make sure you don't handle drugs before packing your case. Kind of tricky if you are a daily user but.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they do find traces your best hope would be to admit drug use ( as they keep searching till they find some reason) but deny having any with you, and hope they don't cavity search! You'll probably be able to walk straight through customs. Try not to look like you've got drugs up your bum.

    It also depends on your destination. There are certain countries you REALLY don't want to get caught smuggling into. On the other hand, if the drugs you are addicted to are legal with prescription, maybe just take them in blister packs openly in your luggage and act as if they are for a medical condition and plead ignorance if discovered.  " I didn't know I needed a doctors letter"
    <br/>
    Perhaps they'd just get confiscated if the worst happened.

    For a small amount of pills, just hold them in your hand when you walk through security. Of course, they will notice that you have pills in your hand. Tell them it's your prescription medication and it will be a non issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Source - Me. I travel a lot and do it all the time.  I'll palm 4 2mg Xanax and 4 30mg Adderall because I like to eat pills on the plane.  Though these are not really big-time illicit drugs, I wouldn't hesitate to palm other prescription medications or recreational drugs (MDMA etc) unless they are of a silly press.

    If the drugs are water soluble you could take a small perfume bottle, empty it + wash it and fill it with water and dissolve your drugs in the liquid. Works well with at least MDMA. Pay attention to the concentration of your solution (basic math). Use a cough syrup syringe (what ever those plastic things without the needle are called) and measure out the wanted dose and drink it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't know if this could work as I have never taken any drugs aboard with me. It's always somewhat Russian roulette.

    I have taken drug aboard and sent them this was. Make a candle when burning the wax put the baggies inside and wait for it to go hard. I used to do it.... My mate lives in oz and he wanted an oz of mephedrone. Went to a place where they sell 100 candles for like 1pound and burnt the wax and then put it back in the wax holder. I works fine 1gram in each

    If you know your destination address, you can also send the drugs by post to yourself before you leave your current country to receive them abroad. I think this would be the most hassle and risk free solution.

    Man, Please do not take most of the advice given here. Unless you like hanging from various structures, lethal injections, firing squads etc.
    <br/>
    Storing the goods in anything is plain idiotic. Backscatter, xray, and profiling, plus random bag searches and dogs make sure that it is highly likely that they will find your goods.
    <br/>
    Mailing the goods is the most hassle free.. the goods might get caught but you wont. If you must take it with you. Internal is the only way to go. Anal insertion is ok (although this cannot be proven I am of the opinion that backscatter and the other recent machine they use now (whose name eludes me and I cant be assed googling it so I appear smarter) can detect some internally stuffed or swallowed goods, and I am very keen to know more credible information concerning this topic)) however swallowing is safer (from a LE perspective but not from a health perspective) Take supplements before you swallow to help neutralize your stomach acids. You can use condoms. However I would be more inclined to dunk small grape sized parcels in a latex fondue and let them set. Small sizes are better. Easier to pass and harder to see in an xray (nothing will get past the ultrasound though if they decide to arrest you). Really it is a whole lot of headache. All places have a street scene. It might even be cheaper and better where you are going.
    <br/>
    Do not put pills in your hand, things in shampoo bottles, or home made candles, sure you might get through but you more than likely wont. Then how will your holiday be.
    <br/>
    Smuggling through airports is pretty slim pickings now man. the only people who normally do it are usually addicts who need a hit on the plane or when they get off at the other end or Economic desperados who have been paid peanuts by a cartel. Score when your there.

    If it were me, I would just mail them to myself at the destination address ahead of time. If it's a private address, then it wouldn't be a problem and if it's a hostel/resort or something like that, you could just communicate with the lobby clerk ahead of time that you will need to receive a package during your stay (ask them for instructions on how the package should be addressed and they will hold the package at the desk for you upon arrival). I have done this before with no problems; just be sure to use stealth packaging techniques similar to the top vendors on here. Of course, this method is only if you already have the goods that you are trying to send. Alternatively, you could just order them through SR and have the vendor ship to the destination address.

    What I did when I went to Malta was buy a tub of Tony &amp; Guy hair wax (as it is in a metal tub) emptied it out - put my baggy of coke on the bottom - refilled the tub and smoothed the surface of the wax to appear as if it is brand new.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After closing the lid tightly I gave the tub a thorough scrub and put it in my wash bag with other toiletry items in my main check-in luggage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    REMEMBER!!! The X-ray machines used in airports highlight organic material i.e. any material that is or once was living, so if anyone wants to smuggle weed they must put it in a metal container so there isn't a lump of organic material showing up on the xray (which would in most cases be investigated as smuggling any kind of plant material between some countries is not allowed)
