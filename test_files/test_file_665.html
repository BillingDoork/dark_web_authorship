    Your biggest concern is your vendor!  Only use a vendor that you have checked out their feedback both on their page &amp; in the forums regarding packaging.  Then when you are certain that it will be properly packaged, use your real name, "in care of" your roomies name, &amp; no problem.  As long as the name on the package works with the name for the mailbox, you are gold!  We have never had a package go astray when properly addressed with real name.

    Care of replies to a certain way to address something, if you're receiving at an address your name isn't attached you
    <br/>
    For example, if the person who does often receive mail is named HostName, you would write your address:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    YourName, C.O Hostname

    Your place sounds better than most, in fact - you won't ever have to sign for it, a large number of packages won't look suspicious, (especially since many may be going to the same street address), - the only thing you have to worry about is stealth. And I'd suggest keeping it domestic or from Canada, as I think a new splash of orders from all over the world COULD garner attention.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have heard of deliveries to apartments / gated communities working fine; I'd say your good to go.

    I was going to say also. So I can basically order what ever the fuck I want but until they actually get me to sign then they can never arrest? if this is true im set because I will never have to sign for anything. &amp; anytime I get something I should wait a few days before opening?

    I mean, I wouldn't go overboard. They might have reasonable cause for a search, and having drugs would remain illegal. Waiting a few days might help, write return to senderr on the box for a nice tough, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do get flagged, you'll have to lay low and can't use that address again.

    Edit and remove information from your posts, too. They're too specific and give away tons of information unique to your situation.

    If your ordering domestic and personal amounts go with tracking, there is minimal risk involved.. confirmation for both parties involved
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With small o/seas order I would not use tracking as this is more likely to be opened by customs, use a reputable vendor with good stealth
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With larger O/S orders you should definitely get tracking using fake names burnable addresses
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helps you really need to do your own research and make a choice

    Umm...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tracking, as in the service that allows you to TRACK your package as it moves through the mail system..
