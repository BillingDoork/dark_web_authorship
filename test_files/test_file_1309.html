    If it is from a reputable vendor then there is no more risk than US to US. I have made a couple successful orders the way you asked. Only top 5% vendors though.

    That is simply not true.  There is ALWAYS more risk when going through customs.  At least two people have received controlled deliveries from LuckyLuciano and another that I know of has received a knock and talk from law enforcement.  I have received kilograms of MDMA sent express domestic in the US on numerous occasions without ever having it vacuum sealed and the shipper never wore gloves.  I never had a problem, yet people have received controlled deliveries of 100 grams of MDMA vacuum sealed from LL sent from Canada.  There is ALWAYS more risk when it goes through customs.  The risk depends on the size, weight and packaging technique used.

    Inherently there is more risk. There is also inherently a risk that a a postal worker will drop a package in the US and it breaks open exposing the contents. But, we do not necessarily talk about that risk. The difference is a negligible amount. As long as you are not buying enough to feed an army, the vendor uses the highest stealth tactics, and you are just buying personal amounts it will basically be like ordering from US to US. Canada to US is much more trusted in shipping to each other than let's say netherlands to the US.

    The last sentence is very true.  No one I know ever has any problem shipping 10 to 20 pounds of cannabis across the US though.  I think you might have some problems shipping 10 to 20 pounds of cannabis from Canada to the US.  Also, lets not forget those small 100g controlled deliveries of MDMA.  I received amounts ten times larger domestically for years with no hiccups.  There is ALWAYS more risk when customs is involved.

    Yes, I agree with you Jack N Hoff. You just don't want to turn someone off of a vendor without giving a full description of why and what kind of shipment would be more risky than others. I figured personal use, since the OP is asking the question in the first place. You are definitely right though.

    Ah yes.  A personal use amount combined with a good shipping technique is nothing to lose sleep over.  There should be no problems with 10 grams or less even going through the worst customs port. :)

    Small amounts with appropriate stealth, I'd say the risk is low. This is something that you'll have to decide for yourself, how much risk you are willing to accept.

    Don't assume that getting shipments from Canada is safer than getting shipments from Europe.  Far more drugs enter the US from Canada than from Europe.  Also, the customs center the package goes through makes a big difference.
