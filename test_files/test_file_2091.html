    First of all thanks for reading my thread any and all help will be much appreciated!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that said here's the details. Ordered 1g of alprazolam powder. The vendor has a 100% possitive feedback so please dont jump straight to scammer until you read it all. Package arrived today and before I even opened it I noticed that right on the seam it had been cut with a razor (like the postal inspectors do when they open a package) and resealed with tape. I hessitantly opened the package to find just 4 pieces of paper!!! I just recently recieved a package from the NL and I feel that got me on a watch list or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really need to know if anyone knows what this means. Before this happened I read on the forums hear a thread started by a former postal service intern "Janetreno" he/she described to a tee this exact thing that happened to me as "postal inspector procedure" where they cut open the package on a seam so its not to noticable and remove/test the contents. I think its worth everyone checking out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that said here is my theory, Postal inspectors put me on a watch list after my Netherlands package. Days later see I'm getting another package and open it. They find a bag of white powder that is more than likely unidentifiable without lab work, so to not arouse suspission on my end they reseal the package with nothing but the paper left inside and deliver it to make me think I got ripped off instead of searched. Now that its been sent to a lab its probably going to be a matter of time before they figure out what it is.  This is where you guys come in!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What does everyone think about this? Any and all opinions, stories, articles, input, details are greatly appreciated, all I ask is that its constructive since this is causing me to go to "crisis mode" I'm freaking the fuck out. Does anyone think I could go to jail over 1g of Alprazolam? That's my main concern. What do you guys think could happen??

    Assuming you are from/in the USA.

    <br/>
    1)reseal the package.
    <br/>
    2) Get a marker and write "RETURN TO SENDER" real big across the face of it.

    Thats good advice but I freaked out and got rid of everything except for a lil weed (cus I'm freaking out and its decriminalized where I live) So essentially I am trying to figure out what would the punishment would be for a gram of Alprazolam (xanax) if the decide to charge. I bet they freaked the fuck out when they found a bag of white powder!! Probably went all "haz-mat" on it.  If I have any encounter with LE I have a good lawyer and will not speak to them with out him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would really like to hear if this has happened to anyone else and what happened. I am done with SR and will not be making any orders so I dont get in more trouble. Has anyone ever had this happen to them or a friend? Has anyone done research on this? Whats your opinion on this? Do you think they will charge me or let it go since its only a gram?

    Since you didn't receive a package with drugs in it then you haven't broken the law. Say, you have no idea who sent it to you and thought it was odd someone mailed you papers. You never gave it a second thought after that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There isn't much of a case for them to make, so you are cool. It was a worker who got your goods, and probably thought it was coke and is now trying to remember how to function properly.

    I think your bugging out too much.  They won't do anything imo. Maybe your address is flagged but that's about it.  People have ordered thousands of xanax bars and other benzos from India or the middle east and all they get is a love letter if caught.  Sometimes they'll even say bring your prescription to prove you can receive these. Of course no one in there right mind would go if they ordered thousands but maybe a hundred to couple hundred is pretty safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Relax and order from a domestic vendor bro.  It'll cost a pretty penny but you don't want to take another chance right after your package got snagged by customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shit I ordered real gun parts overseas, got caught and I got a love letter saying the customs is not going to release it and I'll be fined 5,000grand if I get caught doing it again :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fuck you customs! You stole my roids and glock parts ahhhhh

    Really appreciate these responses everyone!!! I want to let you guys know that I did order this from a domestic vendor, which is why I am freaking out since they can make a case against the person that sent it. I always hear about these "love letters" from customs (customs is only involved when entering a country) but the only time I ever heard about domestic seizures there were controlled deliveries, sometimes with small amounts they just deliver the empty package and do an investigation, which is what happened in my case.  Thats a good sign but I believe that IF its been siezed they have to identify it. Once they do I would like to know what could happen. I currently am acting like they are gona kick in my door so if they do all theyre gona find is a small bag of weed!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think its more likely that the postal workers took it since there was an ebay sticker on it maybe someone thought it was worth money or something. If someone did take it I hope they do a big line and OD.  But I need to protect myself, so for the time being I am going to assume that they are pursuing this. I got rid of everything to do with drugs except for the small bag of weed since its decriminalized where I live.  I really appreciate all of you helping me with these posts, most of it is easing my mind, but I still know its a possibility that LE could come after me. Almost shit my pants when I saw the cops drive by!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My million dollar question is has anyone ever had a domestic package get opened and the goods taken then re-sealed and delivered?

    So far from what I've read, addresses don't  get flagged. I've personally have gotten several different quantities of MDMA get intercepted from international vendors (from 1g-50g) and I have never even received the famous love letter (I wish I did the vendor didn't believe me unless I showed proof that it was intercepted  ::) )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't worry about it to be honest, if you're really paranoid then just don't send to that address anymore and clean the address of anything illegal. Remember, everything LE does costs money, money they have to use wisely and busting small time buyers isn't on their priority list right now.

    Sorry, im not all up on my "lams"; alprazolam? that Ambien?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, If it was seized, im sure they seized it as coke or MDMA. Being not either of these they proably just threw it out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or your some postal worker robbed you. Again probably thinking it was coke. Or something from ebay...and then coke.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if they tested it down to alprazolam what drug schedule is that under? III? I don't even know suffice it to say that 1gram of anything and you are ok. 1 gram of something that they probably  didn't even test for and I would say you are probably fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't take my word as gospel, but maybe rest a little easier.....

    Good Luck!

    How am I to believe you are not just LE trying to freak out the noobs?  I find this story suspect.  Why?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Given that LE has very few options to deal with SR directly, we must remember that low-level psy-op jabs at the user community via the message board is probably the most cost-effective method they have to 'staunch the bleeding' - ie. the herd of buyers flocking to SR (if you will excuse the mixed metaphors).  Generating paranoia, fear, and distrust will be their #1 tool.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We need to have a culture here that includes people not venting every freak out on the message boards.  If you can't think through simple situations like this one on your own without having a public melt down on the boards here, then you can't handle SR (yet).  Were talking about 1 gram of a sched. III substance that didn't even ship to your house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My personal stance is that we shouldn't feed these threads (in the way done so far), regardless of how tempting it may be to do so.  Send the user a private PM or something if you really feel called to assist.  Otherwise were just bumping up paranoia and fear to the top of the thread list.  If you are really willing to do the time for the crime, please think through all the contingencies of your situation first and how you plan to deal with them when and if they occur.

    Your points are noted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1g of a schedule III substance is exactly why it probably is NOT anybody other then who the OP purports to be. In my eyes anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can imagine the feelings that the OP was feeling when he posted, and responded in an attempt to quell the way im sure anyone here would feel if this scenario happened to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that said I can appreciate your points and would just like to remind everyone that this is a public forum, where you do not even need to be registered to read. All posts should be approached with the "The whole world is going to see this" mentality.

      My personal stance is that we shouldn't feed these threads (in the way done so far), regardless of how tempting it may be to do so.  Send the user a private PM or something if you really feel called to assist.  Otherwise were just bumping up paranoia and fear to the top of the thread list.  If you are really willing to do the time for the crime, please think through all the contingencies of your situation first and how you plan to deal with them when and if they occur.

     1g of a schedule III substance is exactly why it probably is NOT anybody other then who the OP purports to be. In my eyes anyway.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can imagine the feelings that the OP was feeling when he posted, and responded in an attempt to quell the way im sure anyone here would feel if this scenario happened to them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With that said I can appreciate your points and would just like to remind everyone that this is a public forum, where you do not even need to be registered to read. All posts should be approached with the "The whole world is going to see this" mentality.

    Great response, thank you for understanding and thank you for the info on how public this is. I also want to thank everyone who responded to this thread as all of your feedback has helped me out tremendously!! The issue has been resolved and if anyone is curious feel free to PM me and I will be happy to explain. Its actually a head scratcher. All of the events I stated as fact in my previous posts are all true, live account of what happened to me this week. Lastly I want to ask the forum if finalizing in these situations is the right thing to do or unneccisary. What would you do?

      How am I to believe you are not just LE trying to freak out the noobs?  I find this story suspect.  Why?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Given that LE has very few options to deal with SR directly, we must remember that low-level psy-op jabs at the user community via the message board is probably the most cost-effective method they have to 'staunch the bleeding' - ie. the herd of buyers flocking to SR (if you will excuse the mixed metaphors).  Generating paranoia, fear, and distrust will be their #1 tool.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We need to have a culture here that includes people not venting every freak out on the message boards.  If you can't think through simple situations like this one on your own without having a public melt down on the boards here, then you can't handle SR (yet).  Were talking about 1 gram of a sched. III substance that didn't even ship to your house.

    i agree, my first SR order was from one of the top vendors, and it never arrived. i freaked out for all the obvious reasons, in hind site i firmly believe it was a selective scam (that is another topic), but i came on the forum and asked for advice, a long time member told me to "sack up and order again" i did, placed 3 more orders, and bitched to the top rated vendor. The forums in part are to help the new buyers and if the OP feels compelled to reach out, so be it. i am thankful the SR community has some caring, compassionate, smart motherfuggers that are willing to help out. Hope it all works out
