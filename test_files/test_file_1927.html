    Hello everyone, I'm new to this whole SR marketplace so my question to everyone is basically what the title of this subject is...is it safe to send my packages that i order to my own home address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My other question is, is it okay to buy on SR with a MoneyPak card istead of using the bitcoins?

    1. Yes, its safe. Unless you're buying an insane amount of drugs or buying from a shitty vendor who isn't stealthy then you will most likely be fine.
    <br/>
    2. No, you gotta use Bitcoins, but some vendors on here will exchange moneypaks for bitcoins. Only buy from a reputable vendor though!

    OP by the sound of these two questions you asked I have to assume you know nearly nothing about silk road. You really should educate yourself before you take any action whatsoever. I mean that in the nicest way possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are tons of threads on these forums with clear information and instructions on how to keep yourself safe. Just check the other forums such as Shipping, Security, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The resources are available to you, just take the time to read them and you will be fine.
