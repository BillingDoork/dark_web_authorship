    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    most vendors require to write always the name of the country where the delivery is going. Thats a good idea, especially if you are not in the same country as the vendor. But wont the postal office find it suspicious if the see a domestic delivery, and the country name is written on it?
    <br/>
    If you put a domestic stamp on it, you already know thats is domestic. Right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, are the vendors clever enough, to delete the country name for domestic deliveries or should one remind them to do so?

    I don't think the post office will find it suspicious. Why is it suspicious at all?Â  I use the same notepad file w/ my address in it for domestic/intl orders and it has my country on it. I've sent packages to my grandma with USA written on it and they've never been searched/seized.

    You don't have to put it but it doesn't really matter in my opinion....

    My rule of thumb is "do what people in your area do" when sending legal mail. Here, that means no country on domestic mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When a (domestic) vendor posts mailing instructions that include country, I leave it out and explain in a short message why I am doing so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I can't imagine it getting so much as a raised eyebrow on its own. But it's just one more thing, so I avoid it.
