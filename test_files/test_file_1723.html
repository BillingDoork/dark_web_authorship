    I was wondering how other vendors do their shipping so the package can just be dropped off at the box and not have to be taken to the post office? What do I need and how can this be done? How do you know shipping prices to international? I can buy Express envelopes that is no trouble but I am wondering how to do packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Advice would be great.

    retail post outlets have pamphlets with all the min-max dimensions for their services. Ask for one at the counter. As for measuring, a shipping scale (1-1000g) can be bought online dirt cheap. Commercial CP customers can purchase a square plastic ruler with all the dimensions for the products from Canada domestic, USA and international. If you need any commercial supplies let me know.

    I use my Business Contract Account to ship with Canada Post (Electronic Shipping Tools). I've heard of others using "Ship-in-a-Click" with a prepaid credit card, which generates a printable label.

    National Direct, you are using your OWN business account to ship drugs?!? You mean you have an account with Canada Post where you can print postage onto the envelopes and you are using THOSE to ship? Although they blend in amazing, your insane for using an addess tied to you. Ship and click cannot be done anonymously....You can't just pay for express with a prepaid card and print it out here in Canada. Any express letters have to be bought at the P.O. and if you want to send a parcel express you need to walk into the post office and pay for the sticker. Start driving out to the boonies to find the post offices with no camera's and buy A LOT of express/other supplies at once so you don't have to make frequent trips. You are able to buy the express stickers that can go on parcels so you can just drop them in the bin, you are allowed to drop fairly large boxes in those binz.... In small towns there are still many post offices to be found with no camera's :)
