    Good day friends!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My package is stuck at the customs and has been for 1,5 months. No letter so far. The substance is classified as a health-endangering substance. So it's not fully as severe as it would be if it would be classified as a narcotic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered it to my friends place, but in my name and the friend as a C/O-adress. Yeah. I know. Not brilliant. But the package was supposed to be sent from a non-flagged country inside of EU. It was not however; it was sent from a fairly suspicious country in Asia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my question is how I'm going to handle it when my friend gets a call/letter. Obviously they want to know who the recipient is. Should my friend tell them that it is a friend that every now and then get packages to the address or should my friend just deny that s/he knows me? We were in the same class in high school. Neither me, nor my friend has public friend lists on Facebook.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you in advance!

    Is that sarcasm? I don't fully understand what you mean.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If he is forced to give me out I have been planning to say that I was giving out his address to all people who I met while traveling. Is that a good idea? Or is there any way he can skip giving me up? Obviously without sacrificing him.

    Don't try and come up with a story like that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone asks you and your friend have no idea what's going on. You never ordered any package, you have no idea what this is all about, you're completely innocent. Deny everything, don't try bullshit the police with a stupid story they could poke holes in.

    First of all, if the package was supposed to be sent from a non-flagged country and wasn't, I'd bring that up to the vendor...
    <br/>
    Second of all, keep your mouth shut! Both of you.

    Thank you, sounds good! But at the same time. It's fairly strange with a care of address with my name on it. So you don't think it will lead to further complications and suspicions when there are two names on the package? It really can't be enough for a warrant, can it? I would guess it takes more to get a warrant here than in the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I spoke to the vendor, and it supposedly not a more flagged country.

    Dude are you 12? he doesnt have to answer anything. You could have the same name as a million other people. So could John Smyth.

    However my fear here is if they call you or your friend one or both of yous will crack and any shit you land it will be your own fault.

    I've been arrested once to many times, I lost count and each time I tried something different to see what works for what situation and for them to just leave me alone. In this case just act lost and confused...Just play dumb and use " I don't know" You don't have to say anymore than that. Just "I don't know" shake your head a few times and if your a different nationality just tell em "no engrish, I don't know" raise your arms up and shake your head...No, seriously just play dumb and act lost like you have no idea and make sure you make eye contact..But, giving that it's been 1.5 months, already labeled, and wasn't a large amount chances are it's been labeled (Not worth our time) and tossed in the bin. Bad news, your friends address is burnt and flagged. That part I don't think you want to share with your friend , might get upset.. If they do try and press you guys by spitting words like "felony, long time jail" remember they don't have any evidence of you or your friend actually touching the package and claiming it. If the package do happen to arrive, take it as a loss and have it sent back...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck and remember.. "I don't know, SIR!"

    Thank you for all your replies. I understand the situation fully now. They have nothing on us, and if we don't fuck up, they will not get anything. So everything is cool!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It bothers me a lot that the address probably is burnt. I'm not totally sure about this though. The seller claims the stealth is good and it's not the most common drug there is. So I would guess that they have to send the liquid on a chemical analyze to figure out what it is. But then at the same time, why did it get stuck in customs in the first place?

    OK, so tracing it what exactly does it say? Just customs hold? Also do you know how she sent it in..I forgot to mention above that I work in logistics mainly air/ocean import export operations...and now that I'm a bit more clear headed...Depending on what she packed it in, if sent in a envelope 1. The infomation written on the label is incorrect or threes a fault, while it passed when shipped it could be that something doesn't comply here. In this case, customs sends something to the shippers post office and post ooffice contacts shipper..to confirm corrections so they can fix it. 2. It's important to know what she packaged it in and what she put as the commodity inside. Customs and TSA is really strict on paperwork and information that's on there..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway to not let this drag anymore than I have too..If you didn't get notified there's a high chance something wrong with the paperwork and shipper would be notified to send fixed paperwork. Giving thatt it's the road and fake but real shippers address was used..You can say it's a loss cause..If it were me I would just call them and give the post office the airway bill number and find out why it's on hold. lol Dumb? Maybe but iif they were going to do something they would of done it already...Sending things international is a pain in the ass..Keep a eye on it though, they could release it..I've had freight stuck on customs hold for 4.5 months one time because they had to wait for confirmation from some customs building before releasing it..It's safe t say you can relax now and if smoething does happen (low chance) just do what's said above.. lol

    I'm not clear if the op is in the EU, the US or somewhere else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.5 months is a long time although hell in the US some packages has sat in customs for over a month and then been delivered just fine.
