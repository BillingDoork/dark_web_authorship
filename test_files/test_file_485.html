    Had 3 from 3 packages searched by Customs this week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All different addresses, all have been used before with no issues
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Items sent from Eastern Europe,  South East Asia and North America
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All "padded envelopes" -  Small envelopes lined internally with bubble wrap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All 3 packages contained standard plastic foil seal used for tablets/capsules.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The locations have been used approximately 10 times each over 13 months with no prior Customs notifications and around 80% success rate, 20% non-arrival attributed to vendor action/inaction.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All packages were not illegal an as such delivered  with a customs pamphlet and green tape applied.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example below:

    So you're surprised your drugs from Eastern Europe, South East Asia and North America were detected? Then you've drawn the conclusion that customs has stepped up its game to another level? I don't really get it. How often do you receive drugs from the most dodgiest countries in the world? Is it on a regular basis?

    Firstly, please show me where I indicate or infer "surprise" in my post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly, in regards to your statement about "the most dodgiest countries in the world" Europe, North America, Asia are continents, not countries. This leaves South America, and Africa (save Antarctica which we can omit).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you serious when you say Europe, North America, Asia are "dodgier" than South America, and Africa?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyhow this post was for informational purposes only, enjoy.

    May I ask if they were all "normal" thickness letter type envelopes? (ie.~ 3/4 mm thickness) or larger ones?

    Avoid bubble wrap! It turns your letter into a package. And packages get more attention.

    North America is dodgy too? Even Eastern Europe is iffy (some countries maybe, but definitely not all of them).

    I think with all the media attention customs may have stepped up their game, I have had 5 seizes/no shows in the past 2 months, didnt take long to get to the country  but with tracking it just sits in "waiting for customs clearance"
    <br/>
    I have tried different names and addresses with no success.  Knowing what they keep on record would be helpful too.

    They will send you either a letter if they seized it saying what it was and why, or if they just open it and send it on it's way it will come with customs sticky tape and a slip or two inside saying it was opened and nothing was taken.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had a bunch of orders opened and one seized before, but they were all unrelated to SR and except for the knuckle duster "belt buckle" (wink wink) that didn't make it, everything else has.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have never lost a SR order but then mine are never more than a gram or two here and there and hardly international man of mystery level dealing!

    Just keep in mind that anyone that answers a question like that with anything solid is talking out their ass at least 99.9% of the time. You have to make your own judgments to what risk is acceptable to you but I think best practice is to ditch an address once there is a no show or 2 but there are many people who continue to send to their failed drop regardless of whats sitting in the customs office.

    pmsl. I regularly receive packages from O/S but none have been opened. Don't know why they would open all 3 packages unless they're starting a new policy. I wonder if this has anything to do with that idiot Ryan West focusing a spotlight on drug-mail. Thanks a lot dickhead, if you're Ryan and you're reading this.  &gt;:(

      Had 3 from 3 packages searched by Customs this week.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      All different addresses, all have been used before with no issues
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Items sent from Eastern Europe,  South East Asia and North America
      <br/>
      <br/>
      All "padded envelopes" -  Small envelopes lined internally with bubble wrap.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      All packages were not illegal an as such delivered  with a customs pamphlet and green tape applied.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Example below:

     So you're surprised your drugs from Eastern Europe, South East Asia and North America were detected? Then you've drawn the conclusion that customs has stepped up its game to another level? I don't really get it. How often do you receive drugs from the most dodgiest countries in the world? Is it on a regular basis?

    Noahg- if you think those are some of the 'most dodgiest countries in the world' you have problems bro and I would carefully close out The Silk Road and then shut off your computer.  Meditate for a while, then log back on to 'the road' and READ as much as you can and you will now be able to make informed comments on posted topics.  :)

    I've made 2 international orders; the first was from CrystalWife in Germany (one of the highest rated vendors) and I never recieved it; I assume it was taken by Customs. I should also think that it was sent as the standard cardboard letter or whatever

    Out of 100 orders, 95% successful. I've had only one which arrived that had been inspected by customs and green tape slapped on it stating as such. It was a hand written envelope with Modafinil inside, nothing was removed and I got my Modafinil.
    <br/>
    Aside from that, other non-arrivals have been scams and occasionally a vanisher assumed intercepted or stolen by the postie.
