    Anyone noticing recent delays with USPS? For one, mail used to be in the mailbox by 11:30am sharp, every day. For the past few weeks, it has come late--sometimes as late as 5:30 or 6pm. Also I am only getting 1 or 2 items in the mail each day, when I used to get several.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just waiting on a domestic order, supposedly shipped Monday. Not worried or anything, just really want my buds for the weekend.

    Yes.

    I outlined this in another post ... I think the closures are really starting to take effect.

    I am seeing alot less scanning, and alot of new scans on routes that I never used to see.

    If you are talking about a mailbox serviced by a USPS Mail Carrier there's a good chance the route that covers your location has been re-assigned to a new carrier.(or your regular mailman/woman has re-arranged their route) Shuffling routes among carriers is pretty common. On the days my mail hasn't been delivered by the usual 1 PM but rather it shows up late like 5 or 6PM..it's always because my regular mailman is off.

    YES! It's extremely frustrating. I used to know exactly how fast things would get to my little 'burg, but over the last few weeks it has been taking at least an extra day.

    USPS 1st class is more like low class now.  When I tracked three different legal items off eBay, the expected delivery dates were all  a week or even a day or two over!  It used to be like 4-5 days MAX from those parts of the country.  I also saw mail stop at different cities I never seen it stop before.  It's also taking longer to get sorted and processed at the stop points.

    Whatttt...is that even possible?

    <br/>
    Are you saying you're waiting still after a week and a half or it took that long?  Are you sure your package wasn't sent out real late?

    I had to make an announcement on my vendor page because I was getting so many complaints. Don't blame us vendors guys blame those lazy bastards at USPS! Right now they're about to default so they can't pay the government and the benefits are up in the air so the employees are pretty much saying "until I'm guaranteed my benefits I ain't working, mmmhmmm"

    As Delta said its because of the federal government screwing over a self funded part of government that actually works.

    On the brightside though, with even less funding, I'd imagine  the odds of domestic interception are at an all time low.

    I've had mail show at different times in the same week. USPS mailmen/women all have alternates in case of sickness or whatever. Don't get too freaked out about getting mail at different times. Also, they work at their own pace.

    I wonder if it makes a difference if you are in a US metro area vs in a rural zone. I would speculate that it would take longer the further from the city your mail has to be sent.

    In the past month alone i've had legal orders off Amazon take three weeks and a SR order take 3 days (not priority!) and vice versa. I really haven't noticed much of a change lately in my city., this is the same rate I got half a year ago on both sites. Every day at 11:30 on the dot. Guess i'm just in a lucky area?

    I placed an order that shipped Friday and should have arrived today but has yet to.  Ive seen all kinds of orders take longer or even arrive much sooner than they should have.  Funny thing is I switched to SR just because dealers around here like to play the "It'll be tomorrow" game.  I understand that USPS can be kinda wacky at times. I've seen lots of trouble when a sorting facility catches fire.
