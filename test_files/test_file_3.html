    SKIP TO THE ASTERISKS FOR THE IMPORTANT BIT!  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Years ago a friend/relative/acquaintance/lover of mine worked for a few summers as a USPS "casual carrier." Recently, over a few beers in the corner of a loud dive, I told him all about Silk Road. Not about my *activities* on Silk Road, but about the site in general (though he can probably put two and two together.) Now, this guy's never so much as smoked a joint in all the years I've known him (hence his getting a USPS job), but he's evolving into something of a libertarian and I knew he'd be fascinated by the sheer audacity of it all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously I was particularly interested in his take on shipping strategies. He said one thing in particular that I hadn't read on the forums (and didn't find during a cursory search just now.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now again, my friend was a carrier, not a sorter. But he worked for the USPS and what he said jives with what I've read about people's experiences here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *** The most pertinent thing he said concerns USPS's mail forwarding/change of address policies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are two kinds of mail: single-piece mail and bulk mail. Single-piece mail consists of bills, personal correspondence, Silk Road orders, etc. Bulk mail consists (mostly?) of junk mail: credit card offers, advertisements, etc. But not all bulk mail is unsolicited- most magazines, for instance, are shipped as bulk mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's the kicker: to my friend's understanding, when someone changes their address, the post office will NOT typically forward *bulk* mail to the new address. The post office will ONLY forward *single-piece* mail. I have no idea if this is USPS policy nationwide, but it's how they did things at his medium-sized post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So it doesn't matter if you're getting your mailbox stuffed with someone else's credit card offers and magazine subscriptions each and every day- unless you're also getting their cell phone bills, birthday cards and Silk Road orders, you have NO reason to assume that you're getting ALL their mail!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Disclaimer: if the previous tenant never bothered registering their new address with the post office in the first place, then yes, you're probably still getting all their mail- whether bulk or single-piece- and would therefore likely receive any SR packages addressed to that person. But what if a few months down the road they decide they'd better register with the post office after all? I know people who have done that. It's hard to be sure until something goes terribly fucking wrong. I say use your real name- or a fake one if you must- rather than drag other people into it.

    I've seen it mentioned. However, it's a good idea to let more people know about it.

    I just use my real name...all of my packages have arrived safely to my location and I'm not really worried about getting busted for personal amounts of drugs that I order. I just see a lot of people on here using all sorts of crazy names/shipping techniques and then get mad when their package doesn't arrive or the DCN shows "Undeliverable." Don't get me wrong, I want everyone to be safe and use good judgement...but be prepared to lose your packages or have problems if you're using things such as previous tenant's names (especially if they have their mail forwarded and they get your drugs).

    It's a coincidence you mentioned using your real name because a buddy of mine does that and we just don't see eye to eye.  His philosophy is that the mail carrier simply won't leave the package there because he knows that no one lives there by that name.  However, he also uses the residence where he lives.  I don't like to use where I live so I guess I'm more comfortable giving a fake name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would never use a previous tenants name just for the sake of any real names.  Very interesting topic!

    I really don't know what to think of this whole "using an alternate name" issue. I agree using a previous tenants name may be a bad idea; But I couldn't tell you how many times I've received mail at random addresses when I was out of town with my job, that I had no previous connection to, and never once had a package not show. I think this really only becomes an issue if you use an actual previous tenants name, that the mailman will know does not live there anymore. Who's to say you don't have a friend in town receiving an important piece of mail; a relative asking you to receive a package while he's away, etc.?

     Do you really think a postman will know every tenant of every house he delivers to? then when someone moves out and another moves in he has to remember that too? Posties in Aus aren't that smart im glad to say.
