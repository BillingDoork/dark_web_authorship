    Anyone in the US ordered from a Canadian vendor using xpresspost?Â  How does it arrive in the US? Express mail in the US, at least where I'm at, arrives with a different mail carrier than the regular mail . It;s delivered later than standard mail by a different guy. Does xpresspost from Canada enter this same system when it gets to the US? Will it come with the express carrier or the regular mail carrier?
    <br/>
    Thanks

    There is definitely more risk, it gets delivered by the express mail carrier and is treated as express mail once it enters USA, delivery time is 3-5 days although I've had it take up to 14.

    You WILL have to sign for an express letter coming from Canada. There is no way around this and it is one of the main reasons we do not ship to the US using express postage (but the main reason is actually for OUR own security, I am sure you all can figure out why Express envelopes leave much more of a "trail" then just regular mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once your express letter hits the US and passes customs, the USPS will treat it like any other domestic express letter....It will be delivered by the express guy and you WILL have to sign for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that helps :)

    Ya, it sucks when the vendor assures you no sig required just to find out it is. I walked right in and signed for mine, no problem . I've ordered fronm Canada B4 but not xpress and it comes no problem just like regular mail. So, the moral to this story , children, is......don't order xpress post from Canada. I've also ordered from overseas a few times and that stuff comes just fine. I got an order from Germany on Friday that I ordered the previous Sunday, 5 days from order to delivery . That was the 2nd order from that vendor and it was 5 days both times.

    What I ordered from Germany is small and fits in a regular sized envelope, it looks very legit because of that. I've never ordered bud from overseas, or anything else bulky.Â  I might be concerned about that, we have pretty damn good bud right here at home . The only reason I've ordered from overseas the few times I have is to get quality of product that is so high it's not easily available just anywhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck Cap'nKirk!

    Sounds like a damn good scam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seller lied, everyone who has ever sent xpress from Canada knows you sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seller could have sent it to a wrong address or fake one, and they didn't catch it until it got down to that office. Or perhaps he package intercepted that shit? Tracking will show that a abrupt return to sender.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is the seller telling you now? Your SOL or he plans to reship for free?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, seller used legit return? lol come on guys.

    I do a lot of Canada to US shipping, and I know that things are far different when your products are legal like mine, but here's a few things people may not know:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Purolator (All Services): Do not require a signature for CA - US. This option must be purchased.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canada Post Expedited Parcel: It's tracked, reasonably fast and no sig req'd (I think you can only do this online with a business account or at a Retail Post Office desk - No preapid version
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canada Post Tracked Packet USA: Tracked, no signature required, and I think you can pay in stamps or some other metered postage potion that only displays a generic postage rate.
