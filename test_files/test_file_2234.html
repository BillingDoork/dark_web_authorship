    Long story short, ordered a key of HPBCD from a legitimate chinese supplier a few days ago. They were good about it and their representative was nice. They immediately sent it out via express mail via DHL to my home address with a tracking number. Amazing service, loved dealing with them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I thought that was gonna be the worst part of the whole deal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I haven't been able to contact their representative (China time is like 15 hours ahead so it's like 3 AM there now) yet to see if they "insured" the package or put it up for "signature confirmation" but, knowing DHL and the stories I've heard, I'm skeptical. Why am I skeptical? Well they called me around 8AM today. I didn't answer because I was asleep but later on I txted them asking who it was and they said oh the dhl driver tried to deliver to u today but you weren't there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This got me skeptical. First. I'm not sure how they even have my number (although I think I remember giving it to the Chinese co. and they might have said they would put it on the order). But even so, like I said, this worries me. Not a lot, just a tad. It worries me because A. I don't really wanna fucking deal with this shit right now if it happens to be a setup, B. I actually am not sure about the legal status of HPBCD, I figured it was perfectly legal but I'm not exactly sure, C. They might think, just seeing the white powder, that it's like some cocaine or some shit and might think I'm some huge trafficker when I'm not and, like I said, REALLY don't wanna deal with that, and D. like I said, not sure if the supplier just put in signature confirmation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SO, for anyone who has dealt with DHL before, or anyone who has dealt with HPBCD, please inform me on their policies and the legal status of HPBCD. If this happens to be a setup, I don't even wanna sue them I just wanna get my shit and go so if it's legal I just wanna kno so then I can go down and get it with a legal basis for possessing it. Also don't really want my address "flagged" by them. Please u guys someone with real experience. I need all the advice I can get on this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully I'm just being paranoid...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    HPBCD is completely legal. You're being paranoid. The pack just required a sig, go sign for it and complex some goodies.

    Na dude like I'm not freakin or anything I was just a little concerned cuz some things stood out to me. Like they txted me at 9:15 saying a driver stopped by but when I stepped into the house the note they left on the door said they came at 10:50. So kinda weird. I know I'm good either way, just really don't wanna walk in and be cuffed and deal with alla that just cuz they THINK im some coke dealer.

    Just so you know, they'd test the powder way before they'd come arrest you or whatever you think is gonna happen. The delivery guy just doesn't see white powder, assume huge coke dealer and call the cops, things don't work like that.

    Try not to let the paranoia eat you up man, it can get anyone.

    That's what I assumed. It frequently surprises me tho how dumb some people can be. Whatever. Driver's on his way back now. I'll let u guys know how everything goes. If I don't hit you all back assume the FDA just felt like randomly making HPBCD a schedule 1 illicit substance this morning :)
