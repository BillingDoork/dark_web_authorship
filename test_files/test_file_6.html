    First, I’m a lawyer, but we are not all money hungry douchebags (but there are several).  Criminal defense is my forte, and I strongly dislike police officers - but the 90% morons make my job easy.  Next, this is not completely my idea, but rather, after extensive legal research - both statutory and case law - an improvement on another vendors methodology.  I freaked the fuck out out when the package arrived at my office.  Anyhow, I can almost guarantee perfection.  Finally, although this is anonymous, this is neither legal advice nor  an offer for representation.  Instead, it’s my humble opinion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Simple….  Use a return label listed as a law firm, but don’t get cute and use shit like, “Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe.”   The addressee is the client without alteration.  Finally, use a rubber stamp with either the phrases “work product” or “attorney-client privilege.”   The rationale is that if law enforcement believes the package contains contraband, yet they note the labeling, they know that any violation of privilege precludes evidentiary admission render the case moot.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This will work only within the U.S.  Of course, do whatever you were doing on the "inside."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    **** NOTE: - I will never use this “nickname” again, so any questions or criticisms will be in vain unless another lawyer disputes the validity. ;)  No arm-chair quarterbacks or paralegals, please.  You did not go to law school and do not practice law, so STFU until you do so.

    You may have gone to law school at STFU, but you don't sound like the smartest lawyer in your class.

    Just writing "nothing illegal inside" on the package will offer you the same protection, right?

    This is not a perfect method but it is not bad and would work for certain things.
    <br/>
    I am a vendor myself and may try it out for powders as i can easily make them look and feel like documents when packaged properly.
    <br/>
    It could possibly be a red flag for international orders because why would a law firm be working with some one overseas? kinda strange. For provincial it would be not bad but the chance of getting busted provincial is basicly 0% in the first place.

    Lol... I once got an order that came disguised as legal documents. I had already been having a bad day and my brother had just showed up at my place and could tell I was upset. I had also just picked up my mail, so when he saw legal documents in the pile he thought I was in some kind of trouble. He was so worried and asked so many questions I had to play up being upset so I could dodge off to my room to stash it. For a couple days I think he was pretty worried about me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors could take that kinda thing into consideration - well, this legal document idea is the only situation like this I can think of right now though, packaging-wise. But while it may have kept off LE, my brother's a pretty straightlaced guy and he really wanted to know what was up. I had no idea that's what the packaging would be so I almost panicked trying to think of an excuse. I wouldn't knock the vendor for it because it wasn't a huge security breach or anything, but I honestly didn't exactly appreciate it... or at least would have liked a heads up from the vendor that what I was getting might still raise some questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: Plus, it was a little unnecessary in my case... it was just a gram sent domestically...

    This doesnt work with any customs agency.

    <br/>
    They have the right to open whatever, whenever, however they want.

    <br/>
    Maybe domestically you could get some USPS agent to think twice ... maybe. lol.

    Putting stuff like this out there like its some kind of fact and representing yourself as a "lawyer" is ridiculous.
