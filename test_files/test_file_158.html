    a reputable vendor has claimed that my address got mixed up with a couple of others and that i should resend my address via PM and he will get it sorted...this is a day and a half after it's been marked in transit

    got a gut feeling that something is amiss and in the past my gut has been the difference between me and a lengthy jail sentence

    It is my avid opinion that there is no reason whatsoever for a vendor to request your shipping information AFTER the shipment is marked as in route......its too fishy for my blood....I would find a different vendor......

    It is rather sketch, but everyone, even your favorite vendors who dish out the gods candy, makes mistakes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You already gave the vendor your address, so I dont think it makes much sense that it would be LE. Just use pgp (just like you did the first time right?) and resend your encrypted address, along with a friendly note saying that you would appreciate some extra surprise for your troubles and paranoia.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    my 2 cents...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ps i beleave if a vendor is klicking intransit...he himself can no longer see your adress...thats sr security...long live sr....maybe a vendor can comment?

    You stand to gain nothing more than a single package of drugs -- probably a small one.  You stand to lose your freedom.

    The risk is too high.  Even if it's legit, I'd walk away.  What we all do every day is enough of a risk as it is.

    As a vendor this only happened to me once early on. I had to revamp my process to make sure it never happened again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In short mistakes and mix ups happen. You already sent him your address once. Right? What is the difference of sending it again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im SURE you are using PGP, so just encrypt it and send it. If not, ask the vendor to cancel the order, but do not complain when you still lose DPRs cut out of the deal.

    Just to point out, in America, if the vendor was caught (either for face-to-face dealing or SR sales, whatever), he can be forced to give up all information like passwords to his account, PIN, PGP passphrase, etc..  If he doesn't, he sits in jail.  Until he decides to give up the info.  Or dies first.

    It's ridiculous that the fifth amendment right to not incriminate yourself doesn't apply, but it's been decided that it doesn't by the courts.  Using PGP doesn't help if the guy's been replaced by a DEA stiff who has his private key &amp; passphrase (assuming he even used a passphrase and didn't leave it blank).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Granted, I think it's pretty unlikely... but I'm just saying that PGP doesn't guarantee you anything.  If it is a cop, then he's got the code to decrypt it just like the vendor did.

    Pretty simple: you're genuinely fucked.  Yeah, really.  If you can't convince the judge, then you get no trial, no jury, you're just in contempt of court and locked up until you're a corpse.

    Just send it again by pgp and don't be so paranoid. Shit happens and if you dump a vendor for a tiny screw up you are going to run out of vendors plus you won't get your letter.

    With all due respect SelfSovereignity I disagree with your statements. Legally, in the United States, this is still a particularly undefined situation. The police cannot force you to provide any information (IF YOU ARE AT THIS POINT YOU NEED TO HAVE A LAWYER THERE, DON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS WITHOUT A LAWYER) or just hold you indefinitely. That is not how it works. There have been a few small time cases but nothing that sets a significant legal precedent. I suspect a landmark case in the next 10 years or so as privacy and technological advances will need to reconcile eventually. But the legal situation in the US is at the point where you will see rulings going both ways.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The key is whether or not the LE agency involved has any other evidence. Not just the suspicion, but actual evidence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Especially, for the OP, if this is a small-time transaction from a vendor who has no other red flags then resend your address in an encrypted fashion and move on. It sounds like an honest mistake was made. I have no clue how if a vendor was busted he would end up having to ask you for an address via PM. It just makes zero sense in terms of LE strategy.

    I sincerely hope you're right, gracie, and I'm always open to being proven wrong.  As you say, we disagree, but I haven't done enough research into it to say more than "thank you for providing a counter position, and I hope you're right."  If you have direct examples or some such, obviously your information should be trusted over mine, as I only have vague memories I can't put my finger on anyway.

    In response to the OP:
    <br/>
    I'd just cancel and choose from another vendor. Could well be genuine but imho better to err on the side of paranoia/caution.

    It could have been as simple as the vendor going through the orders &amp; not having yours prepackaged, got all the rest done &amp; went &amp; confirmed all the orders &amp; then realized that he didn't finish yours &amp; if he didn't transfer your address already, he would have to message you to get it again.  Like Shroomie said, he probably will do things differently in the future!

    He also could have been interrupted &amp; when he went back, started back in the wrong place &amp; missed yours, or maybe he premarks them confirmed too early, or, or, or,  there are a lot of different ways to have messed up without trying too hard, but always encrypt, &amp; if you are too concerned use a different address.
