    I've made a couple of domestic purchases (australia) using my real name and address but I ordered a small amount of k (500mgs) from Austria recently and used a fake name and used an address down the road from me. Was this a bad idea? I keep reading about how you shouldnt use fake names as it can trigger bells at customs but I'm not sure if this applies to Aussie customs?

    Unlike some countries such as the U.S, Australia (Australia Post) has no knowledge of who lives at any particular address at any given time, nor do they need to know. I'm not absolutely sure, however, the U.S.P.S knows who is living at any address and could cross check information if requested. Why they need to know I'm not sure but it has been mentioned here numerous times previously. I use a few names at the one address and have successfully made over 50 international purchases without any problems (touch wood!). Just make sure the name you use (if that person had  previously lived at your current address) hasn't re-directed the mail to a different address. You can use an altered version of your real name too if you are worried, however all in all, using a fake name is not a problem at all in Oz. :) :)

    I think the real problem with your plan is that using a fake name via postal system is some form of fraud and you will get in way more trouble for this than 1/2 gram of K. (dont quote me on this one)

    This is true, however I believe that it would only be an issue if there was a controlled delivery or an arrest.. they could just tack 'Mail Fraud' onto the drugs charges... Of course, this only applies if a c.d or arrest goes down...

    I too used a fake name for my order, and after reading on a few threads that this was potentially a bad idea, I had the intention of cancelling before it was sent out and repurchasing with my real name. Unfortunately, I've just seen that my order is in transit. After shitting myself for about half an hour, this thread has brought me some relief. So thanks. Fingers crossed everything goes ok!
