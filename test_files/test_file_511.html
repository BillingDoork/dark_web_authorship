    I would seal it in a thin foil an put it under my tongue. I was on a EU-flight today and the controls were ridiculous. Or stick it with tape under your balls....... if you got some.

    Not a smart idea at all.  USA has the strictest customs at airports ever.  You'll be x rayed, particle swabbed, probably walk past several drug detection dogs, and if you even look at them funny you're getting pulled aside for a complete search of everything.  You would have better luck finding some there.  Not worth your freedom for 1 pill.

    How exactly were the controls ridiculous? Where they searching/inspecting checked-in luggage? Or just screening a lot of people?
    <br/>
    Where in the EU?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you only have 1 pill, i wouldnt have it under my tongue, just in case you are spoken to. Just have it in your luggage, checked would be better.
    <br/>
    Dont have any residues of narcotics on your clothing, thats a guaranteed bag search.

    As long as you aren't doing anything alse illegal, just throw it in with the rest of your legit pills.  Preferably put it in a checked bag.  You'll be fine.

    Used to do this kind of stuff when i was young, like taking some MDMA in my pocket on a flight or some weed in shampoo bottle,
    <br/>
    today i cannot find any reason why to take that kind of risk for 1 pill ?

    Of course they were screening the hand luggage. I've flown from Germany to Poland and back. The polish guy searched me much better than the German. The metal detector device made a sound. Make sure you have absolutely no metal parts in your clothes, so the metal detect device doesn't make a sound and they would possibly totally ignore you regarding a personal search.
    <br/>
    A few years ago I've already done that on a flight to France. I made three little balls out of my hash and sealed them carefully. Put them in my mouth every time I got in contact with customs. I mean.... C'mon it's an EU flight and not the ferry from Morocco to Spain.
    <br/>
    Of course you have to test speaking having your pill in your mouth before. In the worst case you can swallow the pill and have a very nice flight :)
    <br/>
    Good luck

    think if you vac sealed it a few times, wiped it down well with acetone or alcohol, and hid it amongst your checked luggage (maybe rolled up in one of your socks? underneath an extra pair of shoe soles? get creative!) you'd be 100% fine. if it can get through days of mail, it can get through a long day-trip.

    Yeah, I personally wouldn't fuck around with airport security. But if you're going to do it listen to what these guys are telling you and try to conceal it in an easy spot, I don't think you'd need to to tape it anywhere on your body. If its just one pill I'm sure you can find a spot in your luggage easily. You'd be better off putting it in your luggage than on your body IMO.

    If you try to hide something in plain sight, that is a Million times better ( and more deniable too) than deliberately going through an elaborate scheme to hide something that small that doesn't reek like weed.

    Drop it in your hand luggage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in my opinion airport security aren't as strict as people make out
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have smuggled 2cb to spain, and countless amounts of weed and shrooms from NL to UK just by putting it a jean pocket or just loose in my hand luggage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Airport security are more interested in finding bombs than drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One time when me and my friends where coming back from amsterdam each with a personal amount of weed, one of them got stopped at customs and was asked to open his bag. we all thought he had been busted. Turns out, he only had his bag checked because he had liquids inside; which can be used to make bombs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are overly paranoid, pull out the filter tip of a cigarette, cut it down a bit, slip the pill in, put the filter back inside covering the pill and put the cigarette back in the box. happy days

    If you just put it in a bag  99.99% likelyhood you will have no probs - people walk through with alot more than this.
    <br/>
    That said if your are worried as you evidently are then it probably isnt worth doing it however slim the risk.
    <br/>
    Leave the risky stuff to the daredevils and fly safe and have a peacefull trip without the worry of wether you will get captured.

    It's cold out this time of year, you're going to need a nice thick insulated jacket.

    An ecstasy pill is the size of an eraser on a pencil pretty much, one pill won't cause any problems if you put it in your jacket.

    A couple of years ago I travelled to Singapore and Hong Kong from the UK. Four flights in total. When I got home I put on my jacket which had been in the checked in baggage as it was freezing cold. Put my hands in the pockets and pulled out 2g of MDMA, stored in two plastic grip seal bags.
    <br/>
    I considered myself very lucky and annoyed that I took it all the way out there and didn't take any!

    Two summers ago when I was completely naive, I simply walked through the airport, went through inspection and onto the plane with two and a half e pills. The other half of the third one, I had snorted in the airport bathroom.  ???
