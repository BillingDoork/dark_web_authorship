    and i searched for this and never found a topic with a definitive answer. Is it more sudpicious to have mail that is incorrectly addressed.  what deniability is it when your name is changed a little. Seems stupid to me.

    Ive had packages shipped with a different first name before, I doubt the post office will do much for that, you could have a sibling or a cousin living with you as a roommate. In terms of plausible deniability, I doubt it could hurt, but then again I have not needed to use it yet.

    I do this to identify packages sent in the mail to me.  For example, if my name were John Smith I'd have packages sent to "Jon Smith", "J. Smith" and "Johnathan Smith".  It's not for plausible deniability, but just so I know which packs come from which vendors (since I may have several traveling through the postal service at one time, and because vendors won't ever put their identifying information on the package.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But then again, my mailman and I are pretty cool with one another - your results may vary, especially if you don't have a regular carrier delivering mail to you.

    Not to be a dick, but it's laid out pretty clearly in the buyers guide that you should use your legitimate information. Or, the legitimate information for wherever you're sending the package. Not sure if you're in the States, but there have been occurrences where USPS won't deliver a package if the name doesn't match the address. Or perhaps it's just the specific mailman - they get used to the names they see for the places they deliver... when they see something different, who knows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The beauty of the mail system here is plausible deniability... not much reason to not use the correct information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, as a vendor, I'd be pretty annoyed if a customer asked for a refund or reship because they put some bogus information on the package and it didn't get delivered. Most vendors use real addresses for the return address, but it's typically in no way connected to them... so it's not like we get returned packages back.

    It's funny you mention that, because I've provided my legitimate name before, and the vendor still purposefully misspelled it on their own. It doesn't matter so much as long as the package get's where it needs to go I guess.

    As a noob I'm reading everything I can.  When I go on SR, my account, on the right hand side are account links.  Buyers guide, receiving packages it says "Do not use your real name. This tactic doesn't work in some places because deliveries won't be made to names not registered with the address. If you think this is a problem, send yourself a test letter with the fake name and see if it arrives. "  Definately confused!

    lol. That is a bit confusing, I agree. As a noob that did read all of the forums, I chose to interpret it as " if you are too lazy to send yourself a test letter, THEN you should use your real info". Fake info with no test letter has a high likelihood of simply not arriving at all. Using your real info has nearly 100% chance of arriving....unless it gets intercepted....in which case your deniability isn't so good. Pick your poison.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My post office and mail lady don't seem to care what is on my packages at all. They'll seriously deliver anything as long as it has my address on it. For years I've been providing aliases for junk mail so I could recognize who was selling my info to third parties &amp; recognize what to toss  in the trash at a glance. Conditioning your mail system to get used to strange names and packages is really useful. I've read that somewhere on here and it's absolutely true. I did it without SR in mind, but it's to the point where someone could slap a label on a turd, drop it in a box and it'll make it to my mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, I don't send my SR purchases to my home or my name.lol. Fortunately, I've got other resources. Hopefully my first purchase arrives safe and sound. If i wasn't paranoid I'd have sent it to my house with 100% certainty it'd make it through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also don't want my vendors reading this and mailing me turds.

    "plausible"... is the key word. misspelling your name, with the right lawyer, can get you out of the charge(s).
    <br/>
    BUT.. at the same time, as someone said before, mail couriers do get used to just dropping mail off to the names they've seen for so long,
    <br/>
    and even the sorters could flag it for a second inspection because "the name does not match the address."
    <br/>
    if you are getting drugs mailed to you, use the most absolute correct address/name as possible. it might work now and it has in the past, but eventually you're going to get "fucked in your giraffe pussy" and you'll run here screaming "Scammer!".

    I think this depends wholly where you live... In any case I wouldn't do it. Do you still get the mail in your home address, even with the fake, misspelled name and all? If it comes to your address you might still be a suspect. It just boils down to the question if the LE has the guts to make you a suspect with the evidence they have, and in this case I think they will. IMHO you might be as well safe if you order it in your own name, clearly spelled in writing. As I said, I don't know what happens when drug deliveries are intercepted in your country, but the advice remains the same: if you get caught, just deny. Besides, with misspelled name there is just more of a chance of post office not delivering that particular mail to you. That's not a definite scenario, just a very possible one.
