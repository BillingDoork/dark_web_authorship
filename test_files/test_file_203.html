    I have a a stock of Cannabis seeds from my last grow, I would like to sell them and I am new to SR, I need advice on how to get started as a seller and also how to ship discretely because I have never shipped contraband before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am legit and I would like nothing more than to help people grow some quality pot and If something goes wrong I will promptly respond. I want to become a decent seller of my seeds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if anyone can give me some advice or point me in the right direction to get started selling my seedsÂ  and how to ship them I would really appreciate it too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also am going to sell them for really cheap, I was thinking 10 seeds for $20 USD.
