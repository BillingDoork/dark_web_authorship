    Just wanted to create this thread and post a link to the newbie section thread where it's being discussed how some SR users got love letters issued and contents confiscated in Denver via the USPIS.  Tread lightly my friends.

    The vendor in question (SativaSally) used a real address with a FAKE BUSINESS NAME that was NOT LOCATED at that address.  All the Postal Inspector had to do was look up that address and see that the business names did NOT match.  This is what I believe happened.   The vendor had great stealth on the inside of their packages (so I do not think these were picked out by drug dogs) but eventually using fictitious business names will catch up to you.
