    Was think of sending the boys on a interstate trip opening some po boxes for orders around 100grams.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wondering people opinions on how long to leave the packages before pickup?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i spent a few hours of researching but can't find a post related to this.

    I don't think it matters how long you leave it once the package has arrived. The common tactic seems to be to leave a note in the box to collect the package from the counter but doing that could be a red flag for some. Otherwise, I imagine, if they don't leave a note, they would rig the box so that the post office is notified as soon as it is opened, especially for 100 grams.

    Why bother opening post office boxes in the first place when there are plenty of other much safer ways of organizing drop arrangements. You need 100 points of ID for a PO box for starters and the general consensus of opinion is mail addressed to PO boxes comes in for some extra scrutiny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I were ordering 100gs at a time I would want ZERO link to be between me and the drop and that includes having used some dodgy fake ID to open a PO box only adding to the possible list of charges.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And please, no one go posting go to set up a safe drop here!!Â  if the OP doesn't already know it's not hard to find out.

    parcels get returned after 10 days i am pretty sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if its too big for the box, they keep the parcel in the back and leave a note in the po box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so the person collecting it later on would have to show id

    100 points of ID is no drama i can print my own.

    Box will be big enough to accept the parcel so if its not in there let it go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question/main concern is how long LE will wait at the PO box before they feel its a waste of resources?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it takes a month delivery will be left in there.

    You should find out how long packages can be left in the PO box for. If it is short, like 10 days, and 100 grams of powder was found I imagine they would stake it out the whole 10 days and then surveil you after pickup. If you are getting amounts that large sent to PO Boxes it just advertises you are dealing, especially if the PO Box is registered under a fake name or interstate address.

    Not true, you don't need 100points of ID. In fact you can do it without a drivers licence, check out the application form.
