    I was pondering how much safer it would be ordering bulk supplies from germany than from the netherlands. I have ordered from the nl before without problems but its a lot more timely then most of my orders. I haven't ordered from germany before. Im located in the states, thanks for any thoughts!

    I can't give any insights on the shipping part, but I can tell you the difference when arriving in the US by plane, perhaps there are some equalities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've traveled a few times from EU to the US, some of my flights departed from Germany, on some I had departure from Amsterdam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every time I arrived from a German airport, there was only the normal procedure of checking the passport and so on, but every time my flight departed from NL, the customs were already waiting with dogs for the passengers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't want to make any conclusions out of this, but these are my impressions I can share with you.

    Packages from the NL usually take longer than packages from lets say like UK, Germany, and Italy(including neighboring countries).  But that usually depends on the package size.  Obviously a product being shipped in a flat regular business envelope will be quick, but as the package gets bigger it gets more suspicious hence the customs may hold on to it longer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've gotten regular letter envelope packages from Germany in less then a week 2 times.
