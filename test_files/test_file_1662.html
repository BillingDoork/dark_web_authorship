    I recently made two orders that I tried to time so that they wouldn't arrive simultaneously.  Due to delays, it seems there is a chance that they arrive at the same time.  Any concerns I should have?

    Amazon sometimes sends two items out in two separate packages as they come from different warehouses. People get deliveries everyday of all sorts of things. It ain't no thang!

    I routinely place two orders at once. A larger 'main' order (the thing I actually want and obtained BTC to buy), and a smaller 'side' order (something cheap that I can spend the rest of my BTC on... hate having those BitCoins burning a hole in my pocket).
    <br/>
    Sometimes they arrive on the same day, sometimes not. Like Jack said, people get mail everyday. As long as the envelope\package appears ordinary and mundane, nobody will care about it but you. Truth.

    No worries... I've known customers to receive two priority mail packages and one express mail envelope on the same day. You have to remember there are rich people or retired people who have nothing better to do than order stuff off the internet because they can't go anywhere....Just make sure you use a real name and not different fake names for every order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shit I know people who receive several legit priority mail, an express mail, plus a load of first class packages, and a ton of mail on a regular basis...not  including FedEx and UPS packages Retired people have money to spend and nothing else better to do because they can't drive...

    Like everyone's said it's no worry at all.  It's rare for me but one time I had 3 packages arrive at once without issue.  I'd say the only odd thing might be if they were from the same vendor in the same packaging with the same labels and are basically clones of each other.  If these packages are from different vendors in different places there is zero to worry about.

    Doesn't it concern you that if one of the packages gets intercepted by customs the rest of your mail might get flagged? I'm not trying to worry you or anything but the whole plausible deniability thing kinda goes out the window when three more packages full of illegal substances in transit to your location get intercepted as well.

    HAha i was thinking the samething, thats why i never have international sent to my regular drop point. Because you never know when its gonna arrive, and if it get caught up and in the mean time youve ordered 3 other items domestic that are rolling in with a bevie of different drugs. That whole plausible deniability is out the window. I try not to order from overseas much, the are a few items however that because of price i just have to get from overseas but i dont let be a problem if it gets found and screw up all my domestic ordering as well.

    I had 6 packages in transit at the same time once and I had no problems!

    When he postman started delivering them it felt like x-mas. I was a kid again. :D
