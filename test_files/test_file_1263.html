    I'm interested in importing Methylone to Australia (25-50g). I've decided I'll order from USA or UK and not China. Which country would raise less flags?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's 4 vendors I'm talking to, all have good feedback. Would it be safer to go with the lesser known vendors or the well-known vendors?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also for shipping I was thinking of getting it sent to apartment buildings with unlocked mail boxes. Even going to the trouble of posing as a potential renter and calling the manager and asking which apartments are available.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also wanted an opinion on tracking numbers, yes or no?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have any other advice please share.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Australia, from what I've heard, is one of the hardest countries to import to. Also 25-50g is A LOT. Idk, I would advice against it. You might want to discuss getting it from a well respected domestic vendor.

    you may want to edit you post about planned shipping methods, and i wouldnt recommend posing as a renter either. perhaps pm trusted aus members on here and see if they can help you.

    You should remove this thread. You are in no way special, we have all put in the hours of research and you need to do the same. If you feel the need to ask questions that could so easily be answered misleadingly, you should consider a new hobby\career.
