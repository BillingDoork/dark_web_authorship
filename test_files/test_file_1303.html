    I have a buddy of mine who got something mailed to him in North America from Poland about 15 days ago and he still hasnt received it. I know when i got something mailed to me from poland to where  live it only took about 6 or 7 days..
    <br/>
    My friend is starting to worry as its been over 2 weeks and he only lives a few hundred miles away from me..
    <br/>
    it was only an envelope that was mailed( if that makes a difference..)
    <br/>
    If it still hasnt arrived is it considered lost?

    It depends on multiples factors(vendor location,transit date/real shipping date,shipping method,west/est us,the list goes on...)
    <br/>
    when ordering rc from salamalejkum(poland) it is usually  8 buisness days,sometimes 4 others 13 days
    <br/>
    So I would say no reasons to worry unless order is big

    yes it is from salamalejkum. it was mailed out on june 8th i believe. it wasnt an especially huge order, but it was a nice amount for me and my friends to party with :) The longest I've ever had was a delivery from germany that took 15 days, so I told my friend not too worry too much, and that itll prob be here anyday..
