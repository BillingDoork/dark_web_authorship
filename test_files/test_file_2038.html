    Heya guys, i recently got an offer to supply weed. I have absolutely none of the know how, materials shipping or containment. I would like to talk with someone about how to do this the wrong and right ways of doing it. I want to keep this out of the forums mainly because i don't want to expose shipping methods to the public namely LE, i would rather do this through SR pm, because i know people don't want to share their disguises in a public forum. I'm not going to be shipping ounces. First I'm going to start with 1/4s and 1/8s probably and go from there.

    I would suggest buying bud from either: weedman, budzilla, canamo (and asdf345 was good too i think)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There may be others, but these I've personally tried and they have excellent packaging.
