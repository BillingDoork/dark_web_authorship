    I have placed two orders in the last few months and none of them have arrived.

    Is there a possibility that my new address is already flagged from the residents before me? Or am i just paranoid

    It seems entirely possible. Were they domestic or international orders?

    usually the name is flagged not the address so if there is still the old tenants mail coming there write MOVED &amp; not at this address anymore they will remove any flags on the address but usually it is the tenants name that is flagged

    It sounds like you have not received any packages to this address or am I just reading to much into your post.  IF so I would double check the information for shipping that you are supplying as losing a delivery is possible.  2 highly unlikely....I have make many ebay purchases and after 3 years I was looking at a package I didn't receive to find out I had supplied an old address....not sure how it happened as I had never changed anything in my methods but I could not blame the sender. just a thought

    Hi Crazy Bart, i know what your waiting for and feel for you, that your package has still not arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I too, have had 2 packages and a reship not arrive and was thinking that my address was finally flagged as i have had no problems up until then.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One package and that reship was most probably a selective scam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And the other one was from N.L. and in escrow and he offered a reship or partial refund which i declined.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had no alternative addresses i could use, so i ordered from Dutch, using same address, but a different name and 15 days later there it was.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had 2 more international orders come through with no problems, so fuck knows how it works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The forums for me, are double edged sword, full of useful info. but way to many fuckwits with loose lips. Loose Lips Sink Ships.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every time my country is mention in the forums or on the vendor page that packages are arriving with ease, there then seems to be a lot of intercepts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    l once had a legit book, take 4 months from the USA to the country i reside in, gods knows why, the supplier and myself had both given up any hope of it arriving and had refunded my money which i then had to refund back. [hassle]
