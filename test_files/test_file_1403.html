    As per the title? One of my orders has been 'in transit' for 9 days now and still hasn't arrived.  Apparently sent 1st class and I would assume it was sent as a letter.  Starting to get anxious...

    I have had first class take 3 weeks if the seller skimps on postage, mail goes off to belfast and back with a charge added to release it. This is the only instance (for me) where first class is more than a couple days ymmv.

    Ive had one take around 10 days before, sometimes its just slow or stuff gets 'lost' in the system. Once one didnt turn up, waited 3 weeks thinking I had been scammed or worse it had been discovered - then I got a card from royal mail asking for 90p postage. Turns out the stamp had got kind of scraped off the letter somehow. These things do happen.

    Your vendor may have put it in transit when the package hasn't been sent, i have made 7 domestic orders every one has arrived next day. However post does go missing i have waited over a month for a letter to turn up before that was sent 1st class. Royal mail sucks and will probably get worse now it is being privatised.

    My first class post normally takes two days, sometimes gets here in one day if I'm lucky. It was day two for something today though, and it didn't turn up, so looks like it's taking up to three days now!!

    I've been waiting 10 days for my first order which was sent first class though royal mail. Starting to get a little anxious now and really hope the vendor isn't a selective scammer, since their feedback seems very good :-/

    no, nothing.  they've been in touch saying something along the lines of 'we expect it's been received now...' i replied saying nothing has come thru....

    reckon they've sent it recently so i'll wait and see what happens this week, if nothing comes i'll ask for a refund and take the hit to my stats and move on...

    Ah well, with any luck it's just royal mail being slow. Unfortunately for me this is my first order, so I've been pretty keen for it to arrive and every morning the postman has disappointed me!

    guess what!......it never turned up - feel like i was selectively scammed - the vendor mainly deals with herbs and i bought a small amount of mandy.  i guess he saw i was a new user and pocketed it and never bothered to send the mandy, looking at his feedback it seems i wasnt the only one to not receive anything. so i got 30% refund but seeing as the value of the btc has dropped so much since then it's basically peanuts....whaddacunt.  i now have a dirty looking 7% on my refund rate stats :(

    Still haven't received mine, starting to think I was selectively scammed too, since I received an order from another vendor first. unfortunately I FE'd, so not really the best :-/ but I did order from another vendor who didn't require me to FE and I got my product the very next day :-)

    UK 1st class should be 1-2 days, 2nd class 3-5. Don't forget just because the order reads 'in transit', doesn't always mean that this is the case. I've had to wait about a week for 'in transit' items before. Only done domestic and they've always turned up in the end.
