    Hi!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am a new vendor for Germany, and I would like to know about the german ''Deutsche Post''.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. In some countries there is no control in domestic postal traffic, no customs or checkpoints to go through, is this also the case in Germany?
    <br/>
    2. In germany there are ''Paketstationen'' and ''Postlagernd'', the latter being a german form for the international term ''Poste Restante''. Is it safe to ship to such locations? Some vendors require to FE if sent (some maybe even domestically?) to Paketstationen or PS, why? Do they check packages/letters sent to these destinations?
    <br/>
    3. In some countries shipping to Poste Restante is completely anonymous, you give the address to the vendor with the address of the Postal Facility with a fake/nickname, and just ask in the facility ''Hi is there Poste Restante for *insert-nick-here*?'' and you get it. Do you have to show I.D when receiving through Poste Restante in Germany?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I heard you need an I.D to establish your own ''Paketstation'', but whatabout the anonymity of the german Poste Restante, the ''Postlagernd''?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help is truly appreciated!
    <br/>

    Hello sax-man,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To my knowledge only letters can be sent "postlagernd" in Germany and you need an ID (Personalausweis) to pick those up.

    1_&gt;  There are no domestic extra controls.
    <br/>
    2: -&gt; It is safe to reeceive there. But some Vendors probably assume the risk is higher because there is one more fool  in the equation ( the customer).
    <br/>
    There are ways to get anonymous Packstations. Search thee Darknet.
    <br/>
    3-&gt;  Dunno about Poste Resistante in Germany but we think 99% you have to show ID. ( Fake ID?)

    So the buyer can just go to the local german post office and ask if he/she has any post waiting for her? and for this he validates his identity with a passport/I.D-card? You don't need to open up somesort of post box, you just can let people send you something in your name to a post office and the receiver can go ask for it in the office it was sent to with an ID?

    You do not need an ID to sign up for the Packstation online. They want to know your basic data like name and adress wich can be fake I guess. What you do need is a valid Email adress to wich they send the signup confirmation link. You receive a card that you have to use with your PIN to unlock the door.

    Personally, I don't like picking up packages from there,  they're  often in crowded places like train stations and Idk I always somehow feel watched.
