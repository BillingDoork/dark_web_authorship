    Hello thank you for taking the time to read this,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dispatch product all over the world and our packages are super stealthy , we have never had one intercepted. We posted to Finland about 12 days ago , all the status says is its submitted for custom clearance . I have emailed the postal company they say its best to contact royal mail , royal mail said its been handed over for delivered . its to a customer who i have not previously done business with . Even is they were to open it , it would like a genuine business reply letter . Any one have any advice ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kind regards

    Yea I have some advice for you:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't worry about it. Just wait for your buyer to finalise and if they don't, then you can start worrying. Sometimes its just a lazy buyer.

    Was that to street address, PO Box or Poste Restante?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems all PR shipments are taken to closer look by the customs. I have one shipment from July that still has status "Submitted to customs clearance".

    Hello my friend,
    <br/>
    Thank you for your advice , as soon as the package is posted I have no record of the address though i do have a proof of postage and tracking number maybe its on the receipt ? Even if it were open they would struggle to find the product, what should i do if it not there with in 17 days? but still has the same status?
    <br/>
