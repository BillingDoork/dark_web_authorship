    Ok, so I've been doing this SR thing for a couple of months now; I've received 3 packages successfully to my house with no problems at all. I know that shipping to your home is the best option, at least for the quantities of bud that I get; however, I am unable to do so because I've started a summer semester at college. I live too far away to drive back to pick up the package, so I decided that a PO Box would be right for me. I found a Post Office a few miles away from campus that had a box large enough for the package I will be receiving, reserved the box online, paid for it. The next day (yesterday) I drove over with my application and 2 forms of ID in hand, went inside and handed the guy at the desk my application. He was pretty cool, we had a friendly conversation while he went over my application, he even said that I only needed to give him 1 form of ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As he was entering the information into the database he noticed I had reserved the largest size box that they had and jokingly asked if I was running a local mafia. I laughed a little and told him I just wanted a box big enough to receive packages in, which he seemed to buy without any suspicion at all. Not realizing that I needed to say anything more, I continued to tell him that I had 3 roommates that I didn't know (I had thought of this in case they asked why a college student needed the largest PO Box USPS offered). He didn't say anything more about the issue; instead, he told me about their business hours and procedures (such as what to do when a package was too large for my box), gave me my receipt and box number, and told me to have a nice day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had planned on ordering to that box as soon as I got back from the post office, but my paranoid side was not satisfied with how things played out. The entire conversation was friendly, but I knew I screwed up. I shouldn't have said anything really because it wasn't a serious question, but I did a good job staying cool and delivered my response well. I plan on getting legitimate mail to my PO Box to cover up my packages from SR. The question is should I wait 2 weeks or so for my order or is it safe to go ahead and order now? Other factors that may help with this decision are as follows: I don't have the key yet he said he had to order more and for the time being if I need the box unlocked to ask him, I really want the package ASAP (its how I make my spending money for college), and I already have my bitcoins ready in my SR account (hopefully they won't fall too much in value). Sorry for the lengthy read, I just really wanted to describe the whole situation in as much detail as possible.

    worrying about that seems a bit overkill. not much happened
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What you can do is the following... have a buddy send over a semi professional looking package soon. open it without specific intention or thought right then and there. pull out whatever is in there very easy. Look if he is looking and show it to him. if he isn't looking ask him to please dispose of something...

    I think you'll be fine. You have the right idea in making sure there is other mail sent to the box. Even if you have to generate some of it yourself, it's worth it. Greeting cards and stamps are cheap, probably wouldn't hurt to send some to yourself, plus order inexpensive items from eBay or Amazon. I wouldn't stress out over your conversation with the employee, I bet their job is extremely boring and he was just trying to be friendly. I really doubt he was asking seriously about you being mafia.

    Right get some other regular looking mail coming into it, and some junk mail. I think it would look funny if the only thing it ever gets is a large priority mail box once a month for example.

    I think you did fine! It would have been much more of a screwup if you'd refused to answer his questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact that you're dealing means it's probably best to err on the side of cautious. If I were you I'd definitely make sure to receive a few normal (and ideally large - something to justify the size of the box!) parcels first, especially if you'll be ordering something bulky like weed. If you really want to put the clerk at ease, do as flashlight suggested: buy something that you can open at the parcel store. :)

    Indeed, better safe than sorry. I'm glad to hear that I'm overreacting, I'm going to try what flashlight5 said. Thanks again you guys, now I can run my mafia again without being so paranoid!

    Bro you did everything fine, Like you mention just have other mail sent their also, Order some Gamer mags or something. Or send your own self packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You gotta remember those guys are paid by the hour, they just wanna come to work, clock in and get paid, Most dont wanna go out of their way to cause someone problems, it just means more paper work an crap for them as well. Its one thing if your packaged arrived and had the place smelling like a Indoor grow room in the PO,LOL .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think its fine for you to go ahead and order also, Make sure to tell the vendor to TRIPLE SEAL THAT STUFF!! LOL, I got a OZ of DRAGON FRUIT a few weeks back, an OMG i have it wrapped back in 2 layers now and in a drawer across my room an can still smell it somewhat..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lookin forward to hearing your success story when your big box arrives!

    You should get a mason jar for your Dragon Fruit. It keeps the smell in, prevents the bud from drying, and protects those nugs. I can't wait to give yall my success story  :)
