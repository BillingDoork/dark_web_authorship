    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was wondering if some of you could share your experience with domestic shipping. Specifically what was your longest domestic shipping time for a product you ordered off SR...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm curious because I have a domestic order that is coming up on 1 week. Still has not arrived. It was a small quantity of yay. So it was more than likely shipped in an envelope of some sort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I be worried? Or is 8+ days shipping relatively common for domestic orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks! :)

    not in my experience. The longest I have waited is 3 days domestic but I am in the midwest. I suppose it's possible that if you and the seller live on opposite coasts and he shipped regular first class and the fact that the 4th was exactly a week ago (delaying mail) it is possible.

    Yeah I contacted my vendor. He said it could be because of the holidays but he also finds it odd that it's taking this long. I do not not if he is on the other coast though. I do know it was first class shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could they possibly be driving it to my location rather than flying it here? That would explain the long ass wait hah

    Does anyone else have experience in this kind of situation? I'm nervous to order any more items. I feel as though my address is flagged.

    Are you absolutely sure everything on your address was correct? I somehow picked up a touch of dyslexia on one order and reversed a single digit on my zip.  My vendor gave me the DCN and I watched it bounce between two cities for 9 days, each city had the package 5 times.  Eventually someone finally did some leg work and got the zip right and package was delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, stuff happens with the mail...all of it more likely than getting caught.  That is unless it wasn't shipped when you were told it was shipped or the packaging was really suspect. A small domestic package should almost never raise suspicion.

    Priority is guaranteed 3-5, express I think can go up to 9 days. Not sure about anything after that, although it could have been lost or RTS for messed up address or if the package was damaged

    Well I wouldn't know for sure if I type my address in incorrectly since the vendor deletes the info after he ships. I'm waiting on him to reply about a possible reshipment/refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think it would be a good idea to reship? or should I just refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm feeling pretty paranoid about ordering now. Should I take it easy for a bit?

    Not sure if your vendor has a DCN for your order? That could clear a lot of things up. It's the only way I new there was an issue with my zip code.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know its easy and probably safer to be paranoid, but small domestic shipments are hard to get caught with...unless it was a very suspicious package.  Are you sure your vendor sent it on the day you are counting from? Vendors will mark it in transit but not actually drop for another day or so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just to share a little anecdotal story with you - a couple of years ago a buddy who hooks me up with some of his pills sent me some via UPS overnight while I was away on a work project. At the time, neither of us thought much about the fact that what we were doing was illegal, but I get a package to my hotel and you could literally here the pills rattling around in the package.  He just tossed a pill bottle in an envelope and off it went! Since then, with minimal care, I've successfully received pills through the mail or UPS a number of times to cities all over the US. It is typically pretty safe....just not always predictable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope you get it worked out!
