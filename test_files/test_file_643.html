    So I got this e-mail a while ago now. Figured I'd post the reply here because it's relevant to everyone, and we're all nameless faceless people anyway.

    It's been a while since I got this and I waited until now so the events are asychronous.

     Hi there,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I noticed you mentioned this on the Silk Road forum:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "There are smart ways you could get someone else to pick up your mail and not let it be a problem.
     <br/>
     But, they're time and effort intensive, and not worth it for a typical buyer. Also they should never be
     <br/>
     openly discussed on this forum"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     and I was wondering if I could pay you some bitcoins for the answer to this question? I would like to know
     <br/>
     methods that don't make someone else take the fall for receiving packages, and I also would like to know
     <br/>
     methods that add to the plausible deniability and eliminate possible mail fraud charges. Your suggestions
     <br/>
     are much appreciated :-) I even thought of starting my own courier or virtual office company.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     p.s. I have 30k+ purchases on Silk Road
     <br/>

    I'm posting it here because it's the crux of why we're all here. We all want to buy and sell drugs and not have anyone else involved where they don't need to be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The ANSWER, that this person, and I guess the rest of you, is looking for is:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make SR what it is in your life. In mine it's online shopping for a recreational product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not hurting anyone with my drug use, and my drug use isn't hurting me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have 30K+ purchases on Silk Road, then indeed I should be writing to you asking you for help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are smart, which you are because you're reading this (ask someone with an IQ&lt;100 to get onto the SR forums, no further direction... They won't get there), and you use SR in a responsible manner then everyone should be happy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is no magic answer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want me specifically to get more involved in your affairs and help you as a consultant, fine. My intial engagement fee is $1,000,000 and I will need it in cash before our discussion goes any further. You can contact me via PM or firehawk@tormail.org ; but please do keep in mind the fees above will be incurred in any e-mail or other correspondence asking me for further clarification.
