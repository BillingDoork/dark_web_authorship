    I am mainly looking for methods to transfer the loot back and forth for larger shipments (up to 10k in cash). I know most of you will tell me this is stupid, but I also do know there are vendors out there that have done this in the past. Am willing to share techniques in getting product to client safely and anonymously regardless of 13 oz. rule. Please post here or PM me if you feel more comfortable that way.

    Best,

    You split the shipments into smaller parts as to minimize all risks :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lower risk of seizure: A big package will attract more attention than a small package
    <br/>
    Lower risk of losing money: If you split your shipment into 10 pieces, and they only seize 1 piece, you will still have 90% of your drugs, and not lose 100% at once.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it's logical.

    Interesting. Thoughts on receiving a few priority mail envelops vs. 2-3 regular mailing envelops per day? Which is more unsusual?

    Try and combine them, priority and regular.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if you're receiving that much mail a day, why don't you subscribe to all the online magazines you can find and have them send you brochures and whatnot.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That way you'll get like a shitload of mail every day, and 80% of it will be non-drugs ^_^.
