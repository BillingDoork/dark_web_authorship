    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I just recently placed an order for a little bud, and I was really wanting to try out Puzzle's MDMA (looks delicious; any opinions?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With holiday shopping coming up (if it hasn't started already,) I wanted to try and receive everything before December, but I'm a little worried about having two packages en route at the same time.  I do realize the only person that may notice is the mail lady.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think it'd look suspicious or anything out of the ordinary if she dropped off two SR packages on the same day, if they were to come on the same day? Do you think she'd care?  Do you think I should wait until next week to order the MDMA?  As you can see, I have a few questions I've been mulling over and I'd really like some input.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks a lot for any suggestions!
    <br/>
    <br/>
