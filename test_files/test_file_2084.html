    Hey, new to SR and just wanted to ask a question, my situation is a little bit different from anything else i have read in the forums as i am a university student who is living with a flat mate next year, he Doesn't move in until October but i move in a lot earlier than that anyways... We have just started the tenancy and i was wondering if i could take advantage of that by putting on the delivery address the names of the previous tenants or putting simply the 'tenants of...' *my address* Any thoughts on doing that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, i dont move in for a little while yet as i am not living there yet but with my situation i can go to the flat whenever i like so this makes it safer for me so i was wondering if i could just put my real name on the delivery address and hope it arrives and keep checking the mail box.
    <br/>
    Any thoughts and suggestions are welcome.
    <br/>
    Thanks please don't hate on me if I'm being an idiot I'm new :)

    To be perfectly honest I don't think it makes all that much difference what name you put on the package for the following reasons:
    <br/>
    a) If it gets intercepted, and they do a controlled deliv - it's still you who's holding the package
    <br/>
    b) If you're careful about how you buy your coins, and how you access the tor network (i.e. using the latest updates etc), it's really plausibly deniable that it was you who ordered the package. As long as you don't crack under pressure, how would they possibly prove it was you who ordered it? I would open mail addressed to me, and if I felt suspicious about it, i would chuck it in the rubbish/even report that someone had been sending drugs to my address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't stress too much. I'm sure plenty of people use other people's addresses as 'drop points' - and I'm sure the people who live there are afforded some kind of legal protection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck and happy buying!

    I disagree.  If you can successfully receive your pkgs without having to incriminate yourself by using your real name...DO IT!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should test out any names of previews tenants  by sending yourself some 1st Class mail in that name. Even though you will get mail addressed to previews tenants you won''t know if they filed a "change of address. Change of address does not cover all classes of mail..like periodicals, junk mail, mass mail.  Send yourself a Priority mail, with DCN.  If it gets delivered back to your residence then ur safe to use that name.

    Ok cool thanks for the replies, Just one more thing, I am in the UK and was wondering if my order size (10 mdma pills) would be enough for them to justify a controlled delivery?? Its not like i live there at the moment anyway so nobody will be home to answer the door... In fact I'm in a foreign country so if the packet is there then awesome and if not then well i guess i move on really. What will happen if the package is not there? Will they come knocking for me?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also,really just need somebody with experience to explain to me what the risk is to me as nobody lives there at the moment (although i am registered there and what not)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance Tuxman
