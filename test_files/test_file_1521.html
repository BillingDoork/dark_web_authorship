    I recently ordered two separate substances from the same person international. I asked in my message to try to couple it as much as possible, in reality it was 4 orders, but two where the same, just double. I received one of the substances, combined the two orders, but not the other. I figured this would be a safety measure, and figured i'd receive the other the next day. This sadly was not the case. I'm just curious if both were marked in transit the same time, and i've only received one, the other package being bigger than the first, should i be worried yet? Yes it's only been one day separate, but is there a time i should be concerned? Is this a normal practice?

    Thanks much for your input.

    If they were drastically different sizes, it's not unlikely they ended up on different boats, planes, trucks, or whatnot at some point.Â  Give it a few days.

    The number one reason I stopped importing drugs is because they dont, no matter what country your dealing with, understand the importance of getting that shit in non-conspicuously. I dont care how many cool moisture barrier bags you use, getting a funky foreign package from the same place every week can do a lot worse damage.
