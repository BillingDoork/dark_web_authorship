    Brand new SR user, long time smoker. This is perhaps one of the most beautiful places I've ever come across on the internet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been lurking all day, as before I go ahead and place an order I want to saturate myself with as much information as I can. However, I have one question I haven't seen answered so far.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would it make any difference in safety if my post office was located in a highly urban area with lots of incoming mail, rather than a low-traffic, rural post office? Is there a smaller likelihood of random inspection if an urban location runs through 10 times as much mail in one day, or does it do the opposite? Could it be more dangerous to go through an urban post office? Or does it make no difference?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S First post, if this is a retarded question let me know.

    The post office just sorts and delivers mail, customs does all the inspecting stuff.

    That is not true. The post office is also trained to look for suspicious parcels. Yes that is the focus at customs and most postal worker employees don't care but you can't say they are not expected to keep an eye out. (Do you think local USPS packages in the states don't get pulled?) I had one flagged because I was ordering a legal but hazardous chemical and they do not allow that to be mailed. Second order went through but they do look out for suspicious parcels.

    As for the question, small or large post office is unique to the location. Maybe the small town one is more apathetic or maybe they are more gun-ho and care about their job. Same with one with heavy traffic. Depends on how it is run. You can go chat up an employee at one a location and get a feel for how they perceive their job.
