    Hello Everyone, I think once everyones back to order I may take the plunge in being a vendor...  I have seen a thread before about labelling/labellers and vacuum sealing.. and heard there are ones that can be traced back or something along those lines? I am looking for info on which ones are good to buy and cannot be traced back and a possible place to pick them up online annoynomously? Thanks

    Vacuum sealers are not traceable as far as I know. They're mainly used for storing food and are not suspicious at all. You can pick one up anywhere online without any worries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some bigger issues are leaving fingerprints, inconspicuous labeling, drop off locations, etc. I suggest you do more research in these areas as well.
