    In the US, first class takes 3-5 days. Tomorrow is day six. Wish me luck.

    First class shipping via USPS seems to have gotten extremely slow. It is not 3-5 days anymore. This is really annoying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fortunately USPS Priority is still 2-3 days.

    I feel your pain brotha. How long does 1st class take for usually? It's been a week and I still don't have my shit.Never again am I ordering anything via first class, especially without a DCN. How am I supposed to know if it was seized, delivered to the wrong address, or just taking a tour of the country? Fuck that. Priority never took longer than three days to get here, and it gets here in two almost half the time, even from 3,000 miles away.
