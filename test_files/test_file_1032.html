    I ordered a package from a well-reputed vendor on SR. It was marked as shipped a month and a half ago. About two weeks ago it was still marked as "Origin post preparing shipment". Earlier last week, the package was said to be in a state halfway across the country. I thought, "Oh, it'll be here this week." But that was not the case. The package was then marked as "Origin post preparing shipment" AGAIN and the date that it was supposedly halfway across the country was moved back to a week after it was sent out. What's going on? Is there any chance I will get the package?

    A month and a half ago this was marked 'in transit' ?!?! Never had to wait that long on any package and would be a little questionable about that. Especially if it's domestic, shouldn't take anywhere near that long.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On a more positive note, I've had something similar to this happen. Package was marked in town on the tracking, then it randomly shot ALL the way across the country. I was like wtf? Freaked for a good bit. Took a while to get back but finally made it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope for the best.

    I've had a package come into the customs in the US, leave customs, return to customs, leave customs again, then arrive at it's destination accompanied by DEA.  The tracking said everything except for the DEA part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was a massive package.  I wont answer any questions or go into anymore detail about that situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had four express packages go missing for almost two months before receiving four seizure notices.  My supplier informed me that it happened to a lot of his express shipments that week.

    it is a pretty big package. i do not know if it is "massive" by your standards, but it is decent size. it is international, and also had no word on customs. it just.. came into the country from another country, then hiked its ass back to the original country. i am just hoping i have nothing to worry about. should i clean my place?

    You located in the US?  When I said massive I meant containing more than a kilogram.  I'm assuming the return address was fake.  I wonder where it'll end up.  Cleaning never hurt anyone.  Better safe than sorry.  Good luck.

    You can say I'm around there. I'm well under a kg. Cleaning sounds like a good idea. Do you think there's any chance that it'll end up here? If there's any chance I've got to be wary of it...

    I don't see it getting delivered to you.  Not if it's already touched down in the US then went back to the country of origin.  I'd guess it's either being examined and sent to the fake return address.  Why can't I ever receive unexpected drug shipments in my mailbox?  Yeah might as well clean up and play dumb.  It was never in you possession so unless they have proof of you being connected to it then you're good :)
