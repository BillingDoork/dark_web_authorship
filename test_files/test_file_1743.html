    I recently purchased 3 things from 2 different vendors, both from the NL and none have arrived yet. It is day 11 and 12 for both of them, and from past experience, i know they always arrive 3 days after transit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am within Europe and i have received their stuff before using the same listings.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I received stuff from other countries this week (also 3 days in transit) flawlessly, but not from the Netherlands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it possible that something has gone down in Holland? Anyone else experiencing the same thing?

    There's always been problems reported all over the forum of not receiving packages from Holland.Â  I haven't heard of anything in particular recently but it seems to be almost expected that packages sometimes don't arrive.

    First depends what country you're from...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am Dutch but I don't ship from NL because of the bad result in general with TNT and -very important- that bad reputation we have because of our free drugs policy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I send orders from NL to Belgium and England they always arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other countries Germany, France etc. not from Holland but always from Belgium.
    <br/>
    Scandinavia of course from Belgium.
    <br/>
    From NL/scandinavia 80%+ chance of seizure
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything coming from Holland will raise attention.
    <br/>
    I think when sending to USA etc. from NL 50+% will not make it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ship all over the world from Belgium with a 99% success rate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're smart, don't order from NL...sorry guys.
    <br/>
    Dutch vendors should take a reshipper from Belgium or UK.
    <br/>
    Or drive to the border (as I do 4 x a week)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have fun and stay safe
