    Ever noticed how every single thread in this subforum is either paranoid, anxious, ominous, etc? Jeez people. Head on over the main site and order a couple Xanax or something. It's like all the meth users congregate here! LOL. Just kidding..

    It's only paranoia if one THINKS people are out to get them. Given that LE would doubtlessly love to lock away each of us for being a part of Silk Road (or, at least, extort some sweet, sweet fines/court fees/probation fees out of us), I think the people in this particular sub-forum, though clearly nervous, are showing due diligence. One can never be too cautious about preserving one's freedom. That said, many here could stand a little patience; wait and see before completely loosing their shit, tying a rope to the rafters, and hanging themselves because they assume LE intercepted their package, and are on their way.to make an arrest when the package is a day late

    You'd think that nobody ever gets any post at all.
