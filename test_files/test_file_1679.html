    What's up guys. When you give your address do you go all caps or just cap the first letter? It probably doesn't matter much regardless, but I've been switching between both. I work for a large shipping company and deal with lots of letters. It's easier when people use all caps, and it seems like that's what most companies do.

    I see a lot of vendors saying to use this format so I'm curious.

    I've heard using the extended zip code was better and could get it there faster, it's what I use at least

    If your order is coming from a personal address to a personal address (like an average letter being sent from a person to a person, not business to business) you should go with what looks normal for person to person letters. If business to business address, use all caps. I doubt it's the biggest concern to the USPS how you use your caps as long as it gets there, but hey, never hurts to be safe.

    I agree with you mate! I base it on the vendors packaging style and usually alternate.

    Yeah that makes sense. I'm pretty sure 90% of what I've gotten had the return address of a company. Actually it might be every order, I can't remember a vendor just using a person's name and addy for the return address.

    All caps is like yelling the customer's name and address. I try to avoid it even on business mailings. I prefer to blend rather than stand out.
    <br/>
    On return addresses of businesses, all caps for a short business name looks good. If you look at/use a Logo graphic, it will show you how they like to publish their name. I am not sure all caps even looks good for longer names. Look at websites or Junk mail to get a feel for business methods. I'm not sure what they do, I do what fits my theory as to what I think seems pro, but, stands out as little as possible.
    <br/>
    The USPS does have guidelines as to what's best. I hear they give both/inconsistent answers though.

    Good to know.
    <br/>
    I'll be sticking with my less USPS-preferred approach and I even hope the OCR has a little trouble with my return address size and fonts now and then ;-) The address it is going to should be very readable. If you use an inkjet printer to avoid the secret yellow dots most newer lazers add to all printouts, I suggest clear tape over the important address to avoid raindrops or coffee or... obscuring the non-waterproof ink.

    All caps here, and I put "MR." in front of it too. Not quite cheeky enough to put "ESQ." at the end though.
