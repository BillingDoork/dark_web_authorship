    Waiting on a small bud order US to UK. Vendor seemed fine at the start and has good ratings but he later said he said he'd shipped it twice before admitting he hadn't. Anyway he eventually says he shipped it first class but it's been a week now and I've seen nothing, apart from a police car outside my house this morning. Advice?

    Only advice I have for you is to chill out and not to worry. It sounds, to me, like the vendor dicked you around. He has a different story each time, so he is obviously bullshitting! Maybe clean your house of drugs and paraphernalia for the time being. Other than that, i'd say you're fine. If anything does happen, keep your mouth shut ;)

    Yeah you're right, I'll chill out, clean my house out and just hope for the best. I'm sure it'll be alright.

    If it's a small order, it's unlikely that you'll have any issues.  If it gets discovered, it will probably just be seized.  That being said, it also sounds like the vendor is dicking you around a little, so it's also always possible that the vendor either didn't ship it out, or somehow messed it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would encourage you to take it to resolution when the option becomes available to you.

    Thanks Cirrus, I won the bud on a lottery listing, so it's highly likely the vendor will spout out a load of bullshit about it not getting delivered.
