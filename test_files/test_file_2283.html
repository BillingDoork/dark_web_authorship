    yes i had a item arrive in local customs on sunday. As usual it says arrived at sorting facility. Now i understand was a sunday and i waited until today to check and still the same!!! it has not said inbound into customs... departed customs........... ANYTHING! It got me worried! i mean its nothing that smells. but that does not mean well i am trying to hope for the best! I know usps update tracking fairly faster than the foreign ones do.
    <br/>
    So, any one with some advice? i mean the house is spotless clean! now worries there! i mean it just never even said as it always does when coming from abroad that its inbound and then outbound of customs, Just it arrived sunday and Early in the morning, so that 3 to 4 days. and nothing? this is my 3rd order and i mean spaced out from his vendor. to different addresses...so on, but it always says with in a day maybe 2 because sunday that its inbound into customs.
    <br/>
    So. Anyone experienced this? I have only checked tracking twice, sunday and then today I do not want to over do it. but please anyone with similar experience or advice i would greatly appreciate it!!!
    <br/>
    thank you in advance! we must stick together to keep informd and help eachother out!
    <br/>
    Als, i mean It may have went today and not updated? Does it update at a certain time? I am just nervous. Clean hose and that is all well and good. Just Concerned 4days in customs and has not move? and last 2 times it moved that day or the next?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i hope to hear back from any and all!
    <br/>
    and thank you in advance!!!!!!!!!!

    thank you., but i am on the other side well more mid east of the us. So i mean its def not SF customs, but have you seen i sit for 4days and not even say its inbound? i mean come on this is a decent size order and of course i am nervous! Also, the tracking has been fucked from the door. well their local tracking it was scanned in the sorting 3 times in 1 day before it left,. ha i mean some 20 min. apart. Then it said it departed 20min before it was registered with their customs. So its been all ass beckwards! i appreciate having some one to talk to and sharte similar situations.
    <br/>
    I mean when you had it sit for 6 days, did it say inbound and then sit 6 days? because mine just says arrived at sorting facility "customs:ICS o what ever t is sunday. i mean i would just like some feedback on what happened a little more from you end if you do not mind
    <br/>
    or anyone else too feel free to share!
    <br/>
    I am nervous, clean house and all that but still you want to know if the goodies are coming, IF they have left customs or have went in bound to be checked! or outbound i mean its just been there 4days and just says arrived?ha
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thank you fred and anyone else who can tho  some input in
    <br/>
    thank in advance

    1. Maybe seller didnt really send Express.
    <br/>
    2. NY customs doesnt often scan inbound or outbound .. so there is that too.
    <br/>
    3. USPS sucks
    <br/>
    4. Customs sucks
    <br/>
    5. Your fine lol

    i've seen it  say it was still at the po in canada and the mailman is at my door delivering it.  So the only time it got scanned was at the po in Canada and when it was delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USP tracking notoriously SUCKS!

    I wouldnt worry at all if I were you

    fred and intda..
    <br/>
    its not ny but anyways the one it is ALWAAYS SAYS WELl always i mean the last 3 times it says processed through sort facility,,, and then i had it that day say inbound to customs and time and outbound to customs,   Last pack was same thing it was processed through sort and next day inbound and 2 hours later outbound and 2 hours later arived a sort facility that it goes to in chicago before comes here. So it def uses the inbound and outbound.
    <br/>
    I dont know it just helps explaining it a bit and talking, I mean come on i got a grey hair ever order!lol
    <br/>
    no for real thought, I do not think was express just prority or whatever.   I dont know. I mean shit i know i have seen it skip the arriving at the place after in chicago and be at local office, but never seen it not go to customs inbound and out bound. i mean it was sent the 4th. so we are talking over 2 weeks! this is a record all ttime fucking slow! but from your experience. I mean is this bad its not inbound? that mean they you know? or would it go ibound and not come out? Shit i hope your great SR users and forums guys got some more good advice now you know more of the cirmumstances surrounding the situation:)
    <br/>
    let me know and know itt is appreciated!
    <br/>
    thank everyone!

    AV,
    <br/>
    I can confirm that EVERYTHING FRED SAID WAS FUCKING RIGHT YABADABDOOOOOOO.
    <br/>
    THAT tracking said arrived at customs sunday and did not say shit and it shows up yesterday, I did the return to sender...... I mean but off the gate it was the regular mail person. but still. Just wanted to let you guys know that it came and DAmn fred if i could give you points!i would! because that shit was on like 100%,
    <br/>
    Now, i  have had tracking say  arrived and then arrive at next place with out saying departed, or you know skip a step but that fucker go to customs must have left on monday or tues latest, Damn its good to have it work out. :) i for real dont have to take a zanny bar tonight to sleep, lol i can take one to relax,ha
    <br/>
    ONE QUESTION FRED OR ANYONE, is it true if you order international and you get it registered letter say from india you dont have to sign but still have tracking? I know i can say i had it work once from asian country, but is this any registered letter? and by registered letter it was still a small parcel?
    <br/>
    let me know thank you but i just wanted to follow up and say hell ya it came!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and  Avurelius Venport,  about 5 months ago before i really go into SR i had a hook up international, HE SWORE UP AND DOWN! HE SENT on the 3rd day of the month say april. well i was getting cheap! 10cent vali's, .............ect  Well i got pissed after 2 weeks and pretty much said hey just give me my money, you sent before to have me build up to a large order and burnt me! the old bait and switch! because it was no tracking! because it would have required signature. Well he gave me most of money but also gave me the big fuck you because i was rude.
    <br/>
    Sure as shit 6 weeks later! posted dated the 3rd of april that fucker was in my mailbox! I felt like an asshole!!!!!! I mean I am a very nice and easy going guy! soi told him! hey i got it! i owe you some money............ect. HE said i am a man of my word but you pissed me off i am done!
    <br/>
    so international give it 4 to 6 weeks depending on shipping method this was priority, Now, id stick with Fred on the 4 weeks after that then get concerned and talkk to vendor,
    <br/>
    Most well know and respected vendors say international do not even ask me for track orr dcn until 30 days! that is smart!
    <br/>
    well i hope my issue helps future SR users! Never rely or trust trackiing, I never check more than ever 3 to 4 days and that is smart do not draw to mch attn!
    <br/>
    be careful, smart and keep house clean if expecting, thats my advice and oh yeah fuck tracking its good to have to know its sent, thats about it
    <br/>
    Still just the ? about the registered letter!
    <br/>
    thank you all!!

    No worries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a package enter customs on a monday. The sunday of that week the tracker hadnt changed from "taken aside for customs inspection". I figured it was gone. Of course, on monday the tracker was updated and it showed it was only actually in customs for 7 minutes, but sat around waiting to get sorted by a local sorting facility for a week. Package arrived as it should have with no problems.
