    So a few months ago, I received a domestic customs letter, claiming they had a package of meth that I didn't order, nor have I ever used meth, so I didn't even know anything about it. However, I know it's dangerous to continue ordering packages after this because there's a chance your address is flagged, but I still had a package coming in, and the next day I received my MDMA right in my mailbox surprisingly, but luckily it was vacuum sealed. I thought about it and continued to make orders, and all of them arrived. I'd say 10+ orders since that incident, all domestic with no vacuum sealing, and there was never any problems with missing mail. I've tried to be safer however, so I ordered from my MDMA vendor who uses vacuum seal, my order was a gram of methylone. The shipping would usually take 2-4 days but it's been a week and two days since it was shipped and nothing arrived. I have to wait until resolution center for tracking numbers to be looked at because the seller wouldn't tell me the status of it yet. I'm hoping maybe it was marked in transit early and shipped out later, or something like that because I have no money for a new hard drive and just got a new laptop I prefer not to smash into pieces. What should I do? Is there any type of program able to wipe everything and reinstall my OS without having to get a new HD?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, a friend who is into drug experiencing with me, has had some MDPV shipped to his house, usually it'd be shipped to mine and I'd give it to him so I don't ruin his safety since I'm the one ordering and have a better chance of checking the mail. He's taken a lot of methylone and today at school, he didn't feel good and went home at approx. 8:30, texted me saying he was very depressed and his whole body hurt, just after-effects the next day, I don't know if he slept the night before though, I checked the DCN of the MDPV shipment and it says it was delivered at 10:58AM. I didn't text him back because I was at the doctors office at the time. When I got home at 3 or so, I texted him after seeing the status of the confirmation number, he didn't reply, I waited, I called, no answer, text again, no reply, call an hour later, no answer, I'm worried that he went home and fell asleep. He lives with his parents, who usually receive the mail, and I'm worried they've opened it and he's in some trouble. I have no idea what he'd say in this situation. I'm worried about him giving out my name or information since he's depressed. He also claimed to stopped doing any type of drugs since yesterday, and was going to give me the bag. I'm hoping he figured something out in time to save himself. I have a plan of leaving a note of gel cap sizes and supplements listed on my dresser, so in case I'm not home and my mail is opened by a relative, I have the chance of saving myself by claiming it's something for a homemade blend of anti-anxiety supplements. He hasn't called back or texted since I first sent him a message, guess all I can do is wait. What would you do if you were in this situation, in the event that you're unable to get the mail, and a relative/parent/wife were to open your package? (If you don't live with parents, just pretend.) Just wondering so maybe I can think of something better.

    Thanks both of you. I will go with axeman's recommendation since I've only used CCleaner to clean up my computer and nothing else, and that I've already downloaded and burned dban, seems like a good choice.

    Start by don't be an underage kid ordering things to your parents house or that of your friends parents.  Then implement proper grammatical formatting when typing so you appear to have an education level exceeding a 4th grader.  Honestly a lot of your post isn't even complete sentences.  You have included several topics in each (capital letter) - (period) section without any differentiation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On to your problems:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor probably didn't ship your methylone order.  Don't smash your laptop over this.  I doubt you could explain that to your parents. There is NEVER a situation where it would be necessary to destroy your laptop.  If you'd implemented halfway decent security measures you wouldn't ever even need to wipe your hard drive.  That being said, since you obviously have thrown security to the wind up till now, If you're really worried download a copy of 'boot and nuke' and use it.  Then dispose of the cd and bring your laptop to a shop; tell them you got a virus downloading porn and ask them to fix it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your friend probably went home and received the package, then binged.  If the level of writing you've exhibited is any indication of your intelligence level or that of your friend I wouldn't doubt in the least if he overdosed. STOP TEXTING HIM. Immediately.  You're incriminating yourself if anything untoward DID happen.  Drive by his house and see if he's home.  If the vendor had anything approaching stealth and his parents don't open his mail he'll be fine in that regard.  If he's not home I'd call the local hospitals and see if he's been admitted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously though, you've got a LOT of growing up to do.  Ask anymore questions you have regarding this issue, but then please leave the drug scene till you've matured another 5 years or so.  Trust me, it'll be a lot better for EVERYONE.

    Children texting about a package of drugs coming through the mail. Doesn't sound like a good idea.... At least establish a life on your own before you venture the consequences of the road.
