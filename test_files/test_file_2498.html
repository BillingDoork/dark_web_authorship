    So I am looking to buy some stuff from overseas to the US.  I am now wondering... any experienced US buyers, have any overseas destinations you would buy from / recommend?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How about countries you would not buy from and risk customs investigation aka Netherlands?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for your help

    I've ordered from NL, Germany, Canada. Only one order from NL didn't show up. However, I also had one domestic order not show up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's not so much about WHERE to buy from as WHO and WHAT. Buying easily-shipped goods from any country should be safe. Buying from trusted, reputable vendors who are known for stealthy shipping practice should be safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buying hard-to-conceal (smelly? large?) items OR from newbie vendors who haven't figured shipping out yet should be avoided.

    I'm not looking to buy marijuana or anything smelly per se.  Honestly MDMA / Cocaine are my choices mostly.  And its always personal I don't buy large amounts.  I have just heard people talking on the forums badly about Netherlands to the US since a lot of drugs come out of NL it seems.  I do check reviews of all vendors before purchasing, I was just wondering if purchasing from other countries was safer than others.  I am by no means rich and don't like to blow money on shipments that won't arrive, even though that is a risk you take, aka I like to minimize my risk as much as possible!

    I've had almost no trouble overall. I've gotten packages from tons of foreign countries without issue. If it doesn't show up, it's much more likely that the seller has screwed up than it was seized by customs.
