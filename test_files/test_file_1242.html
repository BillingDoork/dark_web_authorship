    Has anyone had this done, is it acceptable etiquette? What are the potential negatives?

    sounds like a bad idea to me.
    <br/>
    just imagine it gets seized and the LE comes to your workplace.
    <br/>
    its shitty enough to get caught, you don't want your boss and coworkers to know about it.

    Same here. Bad idea. Doesn't offer any additional benefits/protection and only presents potential consequences. If the shit were to hit the fan, you'd still have legal problems, except you will also get fired.

    Not the best option. Your business with not stand up for you in the slightest as it is bad business for them to do so. Perhaps you have a unique situation. Also, maybe envelopes would be fine but I wouldn't send packages at all. I don't know anyone that receives packages to their work, lol. Best of luck, and maybe try a PO Box?

    I have done this several times. Employee mailboxes are cubbies on a wall, which double for intra/inter-office mail. We have several international employees on VISAs, so packages come in from all over the world on a regular basis. With a reliable vendor, I ship packages to employee boxes that are away on vacation, sick leave, or business. Cannabis from the Road is the only thing that keeps me sane through long work hours laboring over software and office politics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep in mind, however, that what others have mentioned: Job Loss. This is a serious issue if you are using your real name and not prepared to effectively evade the consequences. If you get arrested on your own time, it might be possible to keep your current form of employment--and keep such a black mark off your resume. Otherwise, you should be prepared to turn your recreation into your livelihood: retail narcotics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good Luck.
