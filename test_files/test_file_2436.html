    Alright..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So here's my situation:  I live in a remote location, with a small-ish size town (&lt;4000 people).  The surrounding towns are a minimum of a 2 hour drive 1 way.. so there is limited access to other post offices outside of my own.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Up until a few months ago, my postal facility would take all incoming packages and ship them to the states main processing facility and would do all the postmarking at this facility.. resulting in ZERO markings linking the originating town(my town) on the package..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This was fine and dandy for me.  But as of late, the policies have apparently changed, and now every package leaving my town is marked with my towns postal mark.  This sucks.  I ship a lot of packages and hate the fact my small town is being labeled on my packages.. this is a great way to single myself out should a package go astray and land in the wrong hands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can and have moved up to 50 packages a day through this facility.  I really want to figure out a way to make my town not show up on the package in any sort of way.  I would love to avoid making the 4 hour drive to drop the packages off in another city post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've thought about finding a secondary shipper in another city, but this adds shipping time as well as another fool into the equation.. something that smells fishy to me..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else had this problem and found a solution?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does any one have any ideas?  Or thoughts on the matter?
    <br/>
    I would love to discuss them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace,
    <br/>
