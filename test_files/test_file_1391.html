    So im gonna order 10g of molls, and this will be my first international order so im a tad nervous. Im just wondering, god forbid, it got seized by customs. What would happen ? Would they do a CD? I mean my place is clean except maybe if they did an extensive search on my laptop, they would find tor downloaded and maybe some drug searches on google lol.

    Goddamn scarface, you should chill out with your international operation if you're so worried. Those girls weren't going to fuck you anyway.  :o

    Then order a smaller amount. If it's making you nervous, how is possibly worth it? WTF could any of us possibly say to convince you it was "safe", or "safe enough"?

    Generally with customs seizures you just get a 'love letter'.  I wouldn't worry much about a CD for 10g of molly.  It really wouldn't be worth their time.
