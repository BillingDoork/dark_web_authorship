    Hey, I live overseas and use a mail-forwrding service (such as one provided by ARAMEX) to conduct my clearnet online shopping. US stores ship to my po box, and the service automatically forwards it to my home address abroad. At least one vendor told me that he often ships to clients in the middle east through one of those services. I was wondering if any others (vendors and customers alike) have any experience or knowledge about using these services and how easy it might be to receive personal-use amounts through them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In some countries, letters from such companies do not go through customs, but packages do. That is a plus, however I wonder if those companies conduct their own security measures on letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone know?
