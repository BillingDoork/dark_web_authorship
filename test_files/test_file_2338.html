    hey there, OP.. ordering from supertrips means you'll be settling in. i'm on day 26 of my order and still have no indication as to when it'll arrive. if you can exercise patience, then ST is (as close to) a sure thing (as you can get) on this site. i've had four successful, quadruple-digit transactions with the vendor in the span of the last five months. the package exterior utilizes printed labels and a company logo sticker to increase authenticity; yet, the package contents are only concealed within one opaque layer, which leaves something to be desired. just wanted to offer another perspective..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck with your decision!! :)

    see, danflan.. you're already asking the wrong questions, lol. with supertrips, once you place the order.. you forget about it. i'd recommend doing at least $1k, so he doesn't make you finalize. then just sit back and wait until it arrives. at this rate, it's looking like a solid 25-30 days to get to the US of A.

    Any vendor that uses stealth outer packaging, flattening, mbb bags and printed labels is doing all they can.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like the other poster said, if its opened on a multiple gram or bulk order its game over.

    You do your best to prevent that from ever happening.

    Realistically, if customs opens a shipment of 500-1000 pills, you'll probably be getting a controlled delivery.

    at least that's what we all speculate, right? lol.. don't get me wrong, my instinct tells me the same thing. but perhaps we've fallen prey to some type of 'brainwashing' effect? regardless, if customs DID intcercept it, which might be the case less than 1% of the time (thank goodness), you still have plausible deniability: anyone can send a package via the postal system. if you use this site, then you need to keep your disk drive clean and make sure you can easily remove everything incriminating from the premises in a pinch. but yeah, it's risky. the statistics are in our favor, though.. go to the 'shipping' thread and look for pine's post about package success rates. get a better feel for the numbers :)

    I agree completely that there is a much greater chance of the package getting through than it getting intercepted. And, legally, you'd still have deniability. I guess the real question is: What is the lowest quantity of drugs that merits a controlled delivery, instead of a love-letter?

    I think they would do a controlled delivery for 100+ pills or 10g+ of mdma. i remember seeing a pill bust of 100 pills with the cops acting like they were hot shit. but who really knows..

    i'd say we're setting the bar appropriately. 10-20g or so would probably do the trick for a controlled delivery. i think, primarily, LEO is going to ask themselves 'what can be gained from this if we pursue it?'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they're gonna have to mobilize a unit and come to your hometown. i live in BFE, lol. i don't know where the closest DEA/FBI office is (i'm sure there's one relatively close), but i doubt it's housed with a tactical team ready to move at the push of a button. so they're gonna have to do some traveling to get to me. remember that customs is separate from the entity that would escalate the issue. they just pass it on to the appropriate governing body. however, the USPS "cops"can supersede local law enforcement if they choose to do so. i actually came across an article on the clearnet where they took a 'bust' away from local cops in california just to give the package back to the postal inspector so they could do the typical controlled delivery. i'm sure there are other agencies that can overrule the USPS, though..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    say it is the local cops coming to bust, though.. then i'm not even sweatin' it. my local PD would have a better time nailing jello to a wall than being able to prosecute me (so long as my safebox was not on the premises). now, if you live in a metropolitan.. that mindset will not apply to you! more people = more money = more resources. mainly, it's the feds that scare me :(

    he's right. this is our single most saving grace. you MUST have your wits about you when interacting with the USPS employees. i use a PO box (screw you guys if you disapprove, lol).. i'm saving my roommates from being held liable in the event that something should happen. call it social responsibility, haha. anyways, we should all be AWARE enough to know something's going on around us if it doesn't feel right. look for vehicles that aren't typically around. pay attention to the regular deliverers. observe and denote any non-normative characteristics. and do NOT sign if something's off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    furthermore, it's somewhat of a cost/benefit analysis: will busting you be worth the resources consumed in the process?
    <br/>
    above all else, do this: imagine how the news headline would read if your order was seized..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "LAW ENFORCEMENT BUSTS PERPETRATORS FOR ATTEMPTING TO ACQUIRE FIVE GRAMS OF 'ECSTASY' FROM EUROPE"
    <br/>
    vs.
    <br/>
    "LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERCEPTS PARCEL FROM EUROPE CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY $25,000 WORTH OF ECSTASY"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so let's say.. if you're ordering enough to see it make a news headline, then you're gonna get a controlled delivery. just a thought!!
