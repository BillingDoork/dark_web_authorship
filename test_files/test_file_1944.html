    My friend made 2 orders and both did not arrive after 2 weeks (international).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    She does not receive any mail for herself this 2 weeks plus but there are for others in recipients of the unit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And there is NO seizure letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, does postal detain all your packaged if your address is flagged? What the hell is going on?

    This isn't coming from my experience but from what i've read around that forum, that people who even had bulk orders sometimes seized and their other orders would still come through

    I've heard of international orders being held in customs for up to 30 days for no actual reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember the people at customs are by no means geniuses. They're just average workers. You don't need to go to college to work at customs..
