    Hello, new timer looking for a fun experiment with LSD... After reading the wiki, what to do/not; I'm asking for your experience and advice towards a safe and successful reception. While reading through the forums I see that using your real name is risky business, but I already have a small PO Box which is under my name, address, and ID. The flow of mail to this Box is very stagnant. I do not plan to order large quantities, but rather small strips periodically and domestically. I wouldn’t think simple letters to get intercepted, but that is why I’m here. Any help is appreciative.

    Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it at all. Especially considering the product (very discreet to ship) and the quantity (hardly worth LE's time) I think you can feel confident in placing an order without resorting to jumping though hoops. Just my two cents...

    People have done a lot more risky things than that. I can't see ordering lsd to your already established po box being much danger. People order ounces of weed at a time here lol
