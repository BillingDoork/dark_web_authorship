    Im expecting an order, and I got one of those post office slips in the mail that they give you when they need to you sign for your package, only this one says "postage due".  I have no idea whether the vendor may have fucked up on the postage--they are being less than cooperative and insisting "all their orders always go through".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, Im definitely veering away from the idea of showing up at the PO and claiming it, because a) that would require showing ID and b) would be putting myself at risk of arrest.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But part of me thinks that if they found something in there and were going to try to arrest me for it, wouldn't they do a controlled delivery?   Is this just lazy policing or could this be a genuine thing where I just need to pay them and Im good?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One thing I have thought about is leaving the postage slip taped to my box, signed with the addresees signature, and with some stamps attached: more than I think they could possibly need.  Im wondering if that would present the same plausiable deniability I rely on in the first place with having a box I can access that is not in my name--ie the person who it "really" belongs to could be accessing it without me having anything to do with it.
    <br/>

    Opinions?  Experiences?  Help?

    If your package is heavier than the postage (the amount of stamps on the envelope) allows for then you will be required to make a payment in person or send the required amount of stamps to your local PO. It's happened to me in the past, nothing to worry about. Now, my post has gone completely AWOL, that is something to worry about!
