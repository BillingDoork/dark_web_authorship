    I went to the post office, and got some stamps and delivery confirmation note. The worker told me that i have to come back to the post office once i put my DCN on my package, so they can stamp the receipt, or something like that, or else it will look suspicious. Do i really have to go back there? she said it would be suspicous. should i forget her comment and still send the package with DCN without going back to the PO, or what?

    I wouldn't get it stamped.  They always stamp it and have you write down the address on the reciept.  I think its more for your own benefit.

    As usual the PO worker doesn't know what she is talking about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can put the DCN on yourself. Add up the price of the DCN ($0.75) to the postage and you are set. They keep stacks of them in the lobbies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did she perhaps mean that if your receipt (the other half of the DCN that doesn't get stuck on the box) was not postmarked then it would not be as valid a form of proof of shipment? She may mean it would possibly look suspicious to the person you were sending the package to that your receipt was not marked, if they challenged you on whether you actually shipped.

    you do not need to get your piece of the dcn stamped. i dont know why she would tell you that. just drop it in a blue box with enough postage to pay for the mailing and the dcn (as long as its under 13 ozs.).

    I wondered how you vendors sent packages with dcn without dropping it off at the post office.  I've sent plenty of packages with dcn but none that were illicit in nature so I always just did it all at the PO and figured that's how it had to be done.  Good to know in case I ever go into vending.  I would imagine you all put a little extra postage on the package if you drop it in a blue box to make sure you dont have the delivery woman knocking on your customer's door for more money if your scale was off compared to the post office's.
