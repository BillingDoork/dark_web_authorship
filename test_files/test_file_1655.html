    Yesterday a friend of mine told me that she wants to give me her perscription of 100 Roxy/mo for me to resell here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before I shell out $500 for a vendor account I want to make sure that I've got all my bases covered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was hoping you guys could help me get an idea of how people expect to receive their painkillers in the mail.
    <br/>
    As a buyer, stealth has been important to me, but I never buy pills or opioids here due to the price, so I have no idea what is considered adequate for domestic US shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is a bubble mailer with stamps the standard? Flat rate box?
    <br/>
    Do they need to be put in a mylar bag, do they need to be vacuum sealed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only other thing I'm concerned about is tracking/delivery confirmation.
    <br/>
    I understand it's getting harder and harder to do this anonymously.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How are other vendors dealing with this?
    <br/>
    Is the only other option to only allow established buyers and have a no refund policy?

    So you figured out how to reply, but you have nothing of value to say?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dunno if you've tried to use the search function but it's fucking dismal.
    <br/>
    More than half of the time I get the "last post was less than 5 sec ago" error and I have to keep clicking the new identity button to even get it to work at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then when you do get the search to work there are no advanced options, so searching terms that are really common such as "Shipping" or "pills" comes up with a lot of irrelevant posts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is a general question about how people prefer to receive pills in the mail, if you have no opinion or advice please refrain from further cluttering the forum with useless posts.

    Just a heads up, the "new identity" button does nothing for hidden services. It merely switches exit nodes.
