    Just an idea for the information vendors put on their return labels for stealth shipping purposes:   One thing thing that makes me nervous is when vendors refer to themselves as fake companies that sell "natural supplements" "vitamins" or even "whole foods/health foods." type items.   Like "Jim Bob's All Natural Food Products"  for example.  (Not one I have actually received.)   I am much more comfortable with something "non-edible" for lack of a better term.    In general, I think it is safer just to go with a very generic sounding name like "J &amp; C Associates" or even just a regular first/last name. Cell phone batteries, computer parts, or anything electronic seems a safer and perhaps more plausible "fake" company idea to me........again just my opinion.   (I am probably being overly cautious or paranoid here.)    ::) ::)   Thanks folks......... 8)

    I remember a buyer complaining about a sellers choice of business name which was "Silken Road"
    <br/>
    The vendor actually came on the forums to explain his choice  ::)

    and if you're shipping to oz, mention nothing about foodstuffs/organic cosmetics etc on your label.  They're really uptight about people bringing nature stuff into the country so don't be surprised if it gets opened and doesn't make it.

    not so sure about the electronics bit though, now they ask you "does this contain anything liquid, lithium batteries, etc". I wrote cell phone on a label once, and they refused to ship becuase some new law states you cant send lithium batteries (although i think thats international only). But when i shipped a priority flat rate domestic recently, they said "does this contain lithium batteries"....just a thought? not sure if that law applies domestic now....
