    I realize there are a lot of Express mail threads out there and I've read through a lot of them.  I've seen where the list of things that the USPS looks out for when trying to identify drug packages and using express mail is one of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm trying to decide between express vs priority for this one order.  I'll be order a decent amount of cheeba chew edibles and the vendor states they're coming from Colorado.  This will be my largest order on SR to date out of about 25 orders and would be the first time I've used express so I'm a little nervous.  The vendor has great feedback of 100% and appears to use good stealth from what I can tell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think I should stick with express for this order or is priority for these edibles out of Colorado a better choice?  My gut tells me use priority, but I hate waiting days for my packages so I'm just so tempted to use express.  What do you think?

    It is possible that a package from Colorado will attract extra attention especially if your shipping internationally. But customs is not used much within the USA. Customs means drug dogs. I would take the slower shipping option especially if your ordering a big amount. Express shipments can attract more attention because just like you no one wants to wait.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edibles are pretty easy to ship. I think you can trust the feedback.

    Trust your gut. Colorado is def considered a source state and the Postal Inspection Service has already conducted operations targeting weed (incl edibles) shipped from there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From The Denver Post last year:

     These are busy times for postal inspectors in Colorado.

     Investigators at the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in the state said that, anecdotally, they have seen a dramatic increase in the amount of marijuana people here are trying to mail out of the state.

     So great is the number of marijuana mailings that the Postal Inspection Service in Colorado has created a separate process for dealing with packages suspected of containing only a small amount of drugs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Those packages are routed to a "mail recovery center," putting the burden on their sender or recipient to come claim them, according to several search warrants filed in federal court

    That article was from when medical marijuana was legal. Now that it's entirely legalized I'm sure their seizures &amp; reroutes have increased. Why risk Express, esp if it's a bigger order? Much better to wait an extra day or two then never get the package at all.
