    Hey everyone,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I wanted to let everyone who needs one, to know where to source them because I had an extremely ignorant response from PharmacyPowder when I was trying to explain how I've used them when freight shipping bulk weed in cement garden structures on pallets across coasts. He tried to tell me ONLY THE DEA COULD HAVE THESE ONES WITH LIGHT SENSORS. And that I was talking about some movie called "snitch" where apparently they do the same thing. I think someone is letting their minds be held to what they've "learned" in movies. Anything's possible, just look at this market... you think a light sensing gps isnt?

     What I would be interested in, at least as a test, would be to enclose a light and x-ray sensitive indicator inside the mail, perhaps some kind of photographic film, inside shipments but in an inconspicious way. I'm sure this could be done very cheaply, probably for less than a dollar.

    Edit: For film I guess you could use one of those black photography bags that they use to take film out of cameras when a dark room isn't available. I know that holes are poked in a lot of packages though as the easiest customs check so the tiniest amount of light over time could make the film look exposed regardless of whether the pack was opened. The light sensor has a light "level" or intensity meter so you can tell if it's 0.1lux(lowest reading possible while not being in a completely sealed box) or 50lux(definitely under inspection)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not saying feasible for every transaction here but for buyers who make enough of a %/$ return per pack this safety investment might work for them. ANd most of all I needed to prove this shit existed for civilian use.

    It SEEMS like having an updating gps would set off all sorts of bells and whistles at the post office for obvious reasons and possibly cause unnecessary scrutiny.
