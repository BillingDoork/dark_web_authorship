    Something I've been wondering for a while, but why is it if a vendor provides a DCN to SR resolution in a dispute it is automatically considered proof of delivery? What stops the vendor from just mailing an empty box to some random address in your zip code? Or providing a random DCN that has nothing to do with your order at all?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just because they can provide a DCN doesn't prove they actually sent anything to the address you provided when you ordered. Someone enlighten me please.

    Nothing is perfect.  A legit vendor could pull that move once or twice but it wont keep flying.

    Nothing stops that...but if the buyer was saying he got a package it was empty...then obviously the DCN would show delivered and the buyer would agree to that...the buyer is only disputing that the box was empty...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can not tell you  how many times a newbie has proposed this question...and the thing the newbie is not taking into account is this...VENDORS ARE NOT HEAR TO SCAM!!!! We make way to much money....to pull of a scam like that...of course it  has happened...and if it did it would be noted in the notes...and if another buyer had that problem...they would start looking at the vendor...but that is what the feedback system is for.. and why you should go with a trusted vendor that has been on the road for a while..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But again...realize that vendors are not scammers...you will not get scammed on here if you choose the right vendor...and it is WAY more likely that the buyer is lying...then a vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In fact....so YOU KNOW...there are a lot more scam attempts by buyers...then vendors...They can change name in a second...they have nothing to lose...  but I have to tell you...in my year+ in all my orders to over 500 different people....I have never had a buyer try to scam me...so that tells you how much scamming is going on. The truth is...there is not much going on ...on either side...bit that is boring to talk about...and for new people...they want  to hear everything 100 times before they man up and order. It has ALWAYS been like that...and I assume it will continue  And some buyers..dive in head first.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But the fact is this...nothing is perfect and anything can be done one time...but in the end...nothing is worth it and people will be honest.
