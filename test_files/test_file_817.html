    I just placed my first order on the SR, after a long and arduous process of attempting to receive coins in the first place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bought some paraphernalia from SR user ("vicious86") ... my question is, without getting too specific, is it safe to have such materialistic things like... perhaps needles/syringes, or a smoking pipe for example? I am assuming the packaging methods are safe from these vendors considering they all have 100% feedback ratings (100). I am just kind of scared now because... like, how? I guess. How are they able to get through, tactfully? Maybe I am overthinking this. In fact, I am almost hesitant to place my next order due to the fact that I have these coming. But I would rather that I get them all rolling so I can get them ASAP.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wish I could've got BitCoin sooner so I could have placed my order on Monday but due to the fact BitInstant was down... yeah it just became a lot harder, that's all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers, everybody -- twopack

    I've seen you on these forums and my first answer is: yes you are over-thinking it! Ha! You are just nervous, and careful, I like that. You've obviously put in some leg work to make this safe, so why are you nervous? Particularly if you just ordered legal items, then no need to actually worry, you can do that with the illegal orders. As long as you do all the tor, PGP, vendor research, etc. then you are taking very little risk. It will get less nerve-wracking, but don't get sloppy. Stay careful. Peace!

    Thank you Mainstay, I remember you from the Newbie forums ... lol, I only just recently made it here myself. And yes, I am careful. Probably too careful, but whatever. It just blows my mind that this kind of thing is even possible (speaking of SR as a whole). Having ... neat-o things delivered to your door? Like, wow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, I just went ahead and posted my other order... but I know, in the event there's a problem, I have no clue why I was sent that _____ in the mail.

    I've heard the advice to not have more than one illegal thing in transit at a time, so that if it gets confiscated, there's not another package coming to the same address.
    <br/>
    Also, it helps if you often have regular packages coming to your house anyway. My roommate loves to buy little knick-knacks off of ebay for like 2 dollars, so we already get weird, suspicious international packages anyway (I'm assuming those are all knick-knacks, maybe she's ordering off of SR just like me...)

    Youll be fine! Youll be shocked/ surprised with how awesome many of the vendors shipping tactics are.

    Thanks for your replies, everybody -- so, I am feeling a little better about the whole situation, but still pretty nervous. If I could do it again, I would probably have not ordered both things to come in around the same time. But I have since received messages from both vendors that put me more at ease, for the most part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Both of them are very highly rated and have been on SR for 6-months and a year, respectively. One package (the more illegal of the two, probably) is supposed to get here first. Either Saturday or Monday. The other is supposed to come "Monday, Tuesday at the latest". So they are coming a little bit separate from each other.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The biggest thing that upset me was the vendor who sold me the paraphernalia was up front about "no stealth" but reassured me because it's not illegal and he wrapped it in a paper bag before putting it in the envelope. lol wtf??? I don't really think he's correct about it not being illegal but whatever. I certainly can't get them legally/without a script where I live. My reassurance comes in the form of him being a member for 1 year and has like 99.8% approval rating. The other package I expect to have stealth because everyone always compliments his "brilliant stealth" in the feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But anyway, it is what it is now. I will keep everyone posted as things progress... but yeah, maybe other people can tell me about their own first orders/experiences so I will feel better lol ...

    My first few orders were extremely nerve wracking, I went through every possible thing that could go wrong in my head multiple times and thought about it day and night. The second I opened the mailbox and saw my order there though, everything evaporated as I did a happy dance and darted into my house with it. In my opinion, all the stress and worry was totally worth it for that moment, as well as many high moments that were enjoyed after that! My advice to you is to carefully comb these forums, there is so much information and tons of good tips for using this site safely.

    dealextrem is a great way to receive crappy priority letters with legal stuff to your address too. It's a HK website selling thousands of often crappy quality gadgets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can order things lower than 1$ with free international shipping. Their customer service is quite nice, and who doesn't need that USB charging cable we all lose constantly ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not sure it helps much to receive some priority letters before ordering anything serious, but at least it may help you experiment stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, good luck with your first order, you are right to start slow. Take your time with small orders before going any further.
