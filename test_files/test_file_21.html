    Background: I'm relatively new to the road and have a low transaction count. I'll try to keep this short and sweet
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I placed an order about 2 weeks ago and last week in worry I contacted my excellent vendor, and he informed me there had been some delay time due to the storm (shipping traffic across the US had delays, as I'm sure most people here know) and my goods would be to me very soon. I completely understood. Now today, the package didn't arrive so I reluctantly asked my vendor for the DCN, which he provided me with very quickly and also informed me the package was delivered today. Shit. So I double check to make sure he's (she's) right. He's right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Package was delivered early this morning it said. My mail comes at the same time everyday, and never as early as the DCN said. I've also been checking my mail promptly around the time the mail man comes everyday, to ensure less chance of something being stolen out of box. I got nothing today. No mail Whatsoever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I tell my vendor this, and that I'm sure he's skeptical to believe me, being I'm new and the DCN speaks for myself.  (although i am newish to the road I trust my vendor very much. He or she has always been straight up and their rating speaks for itself.) The Vendor suggest that there could have been a mix up with the post office or Postman and that I should either go to the post office and ask there, or ask my postman directly about the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So here's where I need help! To me, asking the postman or the post office about where is my package of illegal contraband seems EXTREMELY sketchy. I very much appreciate the seller working through this problem with me but I'm not sure how secure (Smart) it is to do that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think? Just cut my losses and say fuck it, or ask a couple Questions about it? I really have no idea what to do. The seller also told me this happened to another customer of his recently and he ended up receiving his package by doing this. I want my package but not at the risk of getting fucked, So any advice you folks might have would be very much appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks,

    Personally I would never ask the postman. If it doesn't come, it doesn't come.
    <br/>
    However, I have heard of users doing this with no qualms.

    The Order was not Mdma from germany.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, microRNA, I thought about that but i'm 99.9999999% sure I sent the address correctly. I reviewed it several times, but who knows i guess?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully this is just a mix up with the post and it will be here today. I'm seriously having my doubts though.

    Give it a couple days.  More than once (on legal packages) the post office has fucked up and scanned the wrong package.  If it hasn't shown up tomorrow call the post office and give them the DCN.  Tell them it's an order off eBay and if they say the address on the DCN isn't yours, say the eBay seller must have given you the wrong one.

    Thanks for the advice Jack2324. I think I'll try that
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's an update.
    <br/>
    The package still hasn't arrived and I just released the funds in there entirety to the vendor. I've been trying to catch my postman the last couple of days but keep missing him. At this point, I know it's possible it could come but I'm pretty much just cutting my losses and saying fuck it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks everyone for your input, If anything else happens I'll write an update.

    I am waiting on a late letter as well. Priority with dcn. I asked the vendor to check and he found a group of his package drops had not even had the dcn scanned by intake at usps including mine. I checked as well and no dice. We have our business situation in hand but the multitude of probabilities has me sweeping house...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stealth for this vendor is superb so my hopes are up that it is just the storms but if anyone has good advice for any LE scenarios please advise. Harm reduction is paramount.
