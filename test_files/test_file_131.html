    How many of you have had success with shipping weed to the US? Or how many in the US have successfully received weed from the UK?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ask because a very good friend of mine would like to buy some Highgrade from a UK vendor, however, he is very concerned about USPS cracking down on stuff like postal fraud and drugs shipping with more diligence, x-raying individual packages and using sniffer dogs more, etc. His father works for the mail service and does not think he would be able to get away with buying from SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want him to be able to enjoy the best quality bud available as I have been. I am in the UK, he is in Tennessee. I just don't want him to get caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Opinions from anyone with experience in these circumstances?

    He only has one guy who he gets his weed from and it's always the same stuff, B or C grade. I told him about SR and the menus some of the weed vendors have and I swear his mouth started watering, lol. It's the least I could do, he's an awesome guy.
