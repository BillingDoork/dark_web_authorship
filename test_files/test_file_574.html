    i recieved a letter on monday to pick up my package from my normal local post office which i usually do with things from ebay and such, but i thought tabs (1000) would fit in a normal envelope? but i have no idea how big the packaging is... like if its big because its elaborate to evade detection by customs? anyway its been 3 days (ive been away). ps. I am in australia and got the tabs from a very trusted seller, tyler (tyler said i should be good to pick it up, but he didnt no what country i was in and i dont want to harrass him if i can come here :))

    I'd pick it up, It'd look much more suspicious if you left it there. If things turn to the worst, just play it out as if you don't know what it is, and you just thought it was a package you ordered from Ebay, or Amazon, but it just came late.  ;)

    Mate,
    <br/>
    I also got a bunch of tabs from tyler today, i'm not going to discuss packaging, but think of it this way, tabs are in fact blotters, blotters are paper (blotting paper like your Pop had on his desk before PCs) so the 'package' is going to not be a 'package at all, do you get my drift? You're probably only signing because its been sent from the UK recorded delivery so that Tyler can prove he sent it from his end in case of a dispute. Remember, in every respect, the mailing of this SR items is done exactly the same way as any legit item of value, to do it any other way is exactly how to raise a red flag on your shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think you are worrying over nothing at all, i have had deliveries on SR for a year, from US EU UK signed, unsigned, big packages small packages, you name it, never got lost, never got a love letter from customs. go get your tabs, and enjoy! (And a + for setting your mind at ease, and showing you how it works would be nice, bro)
