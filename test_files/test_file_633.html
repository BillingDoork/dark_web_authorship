    So, after reading the buyers guide and acquainting myself with how SR works, I'm still left with a question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The buyers guide states to get a PO box, and whatever you do, do not sign for your package. This makes sense to me, however I see other people here posting about how they get their packages delivered straight to their house, and even some people saying that they sign for their packages. Would anyone help me out in explaining the risks associated with the different methods? I ask because honestly, leaving the PO box out of the equation would make it much easier for me, however I am more interested in my security than being lazy.

     If you rent I see no added risk by having the package sent to your house. Owning the house you get deliveries at may create complications if you ordered a "trafficking" amount of stuff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some vendors have options for tracking or you may have to sign for larger packages to protect the vendors interest. I suggest you avoid signing if possible.

    Ah, so owning the house its getting delievered too should not be an issue as long as I'm not ordering too much? Thats good, as I'm only planning on ordering a very little amount of the ol' whacky backy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess I'll look into getting a PO box, though. Thanks for the help

    If you are just getting a little weed I suggest ordering it to your house unless you live in a strict state.

    Only problem i see with signing is, in the case of an intercept, it makes a controlled delivery much easier.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But for small O/S orders, and if it gives you more guarantee of delivery, then i would sign, some vendors prefer this.

     Also registered packages usually have more valueable items, and in portugal that means its usually open to charge taxes on the importation.... i think its like that everywhere...
