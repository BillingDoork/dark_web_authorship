    So I got a peach redelivery slip in my mail box (omitted). Where it says today's date it reads (omitted) and where is says available for pick up after it reads (omitted). It is described as a parcel, and express mail. None of the signature required boxes are checked. On the back it reads "We will redeliver OR you or your agent can pick up your mail at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then in the column below it says "1)check all that apply in section 3, sign in section 2 below, leave this notice where the carrier can see it. 2)sign here to authorize redelivery or to authorize an agent to sign for you. 3)Redeliver (enter day of the week) or Leave item at my address or Refused.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can also set this up online.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was expecting (omitted) in the mail. What should I do, am I pretty much fucked on this order?

    No, it means they are holding the package at the local USPS store posted on the back of that sheet. I had that in my mailbox too when I missed the mailman for a bulk order of some cali bud.

    I understand that they want me to go to that particular USPS location, but is this indicative of a controlled delivery? Like, when I go in to get my package, will I be walking back out in cuffs? I'm just nervous. I mean, yeah, it could've been too big for the mailbox or whatever, but I remember the shipper saying he used (omitted), so I can't imagine (omitted). I also kind of see my letter carrier walking up to my house every day and I don't recall him ever taking extra time trying to navigate something into the box. Hell, just today I saw him put some mail in my across the street neighbors mailbox, and then turn around and toss a larger parcel (perhaps a large catalog) on their porch quite haphazardly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly, just trying to be safe.

    When I put in the article number on the USPS site, this is what it told me:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We attempted to deliver your item at (date and time omitted) in (ADDRESS OMITTED) and a notice was left because an authorized recipient was not available. You may arrange redelivery by visiting www.usps.com/redelivery or calling 800-ASK-USPS, or may pick up the item at the Post Office indicated on the notice. If this item is unclaimed after five days then it will be returned to the sender. Information, if available, is updated periodically throughout the day. Please check again later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Authorized Recipient??? What does that mean? I was under the impression my package would require no signature. Am I reading too deep into this, or does it have the makings of something bad?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am considering either scheduling redelivery online and saying just to leave the package at the door because no one will be home, or just going and picking it up. I just don't want to have to sign anything or walk into a trap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone have any experience with this?

    heyyy, take a deep breath. you're gonna be okay :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one will always receive this slip when claiming any item declared as 'registered' mail. this is, unfortunately, how your package was shipped by the vendor. therefore, you're going to have to sign that slip at some point. you can even have someone else sign for it, if you'd like? a warm body just has to be present to account for receipt of the item. nothing you've described makes me inclined to believe it's a controlled delivery. optionally, you can go to a local post office listed on the slip during normal hours of operation to claim your package. good luck! respond back and let us know everything went alright!!

    Well, I went and picked up my package and it went off without a hitch. The packaging, however, really threw me for a loop, as well as the fact that their was an (omitted) in all (omitted).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Turns out it wasn't even one of my packages from the road, just some (omitted) I had ordered from (omitted) about (omitted) ago with the intent to (omitted). Oddly though, my money was (omitted) by the (omitted) a (omitted) ago after they said they (omitted). So I guess I got some free product. Score?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, guess it's back to the waiting game for me. I feel like an idiot for the mix up lol.
