    so i ordered 1 pound of weed from my usual guy wendsday morning and finalized early when he asked me to and he sent it out that same wed afternoon and gave me the tracking code the same day so it should have showed up thursday morning the next day like it normaly does but it didnt. and then it didnt show up today either should i be worried? could it have gotten taken by a mail inspecter? the tracking code said it was in my city yesterday but im a little scared to check it again now. what should i do?

    Two days is a little soon to be worrying about it.  I've had express packages to 3-5 days sometimes, one even took over a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the tracking shows it's in your city it will probably show up in a day or so.

    It would probably help if you could give us a few more details who was the seller, how was their packaging before, what does your tracking info currently say etc etc..

    Hey man you may want to take that link down,, calimeds is good people and work pretty much under stealth anymore. Soo they probably don't want that up there. They sort of had some drama on the forums awhile back with another vendor whom I can't recall at the moment and went into stealth mode with the customers they had. Their bud is very very nice though and they usually don't rape you on prices so make friends with them if you can :P I have my suspicions they are another top vendor working a second profile but I could never prove it haha! Either way you should probably take that link down and delete this thread unless they give you the go ahead to leave it up. I promise you'll get your shit but you've seen their packaging already so you already know that ha! Smoke a j and chill out you'll probably get it today ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: And if you requested the cheese you're a lucky man or lady. That shit is somethin else I tell ya, I wish I wasn't out  :-[ Cali hook me up for my little commercial here if you see this! Haha jk jk! Not really though!  :P Fuck it's too early

    Haaahahahaa way to ruin sr's best kept secret guys!!!! Just kidding im pretty sure he or they told me the other day that they were planning on coming out of stealth for a few days anyway and taking in some new customers whiiiiiiich means no more keeping them all to myself :( I know im a selfish prick lolololololol But definitely try the cheese like the other guy said. Im pretty sure thats their staple strain or whatever you want to call it and it sells like motherfuckin hot cakes in my city
    <br/>
    <br/>
    yea i just went and checked and they're not in stealth anymore so im guessing its fair game for everybody  ::)

    With all due respect, and remember I said all due respect but lol  ;D ;D ;D ;D You totally wigged out! What made you so noid...let us in on what product you were on that made you go googoo? Was it good old fashion herb paranoia or something a little harder?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was the vendor  &gt;:( with you for putting this up or were they  8) about you loosing your ish?

    Very nice nuggz, I love when Mary has that deep purple thing going on ;) I understand why you wigged out. FE'ing is nerve wrecking and on top of that there was a bit of weight coming in so the anxiety level would definitely increase. I'm glad for you that the vendor was cool.

    FUUUUUUUCK NO, I wish. My frat brother would let me get an 8th for 50 because we were like blood, he sold them for 75...and he was the cheap weed man.  I was in the deep south and the only ganja we got at market price was Mexican shwagg. I recently moved to the east coast and after getting fucked 40 a g  &gt;:( I found and figured out the road ;D

    Fuck I hope the lb I have coming from them looks even half as good as that lol! They didn't tell me what strain I'd be getting either but that stuff looks dope. I just wish they would get rid of the "have to fe if your orders over $1500" policy but I guess I understand. I  hate trusting someone I have never met before in my life with my money but I guess it's just a necessary evil.  They've got the good shit and that's what I need God save me

    I placed an order with calimeds yesterday.  saw it was marked in transit last night.  i deleted (by accident) a message from calimeds last night, asked to resend and this morning they did.  It gave me a choice of strains and said it would be sent once I finalized.  The issue is that i chose priority with escrow and my buyer stats are flawless after being on SR over a year or two.  sounds fishy, but i hope i'm wrong.

     I placed an order with calimeds yesterday.  saw it was marked in transit last night.  i deleted (by accident) a message from calimeds last night, asked to resend and this morning they did.  It gave me a choice of strains and said it would be sent once I finalized.  The issue is that i chose priority with escrow and my buyer stats are flawless after being on SR over a year or two.  sounds fishy, but i hope i'm wrong.

     Hey thanks for the order! :) It's almost packaged and all ready to go. We'll send it out tomorrow once we see you have finalized, you may then contact us any time after that with your order number for your shipping and tracking number. Shipping with express should take 1, 2 days at the absolute maximum and you will receive tracking so you can follow it the whole way. If you've got any other questions feel free to message us back.
     <br/>

     Best regards,

     I didn't choose the Finalize Early option for Express, I paid the extra .4BTC to have regular shipping. Or is this an automated message?

     If you check our shop profile you'll see in our requirements that all orders over $1500 must be finalized before they'll be shipped :/ However if you take a look at our rep and feedback you'll see our shipping is without a doubt the best on SR and you will 100% get your order. This is backed by our 125% return policy at the bottom of our profile. Sorry if this is going to be a hindrance to you and maybe we can try again sometime in the future :) Would you like us to go ahead and cancel your order now?

     Yea, I'm not sure if you're actually even looking at the transaction or just trying to get me to FE.
     <br/>
     My order was under $1,000. Here's the Transaction #[Redacted].
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I even paid an extra $40-$50 to pay for shipping Priority so I wouldn't be asked to FE...
