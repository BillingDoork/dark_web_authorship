    Is it safe to check a tracking number on TOR? Is it safe to check it from the drop location? Is it safe to check it from another house? Is it better to just leave it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does it matter at all?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seems like a minor thing, but worth double checking before checking it.

    do NOT check on TOR. its best to leave it alone and check if you haven't seen the package after a couple weeks
    <br/>
    if you have to check it use the clearnet and dont over do it

    There are possibly inherent issues with all methods of tracking it so i figured it is probably best left unchecked. But curiosity is a bitch so i thought I'd ask. I will just leave it, thanks!

    Use Proxy Services for checking...this way you never show the target service you are using TOR.

    No need to check it unless it's running very late. The post is unpredictable and things take time. Definitely don't check w/ tor, we like going to a public wifi and checking it clearnet with a dedicated computer. All in all just have a little faith, it's in the postal services hands now anyways. Best of luck!

    Why is everyone saying don't check tracking? Do you think checking the tracking several times a day will flag a package? If so, I bet 1/3 of USPS shipments are flagged. of course proxy when checking etc. I feel like a lot of this information you guys are handing out, is just something being repeated, and no one has any true evidence to support it.

    Hey Infinite,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We get where your coming from, but we just don't see the need to check it at all. Checking it won't make it get there faster so why is it even worth the risk. I suppose I could see a few extenuating circumstances where it might be nice, which is why we will provide the number as long as it's encrypted to our customers, but really we don't like to unless they really want it. Just a difference of opinions I guess.

    The more I think about it the less I think people should be checking tracking numbers. As vendors have explained already, and no harm repeating, it should be checked as a last resort. It kind of puts the vendor and buyer in jeopardy otherwise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tracking numbers should be used as a guarantee for buyers who haven't received an order, so that the vendor can reship and is assured that they aren't scammed.
