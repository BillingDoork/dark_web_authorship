    Right i'll be blunt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv loaned a vendor some money, they owe me $500, ment to pay 2 weeks ago but nothing has come through !! not happy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ordered 6 differant things 2 weeks ago, of which 2 are recorded and only 1 has arrived.
    <br/>
    Up until now i have just been patient. But im starting to think it may a personal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do vendors on here work together to fuck people over ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv never had a problem, but as soon as i loaned the money, everything has gone tits up. Im still blaming the Olympics at the moment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do people recon ??? Is anyone getting the same shit as me ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone from the UK experiencing wierd delays ???

    Currently waiting on a package from a vendor I have used reliably before, taking an oddly long time to arrive... UK domestic as well. I'm blaming the Olympics as well, and the fact that it's part time workers at the post office during summer.

    75-80%Â  of the money I have ever lost in this game has ended up in the pockets of those I trusted. Aside from being straight up fucked over ..there are countless circumstances befalling people that result in you not getting paid back.

    Crazy as it is, everything turned out ok. A pleasent e-mail sorted the loan (i got my money back ! ) Im only now waiting for 2 things to show up. I spoke to my post man about letters that should have arrived, he spoke about delays, next day loads of stuff arrived lolo.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still... I needed to have a rant ! All is well now though.
    <br/>
