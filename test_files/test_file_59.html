    Funny how come you were on another thread questioning prices and now you are giving away 2g *samples* for stealth packaging info.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This has all the hallmarks of LE !!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would not be sending any info to this person on enticement of 2 grams of coke.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor account??

    bigpoppa doesn't have a vendors account (he disclosed this to me via pm). I said if he's genuine to take a picture of his coke with his forum id, upload it via the onion image loader, and add it to this thread. If you read his posts, it simply doesn't add up, he posted this on Snow go's thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=69535.msg580460#msg580460 if he's got 'near pure cocaine' why does he want to order from a vendor? Everybody please be cautious until proven otherwise, safety and security are paramount!

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok explain to me why, another person such as myself who lives in canada, finds it ridiculous that he prices his grams at 125 dollars when the going rate here is 60 dollars for premium stuff. I get all my stuff from a local dealer at great rates, and can make a lot more shipping it through silk road, - I have no idea why you think I would be unable to have at a bare minimum 8 grams (LOL) of 80 percent coke with no clue on how to ship?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I seriously came on this site today for the first time and am exploring, I had no idea about vendor accounts and some members are helping me out. I have been selling drugs IRL for a few years now and live comfortably and a friend let me know about this site. I am going to post a picture of my coke in a minute here so why doesnt everyone relax.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, if you want to do more investigating I posted on a thread of another person selling coke saying I was going to order some soon. I said this because I was going to see how he packages it properly. If someone who has some real advice who has received or sent drugs would care to help me VIA PM of the proper way to do this I'd appreciate it. If you want to wait for me to get a vendor account first then I will once it becomes available.

    No worries guys, now if someone has some proper info that I'm looking for I'd really appreciate it, someone who has received or sent stuff already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get the vaacume sealing etc but I am looking for more info regarding: what courier to use out of canada, regular mail or a package? Do I hide it inside something within the package? Or just bubble wrap it? Thanks, so mostly how to package - and safest service to use out of canada.

    For what my opinions worth.....LE or not...You can quite easily get/learn this information without particuarlly asking any one to be honest...I wouldn't say it's 'top secret info' that you can only hear from another person....unless you're more interested in where the information is coming from....in which case... :-\
