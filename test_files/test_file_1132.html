    I have an order that I placed with a vendor (High Carts) and there are 5 days left until auto-finalize. It never arrived in my mailbox yesterday (Saturday). I move today (Sunday). I have set up mail forwarding to my new address, but I just set it up yesterday. There is no way for me to return to the old mailbox within a reasonable timespan. I live in the U.S. and an ordering International.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SO
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What should I expect to happen?
    <br/>
    Will my package most likely be forwarded to the new address and arrive without problems?
    <br/>
    Should I extend the due date in the res center or should I ask for a refund?
    <br/>
    Any other suggestions??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance!Â  :)

    Can you not just leave some self addressed packages and ask the new owner or tenant to forward you any packages or mail that you might get? It's illegal for them to open your mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could be in the same problem shortly. Hopefully the delivery is quick!

    Well I would, but I do believe it will be a while before the next tenant arrives. But thanks for the good wishes!
    <br/>
    Anyone else have thoughts?

    Consider that package burnt. I wouldn't bring any attention to the fact you have packages pending from there. Make a copy of the key and go back if you can. If not it might get RTS. More important why did you buy when you are moving?

    I would recommend opening a dialogue with the vendor and explaining the situation to them. Take it to the resolution center, extend the time by 5 days (this happens automatically when you hit 'resolution', but you may want to extend a few more) and finalise if you are gone and it still hasn't arrived. It's not the vendors fault after all, and they presumably held up their end of the bargain.

    Buy a cheap mailbox and install it on the house, give a close friend the keys and have him collect the post at the specific time the mailman comes (if your post gets delivered at 7.25am have your friend collect it at 7.35).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this isn't possible for some reason then explain to your landlord that you need him to forward mail to a new address.

    Cool, thanks for all the helpful replies, everyone!

    I'll wait to hear back from the vendor and then proceed :)
