    <br/>
    PHACKING is the art of Postal Hacking; or manipulating the mail system in a
    <br/>
    variety of high and low tech ways; sometimes legal, sometimes illegal;
    <br/>
    sometimes to get free delivery and sometimes to get faster delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Phacking has been around since the first stamps were invented in 1847 and were
    <br/>
    shortly thereafter forged by hand. Since then, Phacking has progressed to a
    <br/>
    very high-tech level thanks to an assiduous but predominantly unheard of band
    <br/>
    of pioneers such as The Postmasters, PhedEx, Zip C0de, PoD, Dr. Sort, Post
    <br/>
    Officer, C-Rate, X-Press, Maleman, NonFunc, and The Courier). Phacking has
    <br/>
    certainly been kept fairly hush-hush. Indeed, most people have never even heard
    <br/>
    of Phacking, and I have certainly never seen any Canadian Phacking information,
    <br/>
    much less met or spoken to a Canadian Phacker. Heck, try to find ANY Phacking
    <br/>
    information on the 'Net and you will likely come up empty-handed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At any rate, having never worked in the postal industry and having never spoken
    <br/>
    to a Phacker, I certainly do not have the knowledge of the postal systems
    <br/>
    inner-workings that would allow me to present any truly advanced Phacking
    <br/>
    techniques. The Phacks included are what I could come up with based on the
    <br/>
    research I have done so far and are all quite primitive. Hopefully, those in
    <br/>
    the know will contribute information for a future version of this file, and
    <br/>
    I will continue to learn more when I have absolutely nothing better to do
    <br/>
    with my time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly, I'm sure you're asking yourself "why bother? snail-mail is so
    <br/>
    obsolete and snail-like". I hear ya', don't ask me why I do the things I do.
    <br/>
    Hackers are just an intellectually migratory life form with a positive
    <br/>
    tropism for computers. I guess it's the journey and not the destination or
    <br/>
    something. So, uh, let's get postal.

    Phucking with the mail is generally a VERY SERIOUS CRIME. Keep this in mind --
    <br/>
    sending a letter for free is easy, but habitually abusing the postal service
    <br/>
    will land you in a heap of trouble. You're far better off playing with the
    <br/>
    tricks to get your mail routed faster and leaving the free-mail scams to those
    <br/>
    who enjoy prison. That being said, I accept absolutely no responsibility or
    <br/>
    liability for your actions or for the applicability, legality, or use of the
    <br/>
    information in this document. Fairly warned be thee, says I. Now phack-off.

    (( 2 ) (( Anatomy of a Delivery )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canada Post Corporation (CPC) delivers approximately 8 billion pieces of mail
    <br/>
    every year. There are numerous places for things to go horribly wrong,
    <br/>
    resulting in slower delivery, or even failed delivery. The following diagram
    <br/>
    shows the highlights of a letters adventure as near as I've been able to
    <br/>
    determine it. I also detail each stage of the journey and point out potential
    <br/>
    postal pitfalls, as well as opportunities for you to improve your letters
    <br/>
    chances for successful and "speedy" delivery. Please note that this analysis
    <br/>
    is not comprehensive and may even contain factual errors, but it is the best
    <br/>
    I've been able to piece together thus far as a CPC outsider.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Letter -----(a)----&gt; Mailbox -----(b)----&gt; Delivery Facility -----(c)---.

    :         .--(f1)--&gt; BCS --.
    <br/>

    <br/>

    <br/>
    :
    <br/>
    :
    <br/>
    Addressee &lt;----(i)---- Carrier &lt;----(h)---'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a) Letter ---&gt; Mailbox
    <br/>
    This is you, taking your letter to the mailbox... DUH! Note the pick-up
    <br/>
    days and times which are usually labeled on the mailbox. Not a lot of
    <br/>
    things can go wrong at this stage and it would take a very special kind
    <br/>
    of retard to screw up the mission at this juncture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    b) Mailbox ---&gt; Delivery Facility
    <br/>
    The letters in the mailbox are picked up on schedule and moved by a CPC
    <br/>
    van to a CPC Delivery Facility.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    c) Delivery Facility ---&gt; Distribution Centre Facility
    <br/>
    A Distribution Centre Facility (DCF) is a major postal facility where mail
    <br/>
    is received, sorted, handled and sent to, or received from, a group of
    <br/>
    dependent postal facilities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    d) Distribution Centre Facility ---&gt; MARK
    <br/>
    At the DCF is where your letter meets the MARK. The MARK facer-canceller
    <br/>
    automatically cancels stamped letter-size mail and arranges letters so
    <br/>
    that they all face the same direction. Using phosphorescent detectors,
    <br/>
    the MARK determines if a letter is stamped by detecting minute traces of
    <br/>
    phosphor in stamps. Unstamped mail is sorted into a separate bin for human
    <br/>
    processing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    e) MARK ---&gt; MLOCR
    <br/>
    From the MARK, your letter travels to the Multi-Line Optical Character
    <br/>
    Reader (MLOCR) machine. This machine reads the complete address on a
    <br/>
    properly addressed mail item and encodes the corresponding fluorescent
    <br/>
    bar code. If you don't want a human messing with your mail and slowing
    <br/>
    things down it is critical that you address your mail in a clear and
    <br/>
    proper manner so that the MLOCR can read the address correctly. If the
    <br/>
    machine can't read it, then a human is given a fraction of a second to
    <br/>
    decipher the Postal Code and key it in. One typo and your letter may end
    <br/>
    up in Kugluktuk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    f1) MLOCR ---&gt; BCS
    <br/>
    The Bar Code Sorter (BCS) machine sorts high volume mail such as bar coded
    <br/>
    Business Reply Mail (BRM).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    f2) MLOCR ---&gt; LSM
    <br/>
    The Letter Sorting Machine (LSM) sorts mail by reading fluorescent bar
    <br/>
    codes printed on letter-sized mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    f3) MLOCR ---&gt; FSM
    <br/>
    Flats Sorting Machine (FSM) – A machine that sorts mail flats (larger than
    <br/>
    letter-size items) by reading addresses and/or the bar codes printed on
    <br/>
    such mail, and encodes mail with the bar code as required. Properly and
    <br/>
    legibly formatting your destination address will ensure your letter gets
    <br/>
    sorted quickly and correctly. Or better yet, barcode it yourself. More on
    <br/>
    that later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    g) BCS / LSM / FSM ---&gt; Destination Facility
    <br/>
    After being sorted at the Distribution Centre Facility, your letter is
    <br/>
    forwarded on to its destination Delivery Facility.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    h) Destination Facility ---&gt; Carrier
    <br/>
    The Letter Carriers retrieve the mail for their route from this delivery
    <br/>
    facility. This is the facility from which the mode of delivery emanates
    <br/>
    (e.g. location of postal box, origination of the rural route or letter
    <br/>
    carrier route) and can include urban postal stations, letter carrier
    <br/>
    depots, and rural postal facilities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i) Carrier ---&gt; Addressee
    <br/>
    Postman Dan carries the letter to the person's mailbox that you addressed
    <br/>
    it to. Postman Dan might shoot his co-workers and get indicted before
    <br/>
    even hitting the street or he might trade his mail for crack cocaine. =/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As you can see, it's a miracle any letters ever get delivered at all, what
    <br/>
    with those humans in there always bungling things up. Read on to learn what
    <br/>
    you can do to get some of those post-office philistines out of the loop.
    <br/>

    <br/>
    (( 3 ) (( Faster Routing )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's face it; humans are slow, fat, lazy, and often not too bright. When you
    <br/>
    want the job done right, machines are faster and sexier. It's just a fact.
    <br/>
    This holds especially true in the world of Canada Post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are some simple (and legal!) things you can do to ensure your letter is
    <br/>
    handled by as few humans as possible. The benefit here is not only faster (and
    <br/>
    sexier) delivery, but also, if you are pulling some of the other tricks in
    <br/>
    this document, it is often to your benefit to have as few postal-workers as
    <br/>
    possible scrutinizin' and molestin' your "handi-work". So, just follow the
    <br/>
    tips and the faster it'll ship...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Properly format your mailing addresses:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    . Type (or print clearly) the address all in uppercase.
    <br/>
    . Format address with a uniform left margin.
    <br/>
    . Use proper Unit identifiers (APT = Apartment, SUITE = Suite, UNIT = Unit).
    <br/>
    Unit number is placed before the civic number (official number assigned to
    <br/>
    an address by the municipality) with a hyphen between, OR after the Street
    <br/>
    Type, using an acceptable Unit identifier (ex. APT 69).
    <br/>
    . Use proper Street Type identifiers (ST = Street, AVE = Avenue, BLVD =
    <br/>
    Boulevard).
    <br/>
    . Use proper Street Directions (E, N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW, W).
    <br/>
    . Post Office Boxes are indicated in the form "PO BOX 111" and followed with
    <br/>
    the Station or Retail Postal Outlet where appropriate (STN = Station, RPO =
    <br/>
    Retail Postal Outlet).
    <br/>
    . Rural Routes should be indicated in the form "RR 2" and followed with the
    <br/>
    Station or Retail Postal Outlet where appropriate.
    <br/>
    . City, Province, and Postal Code should all be on the same line with two
    <br/>
    spaces between Province and Postal Code. Use the appropriate two character
    <br/>
    Province Code (AB, BC, MB, NB, NF, NT, NS, NU, ON, PE, QC, SK, YT).
    <br/>
    . Addresses must be less than 40 characters per line, including spaces.
    <br/>
    . Postal codes should be printed in upper case with the first three
    <br/>
    characters separated from the last three by one space (no hyphens).
    <br/>
    . Do not use punctuation unless it is part of a proper name. Never use the #
    <br/>
    symbol either.
    <br/>
    . Use monospace (non-proportional) fonts such as Courier.
    <br/>
    . All characters must be larger than 2 mm and smaller than 5 mm (10 to 12
    <br/>
    point). Return addresses may use smaller characters and must not be larger
    <br/>
    than the destination address.
    <br/>
    . Space between address lines must be at least 0.5 mm but no more than one
    <br/>
    blank line.
    <br/>
    . Return Addresses are formatted in the same way as the destination address,
    <br/>
    and located in the top-left corner of the envelope, clearly separated from
    <br/>
    the destination address, or on the back of the envelope at the top.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're still confused, check out the "Canadian Addressing Guide" available
    <br/>
    from Canada Post Corporation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok, that was pretty basic stuff and it will certainly help the MLOCR (Multi-
    <br/>
    Line Optical Character Reader) read your address, but to make it completely
    <br/>
    foolproof you'll want to use...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -  BAR CODES  -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bar codes are the miracle of modern science that, among other things, would
    <br/>
    have the checkout lines at the grocery stores moving blazing fast if it
    <br/>
    weren't for the ignorant masses holding things up while they piss around with
    <br/>
    their fooking cash cards and wait to be authorized at 2400 baud by a system
    <br/>
    overloaded with hose-monkeys eager to share their spending habits with Big
    <br/>
    Brother and whoever else might want to buy their info for some nefarious
    <br/>
    purpose. But I digress, Bar Codes in the postal world are a godsend. Bar Codes
    <br/>
    have gotten the mail moving through the postal system faster than lead from a
    <br/>
    disgruntled postal workers .44 caliber sidearm. Ok, maybe not that fast. How
    <br/>
    about faster than a snail on methamphetamine? Awe jeah. That is fast.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canada Post uses a barcode standard known as the "4-State Barcode". The 4-State
    <br/>
    barcode is a height modulated barcode consisting of both alpha and numeric
    <br/>
    character sets. This code may be applied by the customer, or by Canada Post's
    <br/>
    automated sorting equipment. A properly designed and rendered barcode will
    <br/>
    allow the FSM (Flats Sorting Machine) to sort the mail items based on the
    <br/>
    4-State barcode thereby increasing the speed at which your letter will flow
    <br/>
    through the system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was going to give a detailed guide to creating your own 4-state barcodes, but
    <br/>
    it truly bores the hell out of me... maybe some other time. So for now I will
    <br/>
    leave you to refer to the Canada Post 4-State Barcode Handbook (available from
    <br/>
    Canada Post) for design information.

    A non-serif (i.e. Arial) style font is typically used, and the mark is placed
    <br/>
    in the upper right hand corner of the envelope where the postage stamp would
    <br/>
    normally be placed. Even a novice counterfeiter should have no problem
    <br/>
    duplicating this mark with a basic graphics program and a printer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to Canada Post Corporation only these items may be mailed using this
    <br/>
    free service:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    . Books, periodicals, papers, and unsealed letters impressed in Braille or
    <br/>
    similar raised type.
    <br/>
    . Tapes and records sent by a blind person.
    <br/>
    . Plates for printing literature for the blind.
    <br/>
    . Tapes, records, and special writing paper intended solely for the use of
    <br/>
    the blind when mailed by, or addressed to, a recognized institution for
    <br/>
    the blind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course only a callous asshole would abuse this service and risk ruining it
    <br/>
    for those who truly need it.

    Reusing stamps not only makes good economic sense, but good environmental
    <br/>
    sense as well. Save a tree, mail for free! Here are a few methods for reusing
    <br/>
    those stamps which one can occasionally get away with:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A. Someone sent you a letter and the postmark didn't even hit the stamp.
    <br/>
    Well, just cut that stamp out and tape or glue it on the letter you want
    <br/>
    to send.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    B. If the postmark damage to the stamp is not too severe, you can often use
    <br/>
    an eraser to scrub off the postmark.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    C. Tape over your stamp with "magic tape". You know, that transparent tape
    <br/>
    that is easy to peel off. Do a good job of it so it's not too noticeable.
    <br/>
    Your recipient will be able to peel that tape off and reuse the stamp.
    <br/>
    "Hey, sometimes the dang stamp just won't stick by itself."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    D. Canada Post is constantly raising the price of stamps by a penny or two
    <br/>
    in an effort to screw the postage paying consumer. They then declare that
    <br/>
    you must buy 2 cent stamps to use in conjunction with your old stamps that
    <br/>
    don't quite meet the new postal rate. Often people end up buying new
    <br/>
    stamps and the old stamps go to waste. Or, they end up doubling up the
    <br/>
    old stamps they have and grossly exceeding the minimum required postage
    <br/>
    just to ensure the letter gets delivered. Well, I say phuck that and
    <br/>
    phuck Canada Post. Use your old stamps as you normally would. Canada Post
    <br/>
    does not waste their time and money returning a letter that is just a few
    <br/>
    cents short on postage.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    (( 6 ) (( No Postage Necessary )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wouldn't it be nice to just mail stuff without worrying about postage at all?
    <br/>
    Well, some people have that privilege. The "Franking Privilege" is a statutory
    <br/>
    privilege available to the Governor General (http://www.gg.ca/), the secretary
    <br/>
    to the Governor General, Speaker or Clerk of the Senate or the House of Commons,
    <br/>
    the Parliamentary Librarian or Associate, members of the Senate and of the
    <br/>
    House of Commons, and certain privileged others. Franking privilege allows for
    <br/>
    the marking on an item of mail with an official signature, initials, or sign
    <br/>
    (franking) indicating the right of the sender to free mailing privileges. If
    <br/>
    you knew what a "frank" looked like you could probably send mail for free this
    <br/>
    way. I'd never seen a piece of "franked" mail so I decided to write a letter
    <br/>
    to the Governor General (currently Adrienne Clarkson) with some suitable social
    <br/>
    engineering and see if I could get her to write back using her franking
    <br/>
    privileges. As an added bonus there is no postage necessary when writing to
    <br/>
    the Governor General of Canada either so it didn't cost me anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Her Excellency the Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson
    <br/>
    Governor General of Canada
    <br/>
    Rideau Hall
    <br/>
    1 Sussex Drive
    <br/>
    Ottawa, Ontario
    <br/>
    K1A 0A1
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course my social engineering is first-class and in less than a week I had
    <br/>
    received an autographed image of her sexcellency Ms. Clarkson in an envelope
    <br/>
    which had been franked by the secretary to the Governor General. The frank
    <br/>
    mark was stamped in red ink and was basically like this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &lt;illegible signature, looks like "Bebars Wack"&gt;
    <br/>
    04.07.13        Secretary to the Governor General
    <br/>
    Secretaire du Gouverneur General
    <br/>
    Ottawa, Ontario  K1A 0A1
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is interesting to me that the date of mailing is built into the stamp.
    <br/>
    Obviously one of those fancy stamps that has the little dials to set the date,
    <br/>
    but I've never seen one built into a larger stamp like this. Also, the name
    <br/>
    in the frank mark is not the same name or signature as the secretary that
    <br/>
    responded to my letter. Anyway, if you were trying to mail a letter
    <br/>
    fraudulently "franked" with the secretary to the Governor General's "frank
    <br/>
    mark" on it, I would think your chances for success would be very slight
    <br/>
    unless you were to drop the letter in a mailbox outside of Rideau Hall. But
    <br/>
    who knows?

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Surely the oldest scam in the Phackers bag of tricks is to switch the return
    <br/>
    address with the destination address and mail it without postage. CPC will
    <br/>
    have it Returned to Sender (RTS) free of charge. You would think this would
    <br/>
    only work when it is mailed in the same city as the intended recipient,
    <br/>
    however, it has been successfully perpetrated city to city. Yeah, that is
    <br/>
    totally retarded.

    (( 8 ) (( Postage-Paid Abuse )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People freak out about e-mail spam, but I hate physical junk mail much more
    <br/>
    than electronic junk mail. I can simply delete spam, and anyone with two brain
    <br/>
    cells to rub together can figure out how to set up some simple spam filters
    <br/>
    which reject most spam before it hits their inbox. But junk mail? For
    <br/>
    fuck-sakes! They cram it in your mailboxes, under your doors, and leave piles
    <br/>
    of it in the lobby of your building. It all ends up in landfills and is a major
    <br/>
    waste of paper. Just try and make them stop forcing that shit on you. Forget
    <br/>
    it! I've gotten into fist-fights with the fuckers delivering that crap because
    <br/>
    they felt they had the right to cram it in my mailbox in spite of my "no junk
    <br/>
    mail" signs and my direct requests to them to stop it. They bring garbage to
    <br/>
    your house and you're forced to pick it up and dispose of it! And this is
    <br/>
    legal!?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We see governments scrambling to legislate against spam, but not junk mail. At
    <br/>
    least spam is non-polluting. So why the double-standard? Could it be that our
    <br/>
    slave-masters simply hate spam because:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a) it's so easy for clever computer people to become exceptionally wealthy
    <br/>
    by doing it and our slave-masters abhor "newbies" getting rich and
    <br/>
    interfering with the status quo of the old-boys network
    <br/>
    <br/>
    b) it reduces their efficiency in spying on real e-mails
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I strongly suspect both reasons are true.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what to do? Exact some revenge and vent your frustration via Postage-Paid
    <br/>
    mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Postage-Paid mail (aka Business Reply Mail (BRM)) is made available to junk
    <br/>
    mail spammers through an agreement with Canada Post. Business Reply Mail is
    <br/>
    used by businesses, publishers, government departments, fund raisers and other
    <br/>
    organizations to allow the recipient to respond on the sender's dime. It is
    <br/>
    available in two pre-addressed and postage-paid formats: envelope and card.
    <br/>
    Customers only pay for the items that are returned to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You've all seen them but probably never used them. The tend to look something

    (1) Business Reply Mail Indicia – The Business Reply Mail indicia is the
    <br/>
    "postage stamp". It contains the Customer Number and Customer Sortation
    <br/>
    Code.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (2) Three Extraction Bars – The three vertical bars to the left of the
    <br/>
    indicia prompt the mail processing equipment to extract Business Reply
    <br/>
    Mail items for special handling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (3) Chevrons – The chevrons below the indicia are the Business Reply Mail
    <br/>
    service identifier. These chevrons are not to be used on any other
    <br/>
    Canada Post service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (4) Business Reply Mail Bar Code and Human-Readable Line – The bar code and
    <br/>
    the human-readable line directly above it contain the information
    <br/>
    necessary for invoicing and delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (5) Business Reply Mail Address – This area is for the spammer's company
    <br/>
    name and the Business Reply Mail address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (6) Business Reply Mail Postal Code – The Business Reply Mail postal code may
    <br/>
    differ from the spammer's regular postal code. NOTE: For spammers who
    <br/>
    have a rural address (postal code with a zero as the second character),
    <br/>
    the postal code will remain the same.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So when you see these -- mail them. Every one you drop back into a mailbox
    <br/>
    costs the junk mail spammer money. When I get ones on envelopes I like to take
    <br/>
    the other junk mail I received that day and stuff it in the envelope and mail
    <br/>
    them the other spammer's garbage. I'll often collect all the other BRM
    <br/>
    envelopes other people discard and stuff those full of junk mail too. It's very
    <br/>
    therapeutic. You often get these kinds of things from credit card companies.
    <br/>
    Those are my favorite as credit card companies are nothing more than cock-
    <br/>
    sucking shit-eaters. (Note: I've NEVER had a credit card in my life and I NEVER
    <br/>
    will.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The truly devious could photocopy the Business Reply Mail a few hundred or
    <br/>
    thousand times and dump them into several mailboxes around town. Ho ho ho
    <br/>
    that's gotta hurt!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or if you're really adventurous you could scan a piece of Business Reply Mail
    <br/>
    into your computer, doctor the return address to wherever you want it to go
    <br/>
    instead, and try using it to send whatever you want for free. I don't know if
    <br/>
    it would get there, but it would be fun to try. Of course the recipient might
    <br/>
    have some explaining to do if Canada Post catches on. But who says you have
    <br/>
    to mail it to someone you like?
