    I have to use a PO box, as my apartment situation isn’t properly equipped to received packages. And I don’t want to have things sent to home anyway. Been using the same PO box for over a year and about 30 shipments, all just weed, one at a time, small amounts (4-8 grams). Batting a thousand, until now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just purchased some THC capsules and this package didn’t come through. I haven’t received anything at all in the way of a warning, etc. Should I stop operating from this address and use a different one?
    <br/>
    But then I also have another concern. If I just drive to the next PO in town and open a new box there, and if I am under some kind of scrutiny, will any other boxes I open be under watch also? In other words, since the PO is all one big system, when I go to the new location to open a box and give them my name, will their system show I’m flagged as being under watch or something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Guess I’m just looking for recommendations if anyone’s been down this road before. I realize the smartest thing to do is to not continue breaking the law. But I need my weed dammit. This is the only law I break (a stupid law), and this is only way I can acquire weed. So I’m getting ancy and about to just say fuck it, and order again, but I don’t want to let my impulses lead me into a stupid mistake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would’ve thought of all things that could be intercepted, that pills would be the least suspicious. I mean, wouldn’t they have to spend a bunch of money to send them to a lab or something to be analyzed before they could deem them illegal and confiscate them? What if I was just ordered vitamins in the mail? It doesn’t make sense that they would see pills and instantly think “illegal drugs” and destroy them. But then again, I did read other customer comments saying once the vacuum seal was cut open the capsules do have a strong weed smell. I suppose if by chance the Man did open it, the smell would be a big giveaway. But does the PO normally freak out when detecting pills?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This was my first transaction with this seller, but he has a 100% rep and I don’t suspect foul play there. I’m trying to get tracking info from him so I can see if it says it at least made it to the PO. That would give me a better idea if it came under scrutiny. But he’s gone stealth and apparently stepped away from SR for now and not answering.

    I'm also curious about this too..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I figure if they wanted you by now, they would've nabbed you already man.
    <br/>
    Just get in contact with the vendor to see what's going on.
    <br/>
    And I also wouldn't order anything else illegal to that drop until you get to the bottom of this.

    I got the instant feeling that you were simply burned on the deal, or something happened with the vendor. Car accident, arrested, whatever. Or closed shop and those last few orders just ain't gettin their shit. Seen it many times. When vendors stop selling, it almost always ends with a few 'burns'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope I'm wrong, but keep a look out on forums, search the vendor name each day, and see if anyone else is missing their order. Obviously watch his FB if the account is still up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try another order or even test mail something, or have a friend send you some tylenol and see if it gets to the box unharmed. Something tells me it will.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going with my gut. The vendor took the last exit off of Silk Rd.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I doubt they'd be 'watching' you. Especially with personal use amounts. I mean people do get busted for weed in the mail, just ordering from the legal shops in San Fran, not even Silk Roaders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they had something on you, you would have been visited by LE already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my feeling on this one. I don't think I know everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thought you could use my opinion. I'm sure others could come up with another scenario.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am sure that opening another PO Box in another town, will match you right up, of course, they use computers, and you have to show a license to open one. I don't think that's suspicious behavior.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe you just want one that's on your way home from work etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would wait a good week, and keep an eye out on here, for similar stories.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything could turn out to be fine, and it just got 'lost' - or some USPS worker is getting high on it right now, maybe the vendor will come back out of hiding and explain everything?
    <br/>
    I'm getting too many 'maybes' in my head now! LoL - sorry, I'm just trying to be helpful.

    Is the vendor you're referring to knicknack by any chance? I ordered some capsules from him and haven't received my order or any sort of love letter. I tried messaging him about it a couple days ago and haven't gotten a response. I figured by the time I heard anything back from him  my order would've ended up auto-finalizing, so I went ahead and just submitted a resolution.

    It's really not hard to figure out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Order something really small, like 1g or whatever they wont really pursue you for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If its being watched/flagged, then it will be removed/seized.

    If it arrives then it should be fine.

    I dont know if it's bad to name names here, but I guess this reveals nothing about his identity or methodologies, so: yes, that was the seller. This is very relieving to hear from you. I mean, yeah we didn't get our purchases, but it also pretty much gives us an answer about where the problem lies and relieves a lot of my paranoia. This was a good example of community help being effective in piecing this together. Thanks!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, on to an awkward decision. What kind of feedback to give him? Call me an optimist, but I really dont think his goal here was to screw people. His review thread has way too many satisfied customers, who also point out his impeccable customer service. I hate to be the one to tarnish his 100% rating. But at the same time, is it fair for me to release my funds, knowing I'm not getting what I paid for?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For that matter, what will happen if I dispute? If' he's not around to answer, what happens to the dispute (and the money) normally in that case?

    I still would give it some time. I don't know how long your pack has been missing, but at least wait for a response from the vendor before you leave bad feedback because it could just be a minor mishap. Just be honest with your feedback if you choose to post it.

    Sly has a point- how long? - Then again, you got another one, not getting theirs. - And naming names is fine. - If it's a legit problem, which it is. Then that's what forums are for. - If the vendor hasn't hopped on the scam train, then they have every opportunity to make it right, and show that it was a misunderstanding.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Something tells me, it's what it looks like, as you have the other complaint now. (is that the right spelling because Knicknack search yields no match) - If the listings are still up, and it's getting close to auto-finalaize,  ( that's a pretty long time for domestic)  I would submit a resolution. If they're not answering posts, and it's been over 10 days from "marked in transit", the vendor really doesn't have a leg to stand on, unless they make a surprise appearance!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can't leave feedback until it's resolved, so no worry.  I would go to resolution. If they see you, and Red Rama both with the same complaint, I'm sure there will be others. SR Admins more likely to refund you money (ask for 100% obviously).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it gets resolved by SR, and the Vendor still hasn't made an appearance or contact. That's a 1 out of 5 in my book! ( you can edit FB as often as you like btw). If two weeks from now, the vendor comes back on, and says "You'll never believe what I've been through" - or something to that effect, and want's to 'make it right' , then you can go right ahead and change it to a 5/5, and everyone wins!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How soon till AF, and was this domestic -US to US?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if the account is still up under a different spelling than the one given, you can see the last time they were seen logged in to their account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do update us. It will be interesting to see how this one works.

    I gave it a week after it was marked as shipped before contacting. He was in stealth with no listings. It wont show his last seen time (is this a feature of stealth I didnt realize? Is that also why he's unsearchable?) No reply back for another week now, and today is the final day before AF. I wasnt even looking for a refund if it got lost/nabbed. I understand those things happen and not a vendors fault. But with RedRama's info, it seems likely it never even made it out.

    Nope, the account is indeed spelled "knicknack". What's weird about his page is it just says how long he's been a vendor and his feedback %. I've visited other vendor pages before when they were in stealth mode, and they always list how long it's been since the vendor was last online. I'm glad you made this post club. I originally submitted a resolution for a 75% refund, to split some of the loss with the vendor, but it seems more likely at this point there's no loss to split.

    IMHO, your package never made it out and you got burned by the vendor. From another angle, I have heard from different sources that depending on the substance and or quantity, they purposely don't send out LLs so that you don't have one to send the vendor a copy for a refund or reship. I also heard that is more common with steroids.

    Well unless you can give me a link. When I search knicknack on regular Silk Road, I get no results.

    BKisnotBurgerKing kind of reiterated my original point. - You were burned. - Get whatever you can out of SR Resolution, and move on.

    It's assholes like that, who make the cost of doing business, that much more costly.

    <br/>
    See? - It's just like real life!

    <br/>
    All the hamstrings and roadblocks of doing business in the US, (aka regulation) is alive and well, even on the Silk Road.

    <br/>
    That's the problem with alternate 'systems' of government, or economics. - They all sound great in theory. - Yet we rarely factor in the "Man has it's limitations"

    No matter what your ideology, you must first accept the failings of man (humankind), but also, never underestimate the goodness of those who walk amongst us!

    It's an amazing paradox. If you live long enough, and I mean really live! You'll see what I mean.

    Just figured I'd update and give this thread a bump. Still heard nothing from the vendor, but I got a 100% refund out of the resolution and my buyer stats remain unaffected. Aside from the inconvenience of having some coins tied up in escrow I'm no worse for wear though. It's unfortunate after 30 successful transactions I finally ordered from a total jackass, but that's just part of buying on the road.
