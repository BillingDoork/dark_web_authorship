    I have to use a P.O box because I travel out of state mon-thursay every week. I asked my hotel if I could ship things here and he said that it might be hard if it doesnt get delivered when Im staying there. He mentioned to call when its expected to arrive and let the front desk know. I do not want to take that chance of it getting sent back.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS P.O box, I have to live in the state where I want to open a box up. I guess I could go back to my homestate on friday and open one up but that means I have to make the long drive over state lines with my gear. I really dont mind but its more risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPS P.O box, uses a physical address no PObox address. All UPS stores are independently owned and operated. I know people advise against UPS in any step of the delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is the smallest box size good enough?(3"x5")  I'm only interested in a ball of coke here and there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are my other options?
    <br/>
    Anyone use, "The UPS store"?

    UPS/FedEx are frowned upon because 4th Amendment doesn't apply to them when they are the shipper, so they can search any package for any reason.  However, I think it's a completely different story if their only role is to be the PO box.  Maybe check out the UPS store (or other PO box service store) terms of service and see what it says about opening packages.  Maybe a better idea is to get a PO box from an independently operated store.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping via US mail to a UPS store box is probably pretty safe because it is a federal crime to open someone's mail.  If you ship via UPS/FedEx to a UPS store, they can open any package they want to for any BS reason they can come up with.  No one working at a PO box store is going to open someone's US mail, that's a serious crime.  The most they would do is call the cops if your PO box seems to be making the entire building reek of weed. :P
