    hi all, ive been waiting on an order off a very reputable vendor  for 4 days now...UK to UK delivery.this usually arrives next day.its now been 3 business days plus saturday and theres still no sign of the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is anyone else in the uk experiencing domestic delays?.. my mate ordered domestically on thursday and recieved it today, so that makes me think the problem aint down to delays
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i simply cant understand why its taking so long,ive ordered off this vendor many times and his packaging is about as good as it gets, has anyone waited longer than 4 days for a UK domestic shipment? - more specifically - do i have any hope of the package still comming as mentally im starting to give up hope,that way avoiding anymore dissapointment!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any help is much appreciated

    I'm also experiencing this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've got orders due from MrFireUK and BlackTunaGang - two of the most reputable UK vendors. I ordered last wednesday (15th) and I'm still waiting now. I had post arrive on thursday, saturday and today (monday) but my orders weren't there. However, an order I placed with TheChemistShop back on Tuesday arrived the next day with no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    WTF is going on? Is someone at Royal Mail stealing our orders or are they being seized without informing us? I'm REALLY hoping there's just some kind of postal delay going on, but the longer I wait, the longer I feel as though I'm never going to see my orders arrive.

    well m8, i got fuck all but pointless leaflets off my postie today.gutted doesnt cover it! as far as i can see, the order is gone.whether it was stolen by a postie or snared by the feds thers no way a 1st class letter takes this long.this is the 1st time this has happened to me and its mega frustrating waiting every day and nothing arriving, i keep thinking of reasons why it may still turn up but its time to be realistic and accept aint comming

    It's probably overloaded at the moment by UCAS results, every 16-18 year-old student in England gets a letter ;) give it until Wednesday and it should be okay.

    Remember as well that royal mail is still catching up on backlogs caused by the olympics - and as said above, the posting of exam results to thousands of  people ( my mate at RM says that these letters take priority when moved into sorting offices )
    <br/>
    Im still waiting on a next day posted on the 6th! ( im sure it will turn up one day lol )
    <br/>
    If it averts any paranoia ive had a good few packs come through since o I dont think theres any conspiracy of stolen letters - though I have cursed the postman in a hundred different ways on a daily basis since.
    <br/>
    You just gota keep the faith guys - 99.9% of uk stuff will turn up at some point.
    <br/>
    Back in the day when I used Budmail i waited 29 days once for a letter to turn up - its not easy when your stuck waiting but try not to let
    <br/>
    postman stalking take over your life!
    <br/>
    Peace.

    Bloody students! All this university malarkey seems awfully selfish when there are fine upstanding individuals like us being condemned to sobriety! ;D

    Don't Royal Mail know some of us are desperate drug-dependent loafers? ???

    raistlin - i admire your positive outlook! i will try and adopt such a positive attitude. yeah it certainly aint good to let postman stalking take over your life but its very hard not to at times, especially when his arrival or non arrival at your door is the key to recieving the goods. If im honest i think that hope should be maintained for 5 business days, beyond that i feel that somethings gone wrong somewhere, either with the packaging or within the postal system.i used to have a mate that was a postie and he could get his hands on anything you wanted...phones,football shirts and all sorts...the source of these goods? - a guy at the depot who steals it out the postal system! ive even heard of a postie that got sacked as he couldnt be fucked delivering items and took them home instead! lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    considering royal mail handle 73 million items a day i would imagine that a small percentage go missing every day, that could mean delivered to the wrong address or simply not delivered at all. im hopefull that my order shows up, but i certainly wouldnt bet on it arriving
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks for the replies, dont like to see others feel the pain of missing/delayed orders but its always good to compare notes to put our minds at rest and maintain some hope!!

    Had a few things show up today. If these were any other packages I'd be demanding royal mail refund the postage, 4/5 working days for 1st class! Anyway, keep the faith UK people, our posties may be moving in slow motion but things do arrive eventually.
