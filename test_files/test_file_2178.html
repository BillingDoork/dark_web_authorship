    Fucking hell dude. You need to bang a few hookers or something, and start working on your speech impediment. Gareth Gates did it, and he was borderline retarded. Who knows, in a decade or so you may actually have grown some pubes and be able to buy something from a shop! Progress can be steep. It's going to be very hard though son, very hard indeed. But you never know, you might even be able to walk on the pavement, with your feet!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The sky is the limit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well not really, because you would never be able to work out the logistics necessary to get to an airport/buy a ticket/conduct yourself like a real person.
