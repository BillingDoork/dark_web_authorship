    I've read to always order domestic, but tbh the 2 vendors I am considering are
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.)Dutchtrade
    <br/>
    2.)Supertrips
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering what experience other people may have had when ordering from Germany to USA?

    There is a popular(and successful) vendor from the Baltics that has been around private forums for many years.  He does(or did)a great deal of business with USA buyers.  The kicker is his pkgs are usually shipped from Germany.  I've never heard of any seizures.

    Dutchtrade is awesome, we spoke on their review thread i think OP, im waiting on my order ATM . and A little worry is always healthy i suppose, even domestic LSD should keep you on your toes, but DT is an established vendor and they do good. Im only 1/1 but my second order shouldnt be any different, just be prepared to wait for over a week.

    DT says they are from Germany, despite their name 'Dutch' haha.

    I've personally successfully received 2 packs from Germany just over a month ago or so.  One was 10 tabs of LSD and the other was 5g MDMA.  Both had no problems at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Looking to get 50 tabs and 10g sometime soon.  Germany &gt; USA is just as safe as UK &gt; US more or less.

    Ironically DutchTrade does NOT ship from Netherlands/Holland like the name would imply. Their stealth is pretty good and they are really consistent especially to USA. They are rumored to begin using MBBs soon though, having some supply issues at the moment, according to the profile. Damn near one of the best batches of MDMA I've ever had, hooked it up 10% bonus too!

    That's a good thing to hear. Yeah I just read a post from the DutchTradeCrew back in April that said they're using MBBs now.

    For people in the US that want to order cheap MDMA international but want safety I recommend FEUK.  I just bought the last of his 50g listings but he'll have more very soon and the price is pretty darn good just over $1k.  He crushes his MDMA for shipment but for me safety is more important than having larger chunks of MDMA.  He also ships as 2 25g packages for safety and uses MBBs.  Shipments from the UK have been taking as little as 4-5 days.  His communication is excellent.  No language barrier and he often responded to my PMs within minutes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do go with FEUK then please let him know I referred you.  :)

    Registered mail, at least in the US, does NOT mean it has to be signed for. When something is sent registered that simplyh means that the post office keeps a record of the item. If you requested a certificate of delivery with registered mail, then a signature is required.

    I have had dozens of packages come from Germany and never had any issue whatsoever.

    Registered mail in the US does require a signature (thus completing the chain of custody), but not all mailmen follow the rules.
