    If you have posted mail to/in Australia, chances are that it has passed through one or several of the machines featured in this video. I found the link while looking through the vendor profile of Best Dutch Drugs, so some credit to them for finding the video. It appears to be either made by or for teenagers for some sort of 'competition' entry, nonetheless it is extremely detailed and provides an excellent look into how AusPost sorts and sends its mail. The video is about 35MB and runs for just over 7 mins.

    Obviously there would be certain things they were not allowed to film/air for security reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They have hand-held particle 'sniffers' that can detect certain chemicals, explosives, some class a drugs and I know they have plenty of drug dogs that go round the countryside randomly doing checks at different mail centers, more-so with customs checks. Customs has huge mobile Xrays that scan entire cargo shipping containers on the backs of semi trailers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You never know when governments are going to come out with some new technology though, and Australian is the perfect testing ground, plenty of mail to check and plenty of taxpayers to foot the bill.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is Australia Customs 2012 Annual Report on Illicit drugs and precursors (html version) - very detailed information here ;)
    <br/>
    http://www.customs.gov.au/aboutus/annualreports/2012/part03/1_1_illicit_drugs_and_precursors.html
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br/>
    The following is copied from this link - http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/fs_advancingtechnology040819.pdf
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Customs is a world leader in the use of technology for border
    <br/>
    protection activities and uses new technologies to counter threats
    <br/>
    to Australia’s border security.
    <br/>
    The use of technology, when combined with advanced cargo and
    <br/>
    passenger screening procedures, gives Customs an advantage
    <br/>
    over those seeking to circumvent border controls.
    <br/>
    Customs border protection technologies can detect and
    <br/>
    identify a wide range of threats from weapons and narcotics, to
    <br/>
    explosives, chemical and radioactive substances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    COMPUTER FORENSICS
    <br/>
    To deal with the growing use of electronic media, Customs has
    <br/>
    created a national computer forensics capability to acquire,
    <br/>
    analyse and reconstruct evidence in a manner admissible in a
    <br/>
    court of law.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TRACE PARTICLE DETECTION OF
    <br/>
    NARCOTICS AND EXPLOSIVES
    <br/>
    Trace particle detection technology allows Customs officers to
    <br/>
    find the slightest trace (measured in nanograms, or billionths of
    <br/>
    a gram) of a target substance on passenger baggage, mail and
    <br/>
    cargo items.
    <br/>
    Customs uses trace particle detection technology to detect
    <br/>
    traces of narcotics and explosives.
    <br/>
    Positive results provide presumptive indications that the article
    <br/>
    being examined may contain or has been in contact with a target
    <br/>
    substance.
    <br/>
    Customs uses a number of different trace particle detection
    <br/>
    machines.  These are used in a number of environments
    <br/>
    including airports, seaports, cargo and postal facilities around
    <br/>
    Australia. The machines are used in conjunction with other
    <br/>
    Customs technologies including x-ray and detector dogs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BULK SUBSTANCE DETECTION OF ILLICIT
    <br/>
    SUBSTANCES
    <br/>
    Customs uses substance identification technology when a
    <br/>
    suspect visible (bulk) amount of a substance has been located
    <br/>
    in either passenger baggage or cargo.  Bulk substances can
    <br/>
    include pills, powders, tablets, pastes and liquids.
    <br/>
    Each of these forms of substances requires their own particular
    <br/>
    sampling and handling method.
    <br/>
    Bulk substance identifier technologies are deployed at a
    <br/>
    range of airports, seaports, cargo and postal facilities across
    <br/>
    Australia. A small amount of the substance (up to the size of
    <br/>
    a grain of rice) is analysed either by a laser or by the colour
    <br/>
    reaction of various reagent chemicals.
    <br/>
    A positive response provides a presumptive indication of an
    <br/>
    illicit substance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    X-RAY TECHNOLOGIES
    <br/>
    Customs uses x-ray technology to examine passenger luggage,
    <br/>
    postal articles, and air and sea cargo containers.
    <br/>
    Depending on the cargo type to be screened, Customs can
    <br/>
    employ any combination of its container, cabinet, pallet, mobile
    <br/>
    van or trailer-mounted systems to provide an unobtrusive
    <br/>
    examination to high volumes of cargo.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION
    <br/>
    MONITORING
    <br/>
    Customs national closed circuit television (CCTV) network
    <br/>
    combines modern video and communication technology to
    <br/>
    provide efficient and effective coverage of waterfront and airport
    <br/>
    activities around Australia, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year.
    <br/>
    The waterfront network of CCTV cameras is monitored at offices
    <br/>
    throughout Australia and remotely at regional monitoring centres.
    <br/>
    The National Monitoring Centre in Melbourne also monitors the
    <br/>
    Customs CCTV system.
    <br/>
    Customs also operates a CCTV network at Australia’s eight
    <br/>
    international airports.
    <br/>
    The CCTV cameras are controlled and monitored locally via
    <br/>
    control rooms and are supported through the Airports National
    <br/>
    Monitoring &amp; Analysis Centre located in Melbourne.

    That original video was found on the first post of this thread - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0

    <br/>
    Keep an eye on post 1 because it gets updated from time to time when more information is made available :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the particle scanners... nothing to worry about there as they're simply those hand-held swabbers you see at the airport that they rub over the outside of body/luggage etc to detect explosive traces.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From a mail point of view, the only time these are used is when the letter fails the first stage examination, which is either a visual examination by a human or an alert from a drug dog. Second stage examination is either particle swabbing or x-ray. If it fails this, it's going to be opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So USE Moisture Barrier Bags!! and make sure you package in a clean environment. And follow all the other information on that post I linked, it comes from very good sources!

    I don't think they are relevant videos anymore, as the times have changed so much. The technology behind mail sorting I would think has changed so much due to the advent of the internet, online orders, terrorism etc and advancement of computer technology.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think you should be fine ordering a prescription drug (tho for peace of mind good packaging is a must) as I doubt their sniffers would be setup to detect an otherwise legal (with prescription) drug (chemical). Like say benzos and opiates (excluding heroin).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As you can order them legally online from an online pharmacy so long as you can provide them with a script. So a lot of people who rely on online pharmacies (disabled say) would find their drugs confiscated if these sniffers worked on those kinds of drugs I would think.

    The main reason we bring up the sniffers here at SR forum is because the Vendors here are packaging drugs clandestinely, unlike pharma companies who have vacuum purged machine rooms that are nearly 100% free of any contaminents, including any active ingredients.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors here must combat that clandestination (no pun intended clandestination ;) ) by using alcohol etc. to wipe down any deliveries they make, even a particle that weighs nanograms can be detected by these particle sniffers. The pharma companies are not going to have particles of active drugs on the outside of their deliveries due to their extremely clean manufacturing environments, although if they did (morphine for example) it would be as easily recognized as heroin is, as it's still an opiate - the sniffers will not distinguish morphine from heroin, or methamphetamine from MDMA - they will both be classed as opiates and amphetamines respectively.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can't comment on whether or not sniffers can detect Benzos. Just ring Customs and ask them... let us know what they say :)

    That machines exist that can detect nanograms of drugs is irrelevant. It's like saying you can take photos from your satellites with resolution capable of counting ants and then positing that this will stop all auto theft.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In practice the detection thresholds and circumstances can be circumvented by the use of swarming technologies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    International vendors are like credit card companies encountering card fraud. They expect to "lose a few". The majority of what the Australian postal police and AFP have to say about drugs in the mail is posturing.
