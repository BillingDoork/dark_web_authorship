    thinking about reselling the foil top that goes on top of a vitamin bottle when you open it
    <br/>
    <br/>
    are there any vitamins that could avoid detection? as in spread a bunch of powder in a vitamin bottle with around say
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IE: 50 vitamin C capsules, and 20 other caps filled with drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is there a surefire way to get it through safely?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is airports people
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks =)

    nothing is sure fire when you are dealing with illegal things.

    <br/>
    you would have to do really carefully as to not leave any residue on the outside or on the lid, as a test picks up traces then they will open an inspect.

    Seems like a pretty bad/risky idea if you ask me, as others have said it would be virtually impossible to avoid residue from being transferred to the bottle and thus easily detectible. In my country internal domestic flights often have much less in the way of screening and I'm yet to see a drug dog at a domestic airport but that's certainly no guarantee there might not be one day. If you are thinking about doing this on an international flight you need your head testing, way too risky IMHO.
