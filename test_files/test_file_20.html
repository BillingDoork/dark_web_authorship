    so my last order came but it was ripped opened then pressed back together so just empty bubble mailer is all i received so my thing is why would they just send an empty envelope with nothing in it why not throw the envelope away too unless a postal worker took it for personal use not my mailman though(dude is like 60+) this was a domestic order too i had shit come from canada in bubble mailer with no return address go through customs single vac sealed and it made it so what the fuck this past order(domestic US to US) was for a 1/2 oz of bud from north caliÂ  last one from this guy made it no problems so any thoughts would be appreciated as to address flagged or stoner postal worker b/c vendor has offered to re-ship i'm on east coast and have no alternative addresses to use
