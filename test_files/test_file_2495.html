    So I have been waiting for a large order from a very credible vendor (also is know for great stealth) for some time. I went to check tracking, after not receiving the package for some time, and it had an update stating that there was an attempted delivery to the address some days ago. The strange thing was that no notice was actually left, however the status update online said that I could schedule a redelivery or pick it up at the PO. I know that this is normal and should be safe, but should I be worried that there was no actual notice ever left at the address or is this common? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! :)

    It just means unfortunately you got a lazy and unprofessional driver who was too lazy to walk up to your door/apartment and left it at the post office because he can. I'd suggest to complain, but why bring attention to yourself.
