    Hello, you beautiful bastards!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm a fresh swedish newbie, and before I place my first order I'll obviously want to be fairly comfortable in doing so. The digital part I've read up on, and do evrything by the book, so there I'm confident evrything will be fine (and if it's not, it'll at least not be my fault), same with who I order from, etc etc. My question is much, much much more trivial (I think, anyway). I would prefer to have the package delivered not to my door, but to my local post office to be collected there. This is due to my living with my parents, and my extreme aversion to them finding an odd letter/parcel, possibly with a weird smell, from abroad, or have a DHL van turning up asking for me. So, is this advisable, and (most painfully simply) what would the terminology be in my communication with the vendor? I mean, do I just ask him/her to deliver it to be collected at the post office, or what do I actually say? I'll be ordering weed, or possibly hash, in small amounts, from europe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace!
    <br/>

    *Edit; after looking into this more, it seems like what I had in mind didn't quite exist in the way that I thought. Silly me. What I meant for seems to be registered mail, which is parhaps not quite ideal, considering all the signing involved. Parhaps it would be better to simply get it via regular mail and keep a sharp lookout until it arrives.

    Seems like you have answered your own question by discovering it wasn't possible kind of making this thread irrelevant  ::)
