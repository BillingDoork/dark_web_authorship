    So I ordered something small (7 grams) exactly a week ago (Tuesday night last week) and it was shipped domestically the same night. I know it's supposed to take 3 or 4 business days for national shipments, and since today would be the 4th not counting the day it was actually picked up and processed, I was wondering..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's the amount of days before you give up? Since it has JUST been 4 business days I'm not too worried yet, but if it's not here tomorrow I might be concerned. Would I be over reacting a little bit? Does anyone else have experience receiving domestic orders in Canada where it's taken longer than 4 business days, plus the day it shipped?

    Depends how far its going. For example from Prince Edward Island to Vancouver is going to take a lot longer then a shipment that originates in the same city.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a Domestic Order traveling across several provinces take 8 days. Best thing to do if you want it soon is order Xpresspost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is a domestic shipment there should be tracking unless it was sent lettermail. Contact vendor for more info.

    Unfortunately it was sent in a letter so that it was inconspicuous. It's not so much that I want it soon, I just want to know that I WILL get it eventually. The fact that you had one take 8 days and still show up makes me feel more at ease, though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No idea where it was shipped from in the country, but if it's not here by Friday I'll shoot the vendor a message.

    Very strong union that prevents getting rid of lazy workers. It's all about seniority, not if you can actually do the job. I know everyone at the local post office and see some astonishing stupidity. When I used to run an online legit business, I was in there every day, and some of the screwups and foolishness I observed makes me pretty confident that they are definitely not looking for contraband, as they can barely deliver the mail.

    My longest delivery time was 8 business days for domestic. Canada post has many issues currently, including extending the routes of mail carriers but somehow expecting them to be done in the same amount of time. I wouldn't really worry until a solid two weeks has passed.

    Alright, well if it's not here by Wednesday next week I guess I'll start discussing a resolution with the vendor. That gives it 11 business days of in transit to get to me.Â  Although I've already started to give up hope. I'll be surprised if it does show up next week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, the vendor seems perfectly willing to work with me so no problem there. It's too bad though because I wanted them for July long. Ah well.

    And they showed up today. That's 9 full business days, I never thought a domestic order would take that long, I was certain it was a lost cause. But they showed.

    May any concerned Canadian who stumbles upon this topic be reassured that sometimes, it just takes a while.

    Another vouch for the excruciatingly slow. I've gotten shipments from the UK and EU in 4-5 business days, from sweet home Canada in over 10. But it's the culture here, especially when you leave the big cities- slow and steady wins the race.

    If you ever get the option spring for the Xpress post. It will cost a few more dollars but comes with full tracking,padded envelopes and priority service. 2-4 days max.

    It's a trade-off; you get your package more closely handled, amongst fewer other packages, and you'll likely have to sign for it. But sometimes you need your drugs flown in an airplane.

    I don't think this vendor offers xpress, but if I have the opportunity in the future I'll definitely take it. Your package may be closely handled, but waiting those 2 weeks for this was way more stressful than it needed to be. Every day I dreaded being at work because I just wanted to get home and check my mailbox. When it was empty, it was frustrating. On a daily basis.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, if a package were to not show up at all, I wouldn't be able to stand the fact that there was a package of drugs with my NAME and ADDRESS on it just floating out there somewhere, and eventually opened. I mean, it's not like the return address is going to be legitimate, so if they can't find your place, it's not going back to the vendor.

    Canada Post can be bad and it can take a while--from certain cities that actually aren't too far away from me, it can take two weeks.Â  At the same time, I'm not going to complain, because any of the postal workers I've ran into have a motto along the lines of not caring what's in the package (that's not their job...), but simply getting it to its location, even if it smells.Â  I'll wait two weeks for that.
