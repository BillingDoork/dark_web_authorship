    I placed an order  Thursday and used the express option, I wasn't really expecting it until Tuesday because it can sometimes take 24 hours for the item to be shipped and with this vendor it always takes 2 days not one with express to get to me. Just because of the distance.  To my surprise i must have got the order in early enough on Thursday that he actually got it shipped that day, so i asked what day to expect it and he told me the DCN said a Oct, 6th guarantee by 3:00pm. Well, its now 8:00pm and nothing. Is it possible the date was changed? he did track it and gave me the ETA about a hour after it shipped so maybe USPS just estimated wrong? I don't use express much maybe 3 times, so i dont really know what to expect.Is it possible for it to take 3 days or is it most likely lost?

    I think you will be alright.  You will most likely get it on Tuesday since Monday is holiday.

    Thanks man, i have kinda came to same conclusion, as long as the vendor doesn't tell me it says something weird when he tracks it.

    I agree with painbow.  It will probably show up on Tuesday.   But don't check the tracking through TOR....

    I don't have the tracking number anyway, but why is that eclipsin? I hope the vendor knows better but i am sure he does. It would seem normal to track a package that didn't arrive the day you were expecting it legit or otherwise. Would seem more strange if the number wasn't checked

    This seems to have been an issue. Two customers of ours who were supposed to receive their packages yesterday (Saturday) didn't yet delivery was 'guaranteed'. Blah.

    so, i talk to my vendor today and he said that the package came up redirect/resort, which seems like its USPS saying we fucked up and sent you package the wrong direction. Hopefully it gets sorted out and here by Tuesday.

    just a heads-up---
    <br/>
    I ordered a package from the West Coast to the Deep South, shipped Friday express...i really expected it to be here saturday.
    <br/>
    I was slightly disappointed when it did not show up.
    <br/>
    But ia was REALLY surprised when USPS knocked on my door this morning - Sunday - to make the delivery....
    <br/>
    Package was knot opened and had not been inspected. Person delivering said they were working over to get out stuff scheduled for monday, since it was holiday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never seen them deliver on a sunday before...

    USPS Express will deliver on Sunday for an extra fee/option that the shipper can pay for...they used to deliver on Sunday for all Express packages but they changed it over to an extra option.

    mine finally showed up, the package looked like it got ran over by a truck. There were holes and the envelope was tore to pieces. They had to put it in a plastic sleeve that had an printed apology on it. Thank god my vendor did a good job making it stealth. I almost think USPS opened the package then didn't find anything, so they made it look like it got damaged during delivery. I'm not going to use that address again for awhile, at least until i can tell my ebay and amazon packages are making it to me without being opened.

    Good to hear it finally showed up! Yeah I've had some packages arrive looking like they've been to hell and back with all kinds of holes and shit in them but I'm happy so long as the product is there and there's nothing missing.
