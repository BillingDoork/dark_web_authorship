    Got my first order from a vendor and it came in a basic with envelope with abnormally larger font on the outside.  The back was just normally licked and had a small tear.  Inside was three sheets of plain white 8.5" x 11" paper and rolled up in it was a baggie with my 10 pills.  Is this normal?  My secretary even said "This envelope feel weird."  Is this normal or just terrible shipping?  Thanx

    Thanks.  I didn't think that was industry standard.  I know sellers are trying to keep their overhead down but this was ridiculous.

    Was that domestic shipping?  That might fly for something sent in the same country, but it's horrible for international.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had packs of pills shipped from the Netherlands and from Germany from a couple of dealers, packaging was top notch and looks like it was designed to defeat x-ray machines. I've had weed shipped domestic that was triple vacuum sealed and looked to the casual inspector like something else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd recommend sending the dealer feedback - hopefully it'll help them improve their stealth. Would also advise you doing business with them again until they improve their shipping methods.

    Even for domestic that's pretty bad, I wouldn't use that vendor again and you should probably name them for the safety of others, I would be pretty pissed if that was sent to me like that.

    I can pretty much guarantee you that this vendor spent as little money as possible in his packaging, because A) Obviously, he wanted to save money and B) He doesn't give a shit if you get busted or not. As long as he gets his money.
    <br/>
    Unfortunately, I've gotten shipments like this too. Once I ordered some 4-FA and got a regular-letter envelope and inside was the bag of powder. And that's IT. You could totally feel that there was a baggy of powder in there. Needless to say I found a new vendor...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fact of the matter is, there will always be vendors like this. But fortunately for us, a rather efficient rating system exists for this very reason.  :)

    I ordered ketamine from overseas, (uk) and it was 3 sheets of paper folded up with a little baggie inside. I thought it was ok because it felt like a normal letter on the outside. If it was opened it would be seen right away. For domestic shipping i would not give it a second thought. If you want super stealth be prepared to pay for it.

    I'm a vendor and ex-mailing industry worker of 5 years, and the fact that your secretary said it felt funny is just unacceptable shipping practices. Wouldn't ever reccomend shipping pills (more than 1-3) in a regular envelope. Even with padding or protection envelopes go through many high speed sorting units which squeeze them flat directly at the center so a barcode can be sprayed/read at the lower right hand corner.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't place an order with anyone who's product came like that.... tsk tsk to whoever vendor it was

    I've been here longer than any of you.  Honestly, that's not the worst packaging i've heard of.  In fact I've received packages similar from MAJOR vendors.  I would NOT be ok with pills being shipped in a regular envelope, but powder or anything else that's small enough without bulk is MORE THAN FINE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You guys haven't been around to see the science of stealth evolve here.  It's gotten A LOT better, but if it made it to you and they don't have a bunch of other people saying it didn't show, the packaging is obviously doing it's job well enough.

    Just because there are worse stealth jobs than this doesn't make this shitty packaging job any more acceptable. When I was younger I would order tylenol 4 from some random company, they would come from Latin America. The packages were so obvious. They had like 20 stamps on them, and nothing but pills in really loud plastic notches was in the packages. Every once in a while it would get snatched up by customs, and I'd get a letter telling me to not order those things. The company would always replace it with no proof whatsoever. It was really cool of them, but honestly, it would probably cost them less to be more stealthy, never mind the damage done to their reputations as sellers. SR vendors have a huge incentive to maintain a good rep, so these things should and have gotten much better over time. Only buy from vendors who have good reps as stealthy shippers, it will help improve things for all of us over time by motivating stealthiness.

    As far as dogs are concerned LSD is not odorless. I ship Research chemicals and do not vac seal because they are obscure and dogs are not trained to sniff them out. There has also been quite a bit of discussion that vac sealing doesn't stop a dog unless done very carefully and time in the mail system is limited to pervert permeation through the bag. Of course vac seal is better than nothing though, just keep in mind it is not fool proof :)
