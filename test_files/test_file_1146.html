    So I have 2 orders that are 11 business days and 8 business days in that haven't showed yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Decided to skip priority and order express from another vendor. First one arrived overnight, next order is 3 days late now, express.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I used my real name and address, I don't have any sneaky roommates or neighbors. Thoughts?
    <br/>
    I'm out 400 bucks so far and getting worried.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also the first two that are missing were sent via priority, domestically, from vendors I have ordered with before.

    USPS is being shitty as hell lately dude. I'm waiting on a Priority envelope that I ordered over two weeks ago. I know I did not write an incorrect address and the vendor has an amazing track record. Several other people in the thread I posted in are waiting too, it's on the second page.

    Ahh good. This thread puts my mind at ease. I received three packages today, one marked in transit Saturday, one Monday and one Tuesday, all domestic but I am waiting on one package that is priority that was marked in transit Saturday May 18th and of course, I'm nervous as all get out that it has been intercepted and that tomorrow or Saturday or maybe Tuesday of next week I'll get a good old fashioned controlled delivery and end up in handcuffs. But knowing that you guys have waited even longer eases my troubled mind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am sorry though that you're waiting so long. There's honest-to-God nothing worse than waiting longer than usual and having all these thoughts race through your mind like "am I busted? Is this it? Is it my turn now?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep me updated and I'll let you guys know too if I get my final pack.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take care and be safe!

    Just wanted to update, the other package did show up. The vendor ended up having some shipping issues and had to reship. Still never got those priority orders, one gave mr a full refund since he didnt use tracking, and the other i just finalized since it was only about 40 bucks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally am just going to use express from now on. Makes that waiting game a lot less stressful
