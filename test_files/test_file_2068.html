    Hi guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll quickly say it again, this is a great community and a great thing that this opportunity exists, so thank-you and welldone to you all for being a part of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm new to all this and I'm just wondering how much of a risk I'm taking in ordering LSD from outside the UK from say the Netherlands as opposed to ordering it domestically.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've heard LSD is a pretty safe thing to order anyway as it has no bulk or smell. If anyone has any opinions on that please chip in. The reason I ask is because if I buy from the Netherlands from say FlyingDutchman (again any opinions please chip in?) then I'll be getting about twice as much for my money as if I order from the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any experience on this would be awesome, this is my first purchase and I've been secure in the process, LiveUSB and encryption and such, so I should be sound even if I got caught I think it's more about seizure, but if there's a high risk it'll get seized I'd rather buy domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance to you all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CCF.

    I don't have specific experience in the UK unfortunately...But I can say this. LSD is invisible once blotted on some paper, and odorless--i couldn't think of better traits for an illegal substance to ship internationally. Throw it in with some fake documents, it's as thin as a letter envelope with no smell--I couldn't even imagine how you would get caught with it :D I'd say you have nothing to worry about, but let's see what the veterans on here say.

    Thanks for posting buddy. I hope you're right, as the order's in now so I'll update if I get it. I like to think there's no way they could get it, but we'll see, some people on reviews say they aren't receiving there's. Hopefully I'm one of the lucky ones :).
