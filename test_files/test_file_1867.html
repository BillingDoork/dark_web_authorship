    i have a fairly enormous library of videos and audio, and i have looked at all the download offers and thought id like to make money out of my "stock" but im confused. how on earth would one provide a means of delivering files as big as hd video anonymously. tor is way too slow to offer series downloads, and i cant understand how you could give anyone links to websites or ftp that could be anonymous and torrents are too public. any ideas would be great. obviously nothing specific.

    Who the hell would want to pay for something they could easily download or torrent for free? Sounds shady to me.

    Use jumbofiles.com.  you can rar the files and put them in parts.  It accepts 1gb file uploads so set the file size to 700 mb.  Once you upload the files, just provide the buyers with the links to all the parts. It seems annoying but it is the easiest way I found.

    And I thought the same thing wannagethigh, but then I put a few listings up to test the SR waters and I haven't had a sober weekend since I started thanks to the coin coming in.

    Using jumbofiles doesn't make you anonymous it just provides a way to transport large files.  To protect your ip you can use thing like other peoples wifi or a proxy.  Use your imagination.  http://whatismyipaddress.com/hide-ip
