    Hypothetically...would it get "returned" to the buyer? Thus free shipping?

    The only way that MIGHT work is if you are mailing from within the same area as the person you want to receive it. Otherwise it will end up in the dead letter office or perhaps be delivered postage due. Think about it. If that trick worked people would be doing it all the time.

    It seems highly risky, for one thing of the return address zip most likely not being anywhere near the zip of the PO or bluebox where it is dropped. Maybe for really small orders you might save something, but I don't think we'd really worry about $10 in postage for orders in 100's of $.
