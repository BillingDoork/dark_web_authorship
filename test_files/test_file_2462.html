    i need a forged email from amazon to pick up a package that i wasn't supposed to use a fake name for. i only faked my first name and not my address...
    <br/>
    the girl at the counter said it needed to contain the tracking number, and needed to explain that it was a miscommunication...
    <br/>
    how can i do this????

    This seems suspicious but....

    <br/>
    A) you can always save an email in HTML form then edit it in Dreamweaver which I do often.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    B) Write a letter from the "Fake" person to you saying you have permission to collect it, and take bills etc proving you live there.

    I have a few I could give you. Are you basically looking for one that affirms the order details were wrong and you are the correct parcel receiver?
