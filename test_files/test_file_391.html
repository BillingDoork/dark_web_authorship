    I recently had an order come through and the vendor wrote something like "signature is not required" on the package.  For some reason, someone at the post office circled it, drew a line from the circle and wrote sus.  Anyone know what that means?  My first thought was suspicious, but the package wasn't opened or tampered with in any way (that I could tell), and it's been a while since it was received.  Just curious if anyone has noticed stuff written on their package.

    I've had many packages come to me with all kinds of stuff written on them (especially Express packages and signature waivers), postal employees ise all kinds of abbreviations or make notes on the packages...it's pretty normal and I doubt you have anything to worry about.

    Sounds like you dodged a bullet.

    I can't think of any practical SUS acronyms that would fit the signature requirements of a mail article... Signature Upon S...something is about as close as I can get. That, and the fact that what was written on the package "Signature not required" is in fact--in my opinion--a little suspicious, leaves me thinking that a mail clerk noticed it and marked it as suspicious. Judging from it arriving unmolested, it seems that it was either not followed up or when it was checked over nothing was found. Given that a warrant is required before USPS staff can open mail packages, they may have just not had the resources to give it a proper inspection.

    I think you should let your vendor know about this. Even if it was something else, the less attention any package draws the better.

    Signature Not Required is a quite common thing to find on a tracked package, express etc, you can even get little stickers ready printed. European packages i receive often have it :)
