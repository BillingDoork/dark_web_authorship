    If it's international and priority mail I would wait up to 21 days maybe even 30 in some cases.  I've also had an express international order take 21+ days to arrive.  USPS is fucked as of... well ever so 7 days shouldn't be ringing any alarms yet. give it time =]

    If it's UK to UK it should be with you by now most items arrive within 2/3 days although with Xmas coming up it may be a bit longer.
    <br/>
    1. It's either not been sent.
    <br/>
    2. It wasn't sent when the vendor said - maybe posted it later.
    <br/>
    3. It's disappeared into a postie's pocket!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Saying that I did have one order that arrived 3/4 weeks later!!! Don't know what happened there.
    <br/>
    Hope you ordered from a vendor with good stats  :)

    It still never turned up but i trusted the vendor that much that i've had three packages make it through via tracking and special delivery :) I've ordered another package today via SD and for the lost package he's giving me about a 30% refund which i can't complain with :) By the way i'm in the UK so knowing my luck a dirty postie stole it &gt;.&lt; lame! I doubt it going to turn up at all now haha!  No Sticks, No Seeds = Trusted vendor! ^_^ Thanks for your help though guys!

    30% is far too low when it was either seized or stolen. In either case, it means the vendor's packaging was shit-enough that the postal workers realized what was in it.
