    I just wanted to check my thinking here
    <br/>
    <br/>
    International shipping (Europe to Asia)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ecstasy pills Vs MDMA powder
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is this a no brainer?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is the powder way less risky?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    or is there not really a lot in it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if there isn't a lot in it, and you wanted a total of 30-40 pills, would it be wiser to make multiple orders of 10?, or just 1 big order of say 50?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the logic/risk assessment part of my brain is going crazy on this question
    <br/>
    <br/>
    on the one hand I feel that anything under 100 pills is basically no big deal and no worse than a few grams of powder
    <br/>
    <br/>
    on the other hand I'm of a mind that any amount of pills is already asking for trouble because the shape and solidity is a fundamental red flag in itself
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FYI I've checked 5 years worth of customs records for airports round here and all the E seizures are for in the region of 10,000 - 700,000 beans, and none of those this year
    <br/>
    All the recent busts have been for Meth or Weed (and a bit of H)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In this whole thing
    <br/>
    it's really hard to know where to draw the line between sensible caution and borderline paranoia &gt;_&lt;

    and I would add to my query
    <br/>
    <br/>
    would pills that are not the traditional pill shape be any better?
    <br/>
    or is it just marginal differences at that point?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I noticed that there occasionally brands of E that are not circular such as shield shaped or triangular ones etc

    I am also thinking about your described concerns. Got one order on the way to a friend down there, will update how it went down.

    well with powder, there's a better chance of using flat envelopes (easily run through sorting systems/scanners) and making it seem like it was a plain letter unless you ordered a large amount hwere you were sent rocks.. as with pills, they are vacuumsealed tightly together and wrapped up to where you couldn't tell they were pills from the outside but since they can't be as flat, more likely come in a bubble mailer or still fit in a flat envelope but with some thickness... they'd have to be opened and then the seal would have to be tampered for anybody to really know what it was.. they don't jingle around the envelope freely or that vendor has no knowledge of stealth packaging.. every vendor has their own special way of packaging various amounts, i would leave it up to them to decide based on their success and experience..
