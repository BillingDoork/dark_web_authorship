    Hey everyone I know I'm new to the forums but I've used SR multiple times in the last year and a half.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I come here today because of my last order I made a few months ago. It was a small pack of opiates, and I had them shipped through express (overnight). On the vendors page was no where saying "will have to sign" so as my mailman arrived he required a signature. I nearly had a panic attack and he confirmed to me that someone had to sign. He knew I was acting strange but after a few seconds I ended up signing for it. The package itself had been checked for it not to require a signature, but then I noticed that the vendor wrote my address incorrectly. Also the package was very obvious due to its shape. So I ended up getting what I wanted but with too much unnecessary stress.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I realized I'll never try express again, but now that I've signed for this package should I be worried about using SR? I'm afraid after this shipment that my house has been flagged in some way when it comes to me ordering other packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Looking forwards to peoples opinions

    I would never be worried amount, but never assume there will be no backlash...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THIS IS DRUG SMUGGLING/IMPORTATION people, irrespective of the quantity. I have heard of controlled deliveries for 1g of MDMA...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If in doubt, stay free and dont use SR

    From everywhere I have read you should not have to sign for a package ever, unless you previously discussed this with the vendor prior to shipment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To play it safe, I would send a polite message to that vendor and ask him if he intended to have you sign for it. If he didn't I would let him know of the mishap so he can make his packages more stealth in the future, and as for yourself I would try to use a different address for a while to play it safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck. Keep your butthole safe.

    If the check box was checked that you didn't need to sign and you pointed this out the the mailman then you shouldn't have signed.  It isn't worth the risk.

    The package was checked for the "Do not sign" but the vendor misspelled my fucking address. Any way fuck me the deny part was what I was worried about, probably calling it quits here.

    So the address was slightly off but good enough for USPS to figure it out.  That still wasn't reason to make you sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor needs to not be so sloppy though.  I'm guessing the vendor has their fingerprints all over that package.

    As a vendor, I always ship with a method that does not require signature. For example, express with no signature option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I was buying something, and the seller never told me that I needed a signature, when it arrived and required a signature I would probably not accept it to be safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then I would open a resolution and request a full refund, why? Because the seller did not provide what he should have been providing, a shipping method that does not require a signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always read vendor profile pages, make sure you understand their terms (not saying you didn't). However its totally possible that nothing went wrong and you got lucky.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck
