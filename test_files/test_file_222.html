    In case you haven't thought of it, I thought that if you're shipping, especially bigger than an envelope, or either way. You should get a hold of some Holiday stickers. Santa Claus, Happy Holidays, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This time of year they are innundated with these types of things, and are a lot less likely to pay attention to one with Frosty the Snowman, or Santa Claus stickers all over them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a friendly tip. Someone may have touched on it somewhere else, but it doesn't hurt to be reminded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Happy Holidays to all!

    I've thought of suggesting a something similar to vendors recently...Just because I will be doing  most of my holiday shopping online anyways...I'll be expecting a lot of legitimate packages as christmas gifts I'll be giving to family and friends.

    People would pay LESS attention to the parcel covered in bright stickers?

    I was just about to remove this, but had to respond. YES!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You don't get that? I guess you have an innocent mind.  Just picture the mail sorting room 2 weeks ago, anywhere USA- England - Germany.  There were TONS of parcels all odd shapes and sizes going through these centers. So if you've already handled 150, parcels, and sorted them into the right bins by coffee break, and 70-80% of those parcels/letters had Santa, a Snowman, Angels, a Menorah, Christmas stickers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You think one more is going to "stand out". Or will the parcel looking very plain, with no return address "stand out"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You see the logic now? - I'll leave this up a few more days. Just so you "get it". You need to understand how to "blend in". Maybe it's because I have 3 older sisters, and their mother was 4H. They have stickers and glitter for every holiday!  In another month it will be pink envelopes, with hearts. The month after, they'll be sending cards or parcels that are green, have shamrocks, and Leprechauns all over them. If I were a vendor, I'd follow the Holiday Calendar. They expect to see these things at these times, so there is no way in hell, their boss is going to listen to one worker who "feels something" in the envelope. - The boss will say, "It's a goddamn Christmas present! Get back to work!"
