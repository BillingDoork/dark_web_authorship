    Lets not! We don't need another thread on issues covered in existing threads. If an item of yours hasn't arrived in a timely manner, PM the vendor or take the matter to the R.C when you receive an email from SR Support. Some things are better left unsaid or discussed behind closed doors.

    Yep, nothing is getting into australia anymore, nada, zip, zero..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So yeah customs should just stop looking because overseas vendors are no longer sending to Oz.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If for some strange bizarre reason a vendor did send you something, i'd just leave feed back on his page..not here. ;)

    Yeah don't bother with OS vendors as they wont send a thing as they dont want to deal with the hassles. I made one last purchase from Germany thinking it will arrive..been over 3 weeks now and i have given up any hope.

    <br/>
    Looks like customs have won this one cunts. Sure we can still get other shit in but anything pill related just dont bother. Even prescription shit.

    i have had 4 orders in the last two months not show up ..... one of them was the vendors first no show had tracking and all,
    <br/>
    recently there was another thing on tv about silk road, from what i have read once they accidentally "advertise" SR customs do massive blitz for a couple of weeks as the number of uses increase when people find out they can buy amazing quality on this beautiful road :)
    <br/>
    shame customs are ass holesÂ  ;D however i know for a fact that they do miss a lot of things in small quantities as they cant check nor have the man power to look over millions of mail per week its not possible. it would fuck the flow of mail and cause massive delays.
    <br/>
    Personally i think its just hit and miss, or just order small :)

    No doubt that does occur chilliafterglow. A vendor's packaging materials and the way an item is stealthily packaged and presented is the key factor in an item arriving from O/S. Once I find vendors I feel have the art of packaging down to a tee, I stick with them. I found mine through trial and error and doing some homework. I've been very fortunate in hindsight to have used vendors who operate so professionally and reliably. Order some small quantities off a variety of vendors to gauge how they ship their items. Then stick with the best. They are out there.Â  :)

       Geez GUS, I don't know who you have been ordering off but I truthfully have received all but one of my O/S orders (my 2nd order didn't show) and there have been many.

    question: if customs does grab it, do they send you a letter? a lot of international vendors say you gotta produce a scan of this letter to get a refund; I've only made one international purchase; it didn't come and luckily I got a refund without a request for the non-existent letter (80% refund, which looking at a lot of vendors is pretty fucking generous).
