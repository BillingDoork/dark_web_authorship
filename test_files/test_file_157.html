    I live with other people.  I'm debating on shelling the extra cash to get a PO Box, but I'm hoping with some confirmation here, that it won't be necessary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is a small risk that someone might open my mail by accident.  I will be ordering small amounts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it a breach of etiquette to ask the vendor how they will ship the product?  I read on one vendors' page that "it will look like something else".  I'm hoping this is what it means, that the order will be stored in something concealing and if someone were to open the envelope/package that they will just see a can of food or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    The whole 'Stealth' thing... well... mileage varies greatly. Many times it seems 'stealth' just means the outside of the package is inconspicuous — which should be par for course, but who knows what people are thinking sometimes. Personally, you could open one of our packages while sitting in the middle of a police station and be good as long as you were quick on your toes. Obviously don't want to give anything away (and most vendors won't [and shouldn't]), but, to me at least, that is what 'stealth' should mean.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It should also go without saying that other people shouldn't be opening your mail. Not only is it illegal, it's highly disrespectful in communal living arrangements... but to each their own.

    You must be a kid living at home with mom and dad.  There is no other reason that you should be worried that someone will open your mail.  You don't need to mess with drugs while your brain is still developing.  If things are rough at home try and join a club or something at school.

    'Stealth' basically means that if the package was inspected, the actual product ordered would not be detected reasonably.  For example, I've had packages come where it's just the drugs straight inside the padded envelope vacuum sealed.  While it looked professional on the outside, the contents would have been easily discoverable upon customs inspection (this was an international order).  I've also had orders come with a fake invoice for a legit product with a sealed pouch full of the contents which were masked as a legal powder, but really was my drugs concealed inside of this.

    The more stealthy the packaging, the more likely customs or anybody else will be able to not detect your product.

    Stealth is always important on large amounts coming from international-remember, what we're doing is highly illegal and the better concealed your product is, the more likely it is to pass through just fine and not cause you any problems!

    I agree. Personally, I think SR should implement a "Stealth Clause" into the vendor's agreement; Basically stating that if you "advertise" stealth shipping, that you must adhere to a certain protocol in regards to said packaging. In my opinion, "stealth" is defined as "Packaging which could be opened by an inspector of some sort, customs or otherwise, and stand more than a reasonable chance of not warranting a second look/further inspection." Also, buyer's need to be more unbiased in regards to leaving feedback concerning packaging. Don't leave feedback saying "Yeah great stealth!!!" just because you received your order and you're quite giddy. Other buyers rely on feedback to help determine who to purchase from, etc. If a vendor claims stealth, it damn well ought to be so.

    What does stealth mean to me as both a buyer and a vendor?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A mailing that looks to be of a "commercial" origin with a laser or thermal printed address. If it has to go in a bubble mailer, using one with a plastic envelope coating and not a paper one for durability. Small enough to fit in a mailbox. No Delivery Confirmation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The real contents shouldn't be visible if the package is opened, meaning it's stuffed inside another object or the packaging is opaque.
    <br/>
    The package should contain some kind of invoice/packing slip/letter that describes what the contents APPEAR to be to a postal worker opening the package for whatever reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stealth means to me that there is several layers of deception. That's how I operate.

    Without saying too much, to be really Stealth it needs basically 3 steps:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Properly Sealing.
    <br/>
    note: Nowadays there are alternatives to vacuum or to use in conjunction to vacuum.
    <br/>
    2. Exterior of the package/envelope. How does it look, how does it feel.

    3. Interior.

    I can confirm this as true. After all, plutopete holds the key that opens the door to stealth packaging. He defines stealth, and I'm sure any customs officers that had the privilege of inspected such a creative, safe, and hilarious package that plutopete put together. So to sum this up... stealth=plutopete. Search is your friend and not just on the forums ;-)

    Agreed. I'm sick of seeing giddy first timers giving 5/5 when I've used the same vendor and their "stealth" was to vacuum pack only once on a powder that has a well known odour to it. Seriously it this package was opened customs would only have to flick through 2 pieces of paper to discover it. Does that vendor really care if I'm busted or not? I've heard good things about googleyed (sp).

    No matter how good your stealth/decoy is if customs have already opened your pacakge they WILL find your contraband! The best thing a vendor can do is to package it in a way so that it blends with every other package. Make it look boring, make it look like any other piece of mail. The last thing u want to do is draw attention to your package. Make the item look like the description so that when it gets x-rayed theirs no suspicsion. Imagine a vendor sending a package with a half pound of weed and declaring it as toys? of course customs will see its not toys and open it. Even with the weight, if the package says it weighs 5 pounds but actually weighs 7 pounds it'll make customs suspicious and they'll end up opening it. I was watching a show where someone sent coke in canned soup. On the can it says the weight was 450 grams but when customs went to go weigh it out it came to 390 grams. Customs got suspicious so they opened it and they found coke concealed in the can. This was on border security: Australia's frontline, pretty good show.

    not going to quote that again, fuck me. i will never comprehend why people find it so difficult to keep their mouths shut or keep shit to themselves. this applies to so much shit, but thats another rant. i understand the likelihood that law enforcement somewhere has possibly ordered and dissected much of what is available on here, but did they make a post like yours regarding their findings? sharing details and dropping a vendor's name? what was going through your head as you bashed that out and hit post? no, really? wheres your respect for the sellers mate? youve obviously got none.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    to add something to the thread:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    stealth has typically meant discrete. something you wouldn't ever pick out amongst the other mail. vacuum sealed to prevent passive detection of odour.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    that's what i'm often told to be "stealth"... basically, youre fine unless it gets opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    getting a product sent on after it's been examined is definitely something to claim and be proud of. that's some true stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hope you caught something useful from that. i caught aids just writing it.
    <br/>

    Can the moderators just start deleting accounts of those who are posting this shit, if that started happening it might reduce the number of fuckwits on here, I knowing there are a growing number and it might seem like swimming against the tide but posts like that are just dangerous, it defies belief some of the shit people are throwing up in here.
