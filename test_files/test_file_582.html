    I recently moved into a place and we get mail addressed to a guy who used to live here.  It actually may be part of the family that owns the house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I thought about just using that name as he still gets mail here.
    <br/>

    Thoughts?

    Good idea, but you won't be able to pick up larger envelopes/packages from the post office as they will require your ID with the name of the guy on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So make sure you tell the people you buy from to send you envelopes small enough to fit in the mailbox, and stuff that do NOT require signing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise, pretty good catch.

    Yeah, I used to use a neighbour's mailbox. A guy who is never home &amp; shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Until one day, one guy sent me an envelope which wasn't big enough to fit in the mailbox. So the post guy left a note telling me (or that guy who never lives there) to go to the post office with the ID to pick up the "oversized envelope". So the package was lost.

    You can still pick up a package like this.  Tell them the name on the package is your roommate, or boyfriend, or girlfriend.  I've done it before.  As long as your photo ID has the correct address on it you can pick it up.

    Unless over sized as stated then, yeah sure. I still get mail for a woman that owned my house before me..... 10+years ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Postal carrier still just drops it in the box/slot. Probably because I never return it to the sender. I just throw it out. Always junk mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I use to order a bunch of free (legal) shit off the net back in the day (can't remember the site) like samples and such. Anyway I use to use any name that came to mind. I then had come to find out (this was years ago) that the shit is "free" because they sell your name and address to snail spam you. I then decided to start keeping track of what name I used for what "freebie" and then what junk mail I would get under that name in the following months. I got kinda sick with it actually. I started to care more about the snail spam then any freebie.
    <br/>
    Point is. I had about 20-35 different names coming to a single home. Only thing ANYONE ever said about it, was my postal carrier at the time handed me a stack of mail with a bunch of different names and said "daaaannnng, how manys people you got livin dere?"
    <br/>
    My reply: "A lot" **snatch**

    Just a caution.  I too get mail for the old resident, but only junk mail.  My postal carrier returns anything that appears to be of value (like 1st class mail and other packages).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do I know?  He told me one day that he is still returning mail to sender for the old residents.  See, they had a small clothing shop and we got their orders for months!  Postman picked up on this and started returning to sender.  So, I don't think he bothers to sort out the junk mail, but he does with 1st class mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think I would send myself a priority package in the former residents name to see if it arrives.

    Yes, but do a safe test package first.   Mail forwarding usually doesn't capture the junk mail.  I moved once and all the bulk/junk kept arriving at the old address along with some of my important mail.  Don't think the post office is especially efficient.  You may want to use a different first name, but the same last name too.  Do you know if the guy has a brother or cousin who's name you could use?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, you never know when the old resident might walk into the post office and set up or fix the forwarding if he's missing important mail.  Some people freak out when the find drugs in the mail and call the cops.  Many  people have a distorted view of how criminal justice works.  They may think that if drugs are under their name that the cops may be investigating and ready to arrest him at any time.  Maybe he has kids, etc, average eople scare easily when it comes to the police.  They can't see that one package that they didn't order is like a needle in a hay stack that will not matter.

    It would be really unfortunate if you used a previous residents name and the package ended up getting forwarded to his new address. I always just use a random fake name. Works every time.

    Lol that's the trick i have used for 5 months, the name of a guy who has quit my country for south africa (He work for unicef maybe?) anyway i have moved to another place now and i use another trick i don't want to wrote on here... oh i almost forgot, sometimes mail services offer redirection mail for like 2 months for people that move to another place (to let them the time to change address with governments, credit cards, etc ..) so if this is the case it's possible your package will be redirected to the new address of the person (at least it's true with canadapost) i have been lucky to know that the guy has quit the country  ;D

    If you live in the united states: DO NOT USE FAKE NAMES.  Either use your real name, or get a good fake ID and get a post office box in that name and use it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ship weed domestically and have sent over 140 packages with no problems at all, I'm estimating a non-delivery rate of less than 0.5% from those numbers.  Why screw that up by using a fake name?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in a small town and know my postmaster reasonably well, I give her free eggs every once in a while.  Anyways when I first moved here I asked about the junk mail that I get that was supposed to go to the previous resident and she said they don't usually bother forwarding junk mail or RTSing it since either way they figure it goes in the trash.  She said if it looks important "like bills" they'll make an effort with that.  Then she made a joke about if she sees anything valuable going to the former resident she'll let it slide, but it's too bad nobody ever sends gifts to old addresses .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    She's right about that.  If you move you're not exactly buying something online using your old address, and just about everybody who moves tells their loved ones they moved (so no gifts).  Most people who move leave a forwarding address, and even years later the USPS can look it up if need be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How often does amazon send DVDs to your house that were intended for the previous resident?  that's right, never.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And here's the kicker: The USPS carriers generally know the names of the people who live at the residence.  They actually have (at least in my area) a list of last names for each house or apartment.  The letter carriers over time get used to who lives where.  If they see a PACKAGE for a previous resident it will likely arouse suspicion.  If they notice that at best they'll take it back to the PO, comment on how weird it is and try to forward or return it.  At worst they'll flag it for inspection.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I make my packages look like e-bay packages, most sellers make their packages look like E-commerce packages.  So that going to a fake name or a previous resident does look very suspicious.  In my case I use randomly chosen return address &amp; names.  If one of those packages bounces you can bet there's a good chance that the person it bounces to will either immediately notify their postmaster or carrier or they'll call the cops.  Either way now the postal inspectors have the drug filled package with your address on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they launch an investigation they'll immediately realize 3 thing:
    <br/>
    -If it was the previous resident trying to get drugs mailed to him there's no way he'd "forget" and use his old address.
    <br/>
    -most likely somebody at this house is involved in "interstate trafficking of narcotics" and we'll get pig points for busting him.
    <br/>
    -we can't do a signature delivery because that person doesn't actually live there, we'll just have to find a judge who'll let us just stick it in his mail and observe from a distance and then bust down the door whenever ANYONE gets the mail (most judges would probably be OK with that).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they absolutely do not have to get a signature from you for a controlled delivery in the USA.  They just need a method by which they do not lose control of the drugs and they need a judge to sign off on the conditional warrant whatever that technique may be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So think about that for a while before you go and make up fake names or use previous residents.  And compare that to the 99+% chance of success people have using PO boxes or their real name/address.

    Great post Bob :D.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stick to using your real-name, it obviously raises the least possible suspicion. If it gets to the stage of controlled delivery then you've got a much stronger case if you signed in your own name. Know your postman, surely if it is him then signing should be fine. Sign for it, leave it down immediately and then keep an eye on him, see if he delivers more post and observe if he communicates with anyone. Then you'll surely know whether to open that package or not ;). To be honest, if they were going to bust in it'd be hella quick so you probably wouldn't get the chance but for letters (non-signed for) you will be able to keep an eye on the postman.
