    I'm desperate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been to all the post offices locally and ALL of the employees are rude as hell and don't even look up at me most of the time just say NO when I ask for "Prepaid tracking labels/stamps".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do all these weed vendors ship with tracking? It looks as if they just print off something. But then how is that anonymous?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've searched and searched for a week, and SR is in a need for my product at the moment, however I don't want to continue to sell with no-tracking.

    To print labels online you have to print the entire label online and pay for it. A lot of vendors do it but other vendors think it's very risky because they feel it might be traced back to their USPS account and linked to them through their financial information which they used to pay, etc.

    Tip...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tracking labels can be printed.  Do your shipping on random days logging into Wifi spots around your accounts area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Greendot Prepaid "opened with a fake name"
    <br/>
    2. USPS account with that fake name
    <br/>
    3. Print labels to .PDF so you can print them when you get home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Rotate the areas...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mcdonalds
    <br/>
    Starbucks
    <br/>
    Free Hot Spots
    <br/>
    Apt Complex's "lots of open Wifi's"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep it random
    <br/>
    <br/>
    7am 1pm 8pm etc..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This will insure if packages get tracked back the Feds will be watching those spots but if its to random its going to make it a lost cause...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not saying I have an experience,  LOL

    Doesn't work. When registering green-dots they require you to provide your social security number and all your real information which must be verified before the card can be used.

    Then what about doing the above except print labels with no postage? Still open a USPS account with a fake name, use public WiFi and so forth, but print labels with no postage and then affix your own stamps in the appropriate amount and drop your packs in a blue dropbox. Yes? No?

    They don't allow you to print a no postage label.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been in the same boat as you for a long time yoursuppliersr,
    <br/>
    The only way I can figure is make a USPS account with fake info via tor. Somehow get a card with fake info.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The real question is, how can you get a green dot card anonymously?

    Not a fan as buyer information is entered to be provided to the print the label. Most big business do real time data back-up meaning "data capture"

    <br/>
    ie... you are in that shipper (lazy if done from home) or may somewhat creative doing WiFi @ remote local still a record of the interaction exists

    I worked for a storage company they do collect a good amount of daily data

    In reality everyone would be safer if all sellers just used stamps. Unfortunately without tracking if an item goes into resolution, the buyer can scam.

    How do they do it? I will tell you how they do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They order online the postage online from USPS or a related website with real information/real payment information, though probably not of their own, at least it would be dumb to use their own. All they'd have to do is use someone's information who doesn't dabble in any illegal activity, and obviously this someone would have to consent to an extent. If police ever track the payment back they will run into this person who doesn't do anything illegal and all a vendor can do is put their trust in this person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Little do many people know you can order tracking labels for free on the USPS website and stamps.com, though since they are free they literally take forever to get to you. I actually had orders placed for 1000 tracking labels (5 orders of 200 to different houses), and none of them ever shipped out or arrived. I even used real information on some of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These are just 2 ways to do it. Personally I believe a lot of vendors take a huge risk and use their real information with tracking. Honestly I don't feel it to be that much of a risk... if LE are going to bust you through that manner it would require a lot of effort and resources, as well as multi-department co-operation, and even further co-operation with the USPS website management, and/or the management of paypal, all of which may yield no results at all or lead to a person who had their credit card stolen, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are ways to do it, but honestly it's not worth the hassle. For most vendors 99/100 orders arrive perfectly fine, at least with domestic orders. From my experience, and talked with a few domestic only USA vendors, very few ever even have a need for tracking as all their packages arrive.

    HEY! I just last week had a buddy of mine go into the post office for me with the sole intention of getting as many tracking stickers as possible. He said he needed them because he ships parcels on eBay, and the postman basically said we dont usually just hand these out, but whatever, here you go. And handed over like 24 tracking stickers for free. I would keep trying different post offices and asking the same question with a decent back story. Im sure youll eventually get them.

    You can absolutely print a label with tracking and no postage using USPS Shipping Assistant, but another poster makes an excellent point, which is that buyer's names and addresses are entered (and almost certainly saved) in the USPS system. This seems like a disservice to buyers, though the vendor would be protected because financial info is not required with Shipping Assistant. I could find no tracking labels to order on the USPS Web site, only labels for certified mail, registered mail, signature confirmation, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems to come down to walking into the post office and paying for postage and tracking across the counter, using cash of course, and just taking your chances with whatever cameras might be in operation. This could be inconvenient if you're sending out more than a few items a week, because going to the post office takes time, especially if you feel the need to go to several different ones. Also, tracking costs 90 cents at the post office, and it's absolutely free if you use online postage. Over the course of a year, 90 cents per item could make a significant difference in the bottom line for a busy vendor.

     It seems to come down to walking into the post office and paying for postage and tracking across the counter, using cash of course, and just taking your chances with whatever cameras might be in operation. This could be inconvenient if you're sending out more than a few items a week, because going to the post office takes time, especially if you feel the need to go to several different ones. Also, tracking costs 90 cents at the post office, and it's absolutely free if you use online postage. Over the course of a year, 90 cents per item could make a significant difference in the bottom line for a busy vendor.

    So I can get those, just put a sticker on a package, put stamps, then drop it in a blue mail box, and I'm good? Do I need to add extra postage for the tracking label??

    although getting paid for this advice is enticing ....heres how you do it:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. find a usps location with an automated kiosk
    <br/>
    <br/>
    www.usps.com/shop/use-self-service-kiosks.htm
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. visit the kiosk and confirm postage options....i think certain locations only carry certain postage options as they may even have a kiosk at your local supermarket...also corfirm payment options [confirm..meaning check that shit out!]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. get a visa gift card or amex gift card (having already confirmed payment options)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. purchase priority forever stamps w/ tracking
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (keep in mind that there is a limit on how many stamps you can buy per transaction)- i forget how many but i would find that out in step 2 before getting the gift card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is a good method because you do not need your id to purchase gift cards so it enables you to be able to throw your pack in the bin and have DCN with no human interaction ;D ;D

    A lot of people say it takes forever for USPS to dispatch those out, or they never even arrive, but it's always worth a shot.

    To your second question, yes, it's that simple. Priority mail includes tracking in the price.

    The problem with this method is that it involves actually stepping foot in a PO box, and that the kiosks have cameras that take your picture with every transaction. You would also have to come in with a list of zip codes for your orders from that day in order to print the priority mail label with the tracking number on it, or just come in with all your packages pre-labeled. My point is, you're sacrificing anonymity for convenience.

    actually theres no problems with this....not for me anyways
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there arent necessarily cameras at every angle of the post office.....i actually manage to go to one with APC out of sight....but even if you are on camera, buying the postage is one of your last concerns....getting seen dropping off a pack containing, a possibly found, illicit item would be far worse  ....then they could zoom in and see the tracking # on the package and incriminate u by the footage...if they ever found you
    <br/>
    - and even to that i say   there are plenty of PO drop bins out of camera sight
    <br/>
    how could they even manage to catch u buying postage ?lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and no you dont need a list of zip codes...usps doesnt create a custom tracking number from your zip
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so you can buy like 10 stamps for example @ a time ...and just drop them off when ready..then once dropped off, scanned and processed, your DCN# will be able to be checked online.
    <br/>

    hope that clears some things up

    You order the labels right here for free. It takes like 6-8 weeks to get them though, so make sure you order enough. My local PO does hand them out, but I have asked at others, and they all said that they don't hand them out, and that you have to order them online.

     You order the labels right here for free. It takes like 6-8 weeks to get them though, so make sure you order enough. My local PO does hand them out, but I have asked at others, and they all said that they don't hand them out, and that you have to order them online.

     <br/>

     3. get a visa gift card or amex gift card (having already confirmed payment options)

     4. purchase priority forever stamps w/ tracking
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (keep in mind that there is a limit on how many stamps you can buy per transaction)- i forget how many but i would find that out in step 2 before getting the gift card.

     <br/>
     this is a good method because you do not need your id to purchase gift cards so it enables you to be able to throw your pack in the bin and have DCN with no human interaction ;D ;D

    I just went into a PO two days ago to drop a few eBay packages with my eBay mailing labels. I asked the lady at the counter politely for some Label 400s since I was having problems with my printer. She gave me a nasty look and told me to my face that if she caught what I was up to with them she would notify LEOs. I talked to her supervisor about her attitude and was still denied the labels. This has made me come to the conclusion that there is something going on behind closed doors that nobody is openly talking about.

    This is the method a nice vendor told me about. There are no kiosks in my area. Do the machines really print out postage with tracking without you inputting sender names and return addresses?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vanilla reload gift cards work online to purchase things so I don't see why they would not work ordering stamps in kiosks as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also I have been denied label #400 tracking stickers wherever I go. I talked one lady into giving me 10 of them when I purchased 10 $5.60 stamps. I'm thinking about ordering them online to be sent to a friends business who gave me permission to do so. I'll be curious to see if they arrive at the business vs a private residence.

      Tracking labels can be printed.  Do your shipping on random days logging into Wifi spots around your accounts area.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      1. Greendot Prepaid "opened with a fake name"
      <br/>
      2. USPS account with that fake name
      <br/>
      3. Print labels to .PDF so you can print them when you get home.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Rotate the areas...

      <br/>
      Mcdonalds
      <br/>
      Starbucks
      <br/>
      Free Hot Spots
      <br/>
      Apt Complex's "lots of open Wifi's"
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Keep it random
      <br/>
      <br/>
      7am 1pm 8pm etc..
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This will insure if packages get tracked back the Feds will be watching those spots but if its to random its going to make it a lost cause...

    It does work, you just use the green dot style cards that are not reloadable.  The cards that are not reloadable do not require SSN or verifying information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, there could be a chance of being record on a security camera when the card is purchased.

     It does work, you just use the green dot style cards that are not reloadable.  The cards that are not reloadable do not require SSN or verifying information.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, there could be a chance of being record on a security camera when the card is purchased.

    Those are the same as loadable debit cards. Only once you attach the SSN the card becomes real.

    At least some prepaid cards definitely do work.  I am 100% sure.

    This is making me wonder if there is a potential business selling single-use prepaid credit cards on SR, for a small loading fee....
