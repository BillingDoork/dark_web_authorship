    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just want to ask you, because i dont know whats up now :-D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My problem is:
    <br/>
    i live in Germany and ordered several times (about 15) different things but all only from domestic vendors.
    <br/>
    the delivery times were always about 1-2 days.
    <br/>
    Now i this month i ordered a few times and about 3 times the orders did take about 4-5 days (a bit long for domestic) but they arrived.
    <br/>
    One package still not arrived, i am waiting for about 5 days now.
    <br/>
    What did happen?
    <br/>
    Busted? I thought small amounts and only domestic is safest way to go.
    <br/>
    The post slow? Might be because the other orders did take about 4-5 days, usually a domestic delivery takes 1-2 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone same problem like me?
    <br/>

    hm definitely a little weird. have you done suspicious stuff through the mail before? or is there any other reason LE would watch your mail? what about the amounts you ordered? i have had orders taken longer than 1-2 days, up to 4 domestically. i thought that was weird too, but so far everything arrived without any issues.

    Hi,
    <br/>
    still nothing in my postbox.
    <br/>
    I did not use this adress before this order, so i am sure there is no reason why LE would watch my mail! I take always different recieving adresses because of my own safety.
    <br/>
    Also i tested another order (domestic from another vendor) on the same adress and the item arrived after 2 days. So i think there is no LE in my case involved...
    <br/>
    The amount was 40 gs of hash, so it is very compact. (i ordered this two times before and both arrived- like always, different adress)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing happened since then, maybe i got scammed because i had to finalize early but the other times i did not get scammed by this vendor...
    <br/>
    Just do not know whats up...

    pls dont forget that it is possible for packages to actually get lost in the mail.
    <br/>
    if another order has arrived since the missing one, marlboro, then you are probably just in very bad luck. order may arrive any day, or in 2 years. as long as you can be relatively certain LE is not watching you, you should just look at it as some lost money...
    <br/>
    being scammed by vendor is unlikely, except the guy took off and you will now find a review thread stating clearly that the vendor has taken people's btc and headed off ...

    last domestic order took 5 days. dunno whats up. usually i get 'em within 2 days. i am not worried though, the mail is probably just overloaded for some reason or has some capacity issues. nothing is wrong with the package i am receiving, so no detection issues. as you can read in many sellers' profiles the mail behaves really weird at times ..
