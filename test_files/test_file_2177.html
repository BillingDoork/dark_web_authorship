     MORE West Australians are turning to the web for their drug habits with a record number of people caught trying to have narcotics delivered by regular post straight to their door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     New figures show record numbers of parcels and envelopes containing drugs are being seized in WA before they drop into the letterboxes of drug users.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Australian Federal Police data reveals between January 1 and August 28 this year, 830 parcels and envelopes destined for WA homes were seized because they contained drugs such as heroin, cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Commander Bradley Shallies of the Australian Federal Police Perth bureau said ``parcel post drugs'' were an increasing challenge for federal police.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He also warned that just because buyers were getting their drugs online instead of a street corner it didn't make them any safer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ``There should be no comfort taken by those who order these substances (online),'' he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ``In the first instance is the question of their own health, they have no idea of what the substances actually are at best, they have only a presumption in regard to what they have ordered.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ``Secondly this behaviour constitutes an offence. A conviction can change a person's life in many ways.''
     <br/>
     Cmd-Shallies said he did not believe websites offering drugs online were based out of WA or Australia.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ``The sites identified to date are offshore,'' he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ``This is consistent with most cyber related offences.''
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Australian Drug Foundation head of policy and advocacy Geoff Munro said the increasing trend of people buying illegal drugs online was worrying.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ``Mail ordering of drugs is a concern because it increases uncontrolled access to potentially hazardous substances and leads to more health problems,'' Mr Munro said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ``When people take illegal drugs they are in effect experimenting on themselves (and) you can never be sure of what you are taking.''
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Four WA people, three men and one woman, were arrested and charged earlier this year in a nationwide blitz targeting parcel post drugs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They were all aged in their early 20s.

    I bet at least 800 of those are from sites like Topix,
    <br/>
    they openly post their email addresses &amp; shit FFS.

    Do your homework, research, using a ssite where vendors &amp; buyers alike are trusted,

     This is just pure bullshit. SR is the safest place to buy drugs. You have the forums to back up what you buy and seller reputation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Buying online also protects you from face to face meetings with certain people who you may not normally even associate with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SR is a life saver and let's users put the best quality drugs in their body. I couldn't be happier a place like this exists.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     830 does sounds like a lot for that time frame, especially if it's WA only. About 100/month hmmmm not sure on thatÂ  :o

    I'm assuming this includes the massive amount of steroids that people try to import. Which stick out like a sore thumb on an xray, just like prescription pills which get ordered online on clearnet sites. SR related packages would represent a tiny fraction of this whole number.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I take this article as good news; 4 arrests out of 830 parcels, I wonder if any were actually found guilty.

    Consider. According to a news article 20 million articles go through Australia Post each day, this seems like nothing. Was most likely just really, really, badly packaged.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had badly packaged things arrive. I think it has to be a special kind of obvious for it to be picked up.

    SR is WAY safer for drug acquisitions than the dodgy fucking cunts who we buy them from here . Anybody want a local eccy ? pass.... (we joke that you spend 30 bucks to make yourself feel sick and then even worse for the entirity of the next day)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Their arguments against SR are nothing more than the protection of kick back payments made to cops / politicians and gangland figures.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I sit here in my office laughing like Mr Burns watching the painter struggling to hold onto the ledge at authorities flailing with SR. It is perfect. It must really suck to lose a portion of your kick backs to people selling quality drugs out of your jurisdiction. It really is a beautiful thing. 830 interceptions. I am guessing 16000 have come through...

      The tablets, imprinted with the Louis Vuitton symbol, are suspected to have been involved in a 22-year-old man's death after a Brisbane house party last weekend.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Several of his friends also ended up in hospital after taking the same drugs, with emergency department staff confirming a spike in ecstasy overdoses.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Users who have checked the tablets with home testing kits claim they contain the drug PMA (para-methoxyamphetamine), which has markedly different effects to ecstasy and can be lethal in high doses.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Compounding the danger, there are believed to be two Louis Vuitton batches - one induces standard ecstasy effects, while another looks almost identical but is the one believed to contain PMA and is highly toxic.

     This kid wouldn't be dead today if he managed to sneak a gram or two from NL through customs, instead of buying these pills from 'the street'. The blood is on the hands of politicians and the LE who blindly follow orders like sheep regardless of the damage done to innocent people.

    Should of gone to a legit domestic vendor... They should be telling kids if they're going to buy drugs. Buy off SR vendors who import the real shit and have feedback and reports on the quality of the product. Not some shady character with mystery pills.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dealers should start using SR as a reference to quality, legit products when they're slinging on the street to rands. But still would you trust a stranger?

    That is very interesting. So on the off chance you package is intercepted, you have a 0.48% chance of getting charged. Holy fuck.

    830 is more than I imagined.. but police do have a way of inflating their figures.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only problem with SR is that the bikies get hold of it and start importing to sustain their own businesse... lets face it bikies are stupid and I would not be surprised if they see an opportunity here.. which spoils it for the folk who don't want to onsell it. ALl they want to do is just have a safe way of taking something without having to resort to the risk of buying it off the streets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My other problmm here is WA police are thugs I hear.. so expect some thuggery to occur and useless raids..

    There is. No way. They could. Possibly. Know that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is no way to determine if a hidden service is in country X (save if you manage to deanonymize it of course).

    If there is no way to determine if a hidden service is in country X, then if follows that you cannot possibly say you

    know for sure that it is not inside your territory.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean, I'm ok with NIMBYism per se, but the irrationality of it is annoying. A hidden service is just as likely to be
    <br/>
    situated in the same country as the person who set it up, as a completely different country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh yeah, and you bet your life that that 800+ number factors in all the "illegal steroids" they found. They always
    <br/>
    do that to boost the numbers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want a true picture of what is going on, read the AFP's annual reports, they are freely available on the web.

    The vast majority of intercepts are very large deliveries indeed e.g. &gt; 1kg.

    What other online website sells those drugs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, he may be referring to internet online pharmacies in the case of acquiring steroids, but he mentions illegal drugs only in this report. We don't need him to say SR in order to read between the lines, in fact it'd be somewhat of a shock if a LE agency mentioned SR explicitly externally because they don't want to give free advertising. I know a number of sites in the public scene that sell those drugs, but it's hard to think of any that do so on clearnet unless you are talking about certain mediums that don't exactly support the activity e.g. Topix.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Actually it blows my mind that Topix still exists after all these years. All those transactions can't be all LEO surely, yet there is zero moderation. If LE try to take down SR but leave Topix up it would be the height of hypocrisy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway as per LE propaganda, they don't lie in their reports, they just use selective reporting, dramatics, hyper inflated numbers, nothing that can directly come back and bite them in the ass. From a certain narrow point of view, the report is true.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But the impression is misleading, as was intended. Emphasizing how ZOMG black helicopters important their role is in society in general, is something all LE agencies do to obtain more funding, because more funding implies another wave of troop hiring, which implies promotions and thus higher pay for somebody (s) else in the org. Which is why the authors of these information-free reports never get rapped on the knuckles from on high. This is not how a corporation works, but this is how a government department works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another good example (but much worse on the ethical scale), is the conflation of SR and child pornography just because they are both on the Tor network. Actually there's more child porn on the clearnet than the darknet, but that's an issue for another day. I don't see Amazon.com or Ebay.com being hounded over this in the media either, but it'd be just as logical. In any case, when you examine these reports, few of them lie about it outright e.g. the BBC report on SR, but some of them do e.g. The OZ guy, the herald or something, who is clearly a LE shill or some civilian who thinks he's helping. The point is that when 9/10 people read these reports, they unconsciously infer, incorrectly, that SR supports child pornography, which is something it does not, and never has done. This is the kind of thing they teach you to "catch" in journalism school or even English classes in high school.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think LE sometimes imagine how badly such a campaign could backfire. Contrary to what kmfkewm said on the topic once or twice, the creation and distribution of illegal pornography is actually a highly lucrative business, the phrase 'obscene profits' could hardly be more apt. What if we become so tarred and feathered by the propaganda that we just throw in the towel and start doing exactly what they were implying we were doing? We ain't going to do that, but some other sites might.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Back on topic, I am pretty darn sure that he is referring to SR, as I said he's being deliberately vague.

    People expect certain things from their country's police forces.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is such a huge gap between your, pine's, understanding of the internet, cryptography and the security measures taken by SR (i.e. Tor) and Joe Q. Blow's understanding of the same that you could drive a fucking tanker truck through it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People don't get things like Tor. If "Cmd-Shallies" were to tell the press the truth, namely: "we have no means to identify whether SR is hosted in a datacenter in Virginia, a stone's throw from the CIA's Langley headquarters or run by the Chief Police Comissioner's grandson in Melbourne" then their message of "don't buy drugs online, we are gonna catch you!" is far less effective dontcha think?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    More importantly, public confidence in "the state" falls and they can hardly have that.

     There is. No way. They could. Possibly. Know that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There is no way to determine if a hidden service is in country X (save if you manage to deanonymize it of course).

     If there is no way to determine if a hidden service is in country X, then if follows that you cannot possibly say you

     know for sure that it is not inside your territory.

      This is what I cannot understand. I quite literally cannot comprehend how he arrives at these conclusions.

    Ah crap, you're right. I got the article quote in the OP confused with this one: http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/07/melbourne-man-arrested-after-allegedly-importing-drugs-via-silk-road/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The better-than-thou tone that the writer takes, probably making no connection between his subject matter and the two large coffees he's had for breakfast makes me roll my eyes and more upsettingly, smash something on my desk.

    You see kids, it's alright altering your mental state *as long as it's not with arbitrarily-illegal* drugs. Luke Hopewell, I'd hope that you will consider this when you're picking up your wife's Ambien tomorrow at the pharmacy but that's probably hoping too much.

    Pine how exactly does a hidden service work so that it cant be traced? is it just bounced from server to server constantly or something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway the fact we and topix are still up just goes to prove my theory they really actually dont give a fuck about us seeming we only make up like 0.0000001% of all internatiional drug trade.
