    Hi PPL, im from Ger and new at SR, i want to buy some Hash (not many 10G +-).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My Question, Have someone experience with "Packstation's" ( So called in Ger, u can send Stuff to it and you have 9 Days time to get it , 24 HR's ) Maybe some Germans here who can Help me?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I cant deliver to my Home Adress ( cuz GF ).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Problem is, Packstation Slots are registered to my Name ( no prob ) , but im the Only person who can open it to take it , with PIN and mTan.
    <br/>
    At Home Adress i can say , " I didnt order, dont know nothing bout it" . At Packstation , nobody will send me drugs cuz they cant take it,  except some ppl that maybe hate me and hope i got pwned by the police...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe some other Countries have experience with it too, its like Private Boxes at your Post/Mail Office ( i think )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    meh , hope u know what i mean, not the best english i know.
    <br/>

    What exactly is your question?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the looks of it you're pointing out that Germany has things referred to here in the US as PO boxes.. congratulations. Big tip I have for you is get normal mailed to your PO box or packstation. If you get normal mail AND sr mail it looks normal. If you just go to your packstation to pick up strictly drugs you order from SR your chance of getting caught will go up significantly!

    If its a local drop, i dont see the problem. Why would your GF freak out if something is delivered to you?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the end its just mail so try it, get something small delivered first and see how that goes.

    All done, no problems, maybe a bit longer shipping time 2-3 Days in Domestic ( GER -&gt; GER ), be sure to ask the vendor if he can send as a "Maxi Brief" , Small letters are not accepted in Packstation's.
    <br/>
    Oh and ofc , if u want to buy Worldwide or EU Wide , i dont recommend Packstation's, but Domestic should be safe enough. ( Stealthy package )
