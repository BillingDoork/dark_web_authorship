    Ive been trying to figure out a way to safely receive my mail...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would it be effective to just rent the largest PO Box with my real information, so all my packages can fit in there... that way if a package ever were caught, they wouldn't be able to confront me directly about it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a package were caught they would try to get me to sign for it, right? Meaning as long as I simply pick up mail from the box, say at night, (there's no cameras at this place), then I should be alright? How would they go about busting me from a package they caught being sent to my Po Box if they could never confront me about it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would they go to my house, or try to get a warrant there? (I keep nothing at my house)... but I still don't want cops searching through and wrecking my house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't want to use a Fake ID to open a postal box.... In what way could they try to bust me for a detected package that got sent to my box? If I only picked up the packages at night?

    Never attempt to open a PO box with a fake identity. Can cause you more trouble than getting caught receiving drugs in the mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Non-USPS PO boxes are the best. They are usually run by mom 'n pop types who will go out of their way to be helpful but for the most part respect your mail and privacy and won't get into your business unless there is a really good reason to. A large box is better because you don't have to interact with the employees everytime you pick something up but they can be kind of expensive. Also, a legitimate business name connected to the box helps because you never actually have to have your name on the shipment and receiving lots of packages is not out of the ordinary. Of course they will have your real name and address, so be careful who you deal with. If the cops ever got involved they would come straight to your door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The best part is they will sign for you anything that requires a signature and not require you to sign to pick it up (in my experience.) Also, unless you are receiving kilos of coke or heroin or something big time, the chances they would sit and wait for you to come pick it up are slim.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I love my private PO box and I won't give it up until the day (crossing fingers) it gets flagged. But then I will just move on to another facility with a different address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have a great day!

    Also have some legitimate mail and packages sent there if possible. You want it to look like you just need a PO box, not a secret drug collection box.

    This is my only qualm with this method. Everything else you mentioned is obviously safer, but how could you possibly know if a CD were coming? To think LE absolutely would not stake the place out is ridiculous, I'm sure they would for a few days at least if they really wanted to. So then, you're fucked, walk right into their hands. And then you're in even more trouble for falsifying documents or whatever the charge might be, and it also admits very much more guilt. There's no way you weren't expecting the package if it goes to your particular PO box that matches up with your fake ID. At least at a household address you can feign ignorance, and also be able to tell if the package has been tampered with, instead of showing up at the PO box with no prior knowledge and no time to dispose of anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another poster mentioned the legit or phony business name idea as a second person/business receiving mail in your box. He said if anything did happen, he planned to claim he was sharing the box with an imaginary friend who was starting up a small business in the area, and the bastard was obviously using his buddies POB for illicit deliveriesÂ  &gt;:( what a jerk! But he wouldn't be obligated to give the imaginary guy up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically, POB is a lot safer in every way, until you DO get caught, then you're fucked 10x harder. Also, oxyhoot mentioned they'd sign off on packages for you, might be a stupid question but that doesn't matter, right...? Or would it be considered that you HAVE received the package, just the same as signing off at home under your name (where at least you can refuse it). Maybe you'd have to sign for the employee when you'd pick it up? Honest question, I'm not all that familiar with POB's.

    Are you ordering large amounts or just personal? If it's just personal then opening it with your real identity is your safest bet because you have complete plausible deniability. This is how it works from what I've read (should not be taken as fact though). Basically, someone sends you illegal substances to your P.O. box, if it makes it through (which it most likely will especially if it's domestic) then you'll just go to your P.O. box and pick it up and if it's bigger than your box they'll usually leave you a slip and you pick it up at the front desk. If your package filled with illegal substances gets intercepted (normally only happens with international orders, not domestic) then three things usually happen:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) LE goes investigate and normally get your address (the one you registered to get the box) from the owner and then head over to that address to find you and question you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) (Normally only big orders or orders LE find interest in) They'll stake out the business and wait for you to pick up the marked package and then follow you to wherever you go, that's enough probable cause to allow them to kick down your door and search your place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3) (Normally only small orders) They'll confiscate your package and usually will send you a letter notifying it was confiscated though a lot of people are reporting that they're not even receiving letters anymore or any type of notification for that matter. This is when you stop ordering illegal things and move on to the next business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're buying large amounts then I suggest getting two forms of fake identification and opening a large P.O. box at a 24/7 mail center. That way you can go pick up your packages at random hours and most likely LE won't be staking out your place. If you're really paranoid you can wait an extra 7 days to pick up your package and surely by then they'll stop staking your place because at that point it's expensive so you better be worth the investment.

    Damn, scary shit... Do you think that's because they discovered there were multiple packages going through the local post office to multiple people, implying a whole operation and distribution? Or were even the individual packages still pretty big? Or were they more like personal amounts and they just targeted individuals while unaware of the whole situation?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't mind me asking, that is. It's cool if you'd rather not say, that just made me kinda paranoid is all haha.

    Mostly copied/pasted from a another post I made elsewhere:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously, the PO will know your real identity when you get the box, but also register your box with a fake business name. I did this and mail is deliverable to both my name and the business name. As is well-known, packages addressed to a business name are much less suspicious and less likely to be screened. Since most sellers use fake business names too, it looks like a business-to-business package, so that's even better. I use a technology-sounding company name, so if anyone asks, I have a side business of repairing phones and ipods that people are shipping to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even the smallest, cheapest PO box is more than big enough to fit an 8th of weed (at least at my PO), so they will just leave it in there instead of putting a slip in and making you pickup at the customer service desk. Though a few times I did get the slip with bigger packages and I was a nervous nelly going to the counter to pick it up, but it always went just fine. Never had to sign or anything like that.
