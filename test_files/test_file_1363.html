    I'll be ordering a 5 strip or 10 strip of LSD from EU and for an extra 6$ I can get tracking. Well, the money is totally worth it to me if I can actually see where it is and what happens to it so I don't have to worry and wonder.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I've heard that all tracking requires a signature and may be looked at more closely. I'm not worried at all about how long it takes to get to me, I just want to know that it WILL get to me. In your experience, does tracking help a person to not worry, or is that extra involvement an unjustified risk?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Tracking is important if you're a vendor.Â  If you're a buyer ordering internationally I'd just skip it: personally I think its nearly useless. I've had packages delivered even when tracking showed them as still in transit &amp; watching something enter a sorting facility and then sit there for four days is not a good use of anyone's time. Plus it's hard to resist the temptation to keep checking &amp; checking &amp; checking. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is just my opinion - I'm sure others might think differently! But if I were you I'd skip the tracking. Sometimes it even makes the worry &amp; wondering worse:

    EU-&gt;USA I would highly recommend tracking, especially if you are a buyer, that is if you care about your money. If your order gets lost and there is no tracking, good luck getting the vendor to settle with a refund/reship, as there will be no proof you didn't receive it. So basically you can lose $6 for tracking, or you can lose $70-$100+ in your order in the case of a mishap, which I have had from EU-&gt;USA, most specifically UK-&gt;USA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tracking on packages will not be 'looked at' any more suspiciously than any other package. The only thing that will get your package looked at is it looking suspicious and your vendor being very crappy with his packaging. It's one of the reasons I only use vendors that have a few months of experience, or if the vendors tell me exactly how good their stealth is.

    I'm not sure where this even came from, but using real details (I assume you mean name and address) is important in receiving your package. I found the best way to do business on here is use legitimate details, but only with vendors you 100% trust. Ideally, domestic only.

    if its a long time reliable vendor tracking isn't necessary. also another bonus you can save a few bucks in the process.

    If you are going to order 5-10 blotters then I would say it doesn't worth it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plus as other said it might raise the anxiety :)
