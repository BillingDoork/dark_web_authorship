    Any clever ways to start getting junk mail to a newly acquired PO box?  I figured that would help blend the packs, etc received to that drop.

    What a first world problem to have  ;)

    Just register for information from various companies and businesses, I am sure your PO box will be inundated in no time.

    Go to any busy Post Office that services a large number of box rentals.  Most of them have a table or two where people often stop and go through the mail they've just picked up.  At thew end of these tables are usually large trash cans where people discard unwanted mail.  You'll find tons of other people's junk mail as well as magazines/periodicals, retail catalogs, etc.  Inside most of these magazines you'll find a tear out form used to subscribe.

    There's a few ways, 1st off sign up for dumb shit online with slight mispellings of your name, for example if you were (for example sake a girl named Erica Powell) you could sign up for obvious dumb offers and do online "surveys" with names like Erika Powell or Erica Powel, Ericka Powel, and so on...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And another way, is actually a service I am just rolling out in the Services and/or Packaging section on SR... For a small price I can send very official looking mail with various legitimate corporate logos, USPS bulk mail barcocding, metered postage, etc etc, as well as dumby or decoy letters and packages. It will be up to the customer which they want sent at various affordable rates. Check this out:

    As well as signing up for Free Samples online...

    Religious magazines, sign up at three local churches, coupons, sign up for deals and newsletters from major corporations, fill out contest forms and you'll get unsolicited mail and maybe some prizes. Try to do more online shopping, Amazom.com a few hundred bucks a month, request information about the military, subscribe to a cheese of the month club, I knew a guy who actually mailed stuff to his own P.O. Box to keep it busy. There are many possibilities.
