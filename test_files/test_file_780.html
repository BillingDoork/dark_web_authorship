    As a new vendor we took shipping to be the most important of all issues.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With much advice and research we developed a creative way to insure that our Premium Cannabis would make it to our clients. Here's what they had to say after receiving our package. Keep in mind these are the first four packages we've sent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Recent Customer Reviews-
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "everything from the smart (on several levels) labeling - way beyond just what's necessary to be inconspicuous - to the packaging, I kept getting surprised. I wish I could go into detail so I could explain WHY this packaging is such a good idea"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I was blown away with how smart the stealth is , and you're right about it being smart on so many levels, it kept getting smarter lol.
    <br/>
    Smart is the keyword here lol."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I've never seen so stealth packaging. I knew it was my sample but i was second guessing myself the whole time. Until finally the mylar pack labeled chem and stink appeared. Amazing Stealth."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Bud was Amazing!
    <br/>
    The stealth was Absolutely Stealthy!
    <br/>
    You now have the #1 Stealth Packaging on SR!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Oh, and best stealth I've seen, truly legit. Thank you, LTC."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Very clever work here by LTC so that even if the package was ever opened, accidentally or intentionally, the person opening the package would never think that the contents inside are what they are. This sets a new standard for best SR stealth that I've ever seen."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have ANY CONCERNS about packaging and stealth than contact Lionware today.
