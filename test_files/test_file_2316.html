    Tried searching but the overall results were lackluster. I wanted to get some information on becoming a vendor. I've never sent mail that wasn't hand labeled, 1 stamp, and sent in a white envelope. So explain it like I'm 5! :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Questions:
    <br/>
    1) Standard USPS Priority Mail/Express box/envelope sizes (for small orders)? Order directly from USPS website or go into a local branch?
    <br/>
    2) Labels - Where to buy? What kind of printer/paper do you need? Software?
    <br/>
    3) Stamps - How many do you need?
    <br/>
    4) If using tracking how does that change the number of stamps you need? Pay for it in store to avoid leaving traces? Tracking always requires signature (domestic)?
    <br/>
    5) Vacuum Sealer and related items? Looking for suggestions here on brand (FoodSaver?)... Clear or solid silver color? Buy on Amazon or locally?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything else I'm forgetting please let me know. As you can see I am clueless but appreciate all your advice.

    If you need to be told this then perhaps this isn't for you. This is basic info that most work out for themselves becoming a vendor, either that or you could be fishing.

    I'm definitely not fishing. It sounds stupid but most Gen Y folks growing up with online bill pay and what not have never had a reason to send anything through the post that wasn't perhaps a check for a bill. I already have answers for my questions I was mostly looking for validation. Anyway, thanks for the input.

    It's going to depend on what you're selling, and the volume you expect to be dealing with. There are no general methods except for not using the return address of your house, and being a courteous professional to your customers.

    For example small quantities of pills or powder/crystal substances. I think the latter would be fine in a regular envelope if it can be wrapped up and concealed nicely (like in between a greeting card). The former I'm not sure. Seems to me like you'd want to use something a little thicker than a regular envelope (priority box) with a bunch more padding and what not to prevent pills from chipping and breaking. Appreciate the advice!

    Greetings cards get stolen by postmen looking for cash, so not a good idea to use them.
