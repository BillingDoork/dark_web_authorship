    RM are a bit slow over the weekend. I've ordered Fri before and its come Wed (or thur) if I can remember so try not to panic too much. If it makes you feel better, run erasure on your computer to remove all traces of TSR including browser history, tor client etc if ur using windows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly though you should be fine - remember not all sales are necessarily "in transit" when vendors say they are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lots of people have had failed deliveries before (1 in 20 say) and nothings happened, not even a Love letter
    <br/>
    <br/>
    tl;dr you should be fine.

    Not here either, im quite pissed off. First order never turned up and now this one is taking ages.. I really hate rm, can anyone else experiencing delays (3+ business days for uk domestic) comment as well so we can get an idea about this situation and whether or not they are intercepting specifically ivory packages.

    Have a massive UK delay here as well. Ordered on last Sunday, sent out Monday, and still nothing. Vendor has immaculate feedback, and excellent communication, so I'm sure it's to do with RM. I guess it's possible that there was a serious fuck up in some sorting office, a whole batch of stuff got delayed, and now that all that mail has missed its target delivery times, it's gone to the back of the queue as their stupid system means that more recent mail will take priority.

    I can confirm that areas around London have been deeply affected by the RM backlog (which they are trying to deny exists).. orders from 2-3 weeks ago are still coming in. Less post than previously as well.. Part time RM staff are taking orders.. It is very annoying I can imagine but things will get fixed by the end of the week if not start of next, or at least I hope so haha. i am also waiting for some domestic orders..

    Which vendor are you waiting on. At least if we can establish that there was an issue in a particular locale, then it would help that we know something is up and it's not just random.

    Was from ivory as well which was in transit on the 10th. Though I have had a order from phase put in transit  on the 3rd arrived 14th. So I don't know when the delays have started or I was lucky. also I'm from the southern hemisphere.

    Very strange with Ivory, I had an order show from him and one that didn't (and I am UK - domestic).. might be guys intercepting his packages where he lives or just a massive postal problem.. either way if it's that long it must be a lost cause.

    I think so as well, London has been acting very weird to me. Some orders from abroad would show up before

    tuesday will be 3 weeks since my order from NBOME was marked in transit.  he hasn't been active on SR lately either and has no more listings.
    <br/>

    he has good feedback so im hoping its just the lag, but 3 weeks is the longest  ive ever waiting for an order.
