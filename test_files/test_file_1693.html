    What's the best way to ship glass equipment? I understand beakers are probably easy to ship but what about the more delicate glassware with small parts such as sep funnels and vials with narrow necks?

    first off i would label its as if it came from a legit chemical company. not making it obvious what it is but make it to where if it was to be searched and found out they would think it came from a legit company. i would say the best way to do it would be to pack it with Styrofoam than wrap it in bubble wrap.

    Read Strike's 'Sources'. It's the gold standard for black market chemistry materials research even if it's old.

    What we did is get polystyrene molds done and then you can remake casing for your equipment over and over again or you can contact a packaging company that makes them to specification and give them the mold dimensions. This is by far the best way to ensure your glassware doesn't break.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly if you are transporting stuff like reactors/centrifuges and you are doing it by a shipping company like UPS/Fedex (only do this if you can't get a van) you need to set up a company that claims to sell that sort of shit and get send them to your new location with bent invoices/receipts blah blah to go with the shipping order. You need to keep the boxes in pristine condition or keep having them remade so you can pass that off as brand-spanker or at least second hand. What is also a must if you are shipping with them is that you ship them from a unit and not a domestic location like a house. It has to be from a unit otherwise it can raise questions.

    I hope this helps. :)
