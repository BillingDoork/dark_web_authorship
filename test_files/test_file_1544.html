    hi never had this happen before so I got a question
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I made 3 orders lately and today I got a Delivery Notice in the mail and it says to pick it up at some convenience store tomorrow
    <br/>
    <br/>
    why didn't they just put it in my mail box like usual? should I go and pick it up?

    In canada, do you guys normally pick up your mail at a convenience store? Does said convenience store have a post office (I know there are some USPS at gas stations in the US)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The box was maybe too big for your mail box or the multiple boxes all could not fit in and thus gave u a notice to come pick them up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other plausible explanation would be that they want to arrest you. Are these package personal or business?

    thanks

    they are orders from SR vendors..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one of them was express and I think that's the one that didn't fit the mailbox (but it did fit last time, he just bent it in half)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the other 2 orders are in envelopes and should have no problem
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think I will call the store in a few hours and see if I can come get my package tonight (even though it says to pickup tomorrow after 1pm on the slip)
