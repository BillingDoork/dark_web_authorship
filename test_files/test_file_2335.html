    So before the Olympics i was receiving 4-5 packs a month for about 8 months to various addresses under different names. In the first week of the Olympics i lost 4, i then had dummy packs sent with nothing in them of which only half arrived (customs approved). Since then i stopped ordering till after Para Olympics and in the week after that i lost another 2.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I never use an address after i lose mail to it except for the dummy parcels and all the missing mail came from Holland. Had sellers change the envelopes and all packaging was very discreet (vacuum, padded, average envelopes).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I'm wondering have i had an unusual run of bad luck or has UK customs stepped up their game? Because right now I have only a couple addresses left to use before i can not get any mail again so if its bad luck I will wait a month or two and go back to smaller orders. But if this is happening to others as well then I guess I should switch to UK vendors which I'm not a fan off for the quality of products I am seeking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let me know if your missing parcel rate has gone up or if things have stayed the same for you since Olympics.

    Were they all from the same UK vendor?

    No, all from the same Dutch vendor. The last two parcels were small free re-sends, to see if any mail gets through so that we could resume larger orders. The first 4 was one large order split up.
