    Hi everyone,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a package stuck at customs for approx 4 days.
    <br/>
    Is it safe to assume that it's been taken? or could it
    <br/>
    be that their backlogged from easter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not looking for answers just people that have had similar experiences.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers

    You're fine at 4 days, I used to get mail from eastern Europe to the US and it would sit at customs for a week usually. As b0lixtrader said sometimes they can take 30 days without ever flagging your package or anything. Customs is just a big bottleneck for mail coming into the country and it can take awhile for things to be sorted.

    I have the same issue. I receive packages from china all the time usually it clears within 1-2 days. I've had many packages that have taken longer that were then sent to me and some that were returned to sender never seized. But I know that if something is in customs longer than a couple days it is being scrutinized.
