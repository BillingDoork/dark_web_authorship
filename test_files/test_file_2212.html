    It is recommended that you not use Tor while checking your package tracking.  The main reason is that is it reasonably easy for USPS to identify someone checking tracking who is using Tor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thinking is that they could then flag those items for further checks.

    While this could just be paranoia, better safe then sorry.

    Packages always sit in customs over the weekends.  I wouldn't trip about it until it's been in there for 5-7 days in holding.  This means they're doing some tests on it and you need to clean house.  What chem is it if you don't mind me asking?  if it's a small amount of product (like a couple grams) then don't trip you'll probably get a love letter but I'd still clean house (aka put the computer somewhere else turn off internet clean out any drugs, and cut your hair if you're a hippie.)  HLS usually deals with all international orders right now since there really isn't too much terrorist action going on... And they're much smarter "technology wise" then dea.  I wish you the best of luck let us know how it goes!

    They're not going to kick in your door for 10g's.  You will probably get a love letter if anything but as you said it's been in since friday I've had packages sit for 5 days and still make it and the package was un molested :P

    On a side note I'll have domestic USA moonrocks in 2 weeks so you won't have to deal with no customs  ;)

    Just make sure your receiver isn't going to rat you out and keep his cool cause if it's under a fake then they won't even attempt to arrest him... Unless he rats the both of you out.

    I wonder if it's just detecting the tor proxy/privoxy.

    <br/>
    Regardless when I check dcn's I'm using a custom proxy with macchanger on someone elses connection miles away from where I'm located.  Works like a charm :P
