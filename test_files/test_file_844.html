    Just wondering how that works, does the package get logged into the system as being from the nearest sort facility or do they actually log that its from the shop?

    It can probably be traced back to the shop, but I don't think the shop's address would appear on the online tracking info, if that's what you're asking.

    More interested in how they trace it. If i understand this correctly, when you pay the shop for shipping they in turn pay the postal service, which then connects the package to the shop. Is it then only the monetary connection that exists, or does the shipping information usps receive include the shop?

    Those stores don't use stamps, they use prepaid printed postage. When shipping this way, USPS has a database of your CC transaction, your name and address and phone # associated with that card, the store you shipped it from, and what time you were in there. Law enforcement would even know which time of day to look for the incident on the security tapes.
