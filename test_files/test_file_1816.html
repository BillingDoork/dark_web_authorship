    Hello Silkroad Community,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    first off all I have to say that I like Silk Road very much! The system is intelligent, fair and safe. I like the different kinds of vendors, more vendors means bigger offering :)
    <br/>
    I am first time user now and just ordered an Oz of the "SwaziRed" from "SwaziBudBud888" with registred mail.
    <br/>
    I read that he wants first time users to finilaze early, so I did. The shipping status is shipped.
    <br/>
    How did I get my tracking ID now?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope there are some baked people who can help me :D
    <br/>

    I went to the seller's profile where he/she has their FAQ's for buyers....it states somewhere down in all that text:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *Registered/tracked mail is extra and it requires a signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, depending on what you paid for (non-traceable package are FREE for shipping) is what you will get.  If you didn't pay extra for the traceable package, then you will just have to wait.  And it seems it might take a bit too, assuming you don't live in South Africa, where they ship from.  Anywhere from "8 to 23 days" according to the seller's page.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The seller is well known, and has excellent feedback here, so you shouldn't have a problem with this.  It might just take a while to get to you, up to 3 weeks if you're in the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace

    Send the vendor a message, and I would highly recommend providing him with your PGP so he can reply to you securely with the tracking #

    Best of luck!
