    3 weeks is a long time to wait..if you have a tracking number then surely you can find where it is?
    <br/>
    But sounds like its been taken. Just ring postal service and quote the number and ask them where it is.

    Be careful inquiring about the package or physically going to the post office to grab it. From what I hear this can greatly reduce plausible deniability(your ability to believably declare that you don't know what the fuck that is or who sent it) if the package ends up getting seized. After all, you DON"T know what it is or who sent it right? ;)

    The tracking information is basically stating that your post office has it on file that you have moved and didn't leave a forwarding address - not that the package was moved.  They will hold on to the package for up to 30 days.  Have you had any other trouble receiving mail?  If not, I would advise you to be very wary of this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do want to try and find out what is going on just call the post office and let them know you have not been receiving a lot of your mail.  Don't even mention the word package.  Play as dumb as you can.  Depending on their response, well just try and read between the lines.  If they immediately say "Oh, we have a package for you here!" do not go pick it up.  Just tell them you don't receive packages to that address but that you would still like to have them look into why you aren't receiving regular mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Forwarding addresses is handled by the mail carrier, and they frequently screw things up, so it could be an honest mistake.  Try and gauge what they tell you and just use your best judgement.  Remember, it is Christmas time, they have way too much on their plates to worry about small time shit unless the package was somehow torn open in transit.  Be careful!

    I just re-read your post and realized you said PO Box.  The dipshits at the post office probably thought it was going to the previous box renter.  But my original advice still holds true, tell them you haven't received some things to your new box you just opened.  This is (hopefully) a case of a clerk being an idiot.
