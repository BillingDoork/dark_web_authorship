    I know nothing about stealth packaging, and not much about much else, but I do know that you should probably request to get a PM if anyone can give you any tips

    I think the best piece of forum advice on stealth packaging is from Shroomeister on the 'So you want to be an SR vendor, Here is some of what you need to know' thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39346.0

     3)Packaging: I have yet to see any vendor here tell a "I-want-to-be-a-new-vendor" guy exactly how to package. Most people recommend buying something off of an established vendor and see how they do it. Find a vendor with a bunch of good feedback,a vendor maybe vending the same thing you want to, and buy from them.
     <br/>
     That is what I was told when I got here. I didn't do that because I had already acquired a level of stealth locally and I only had to figure out a few things (the USPS system mostly) to begin vending here.
     <br/>
     What I recommend (if you do not  buy from an established vendor) is to "practice" your shipping. Sure you are going to have to spend a few more dollars. Mock up your shipping method. Decide "how" you are going to ship. First class, priority, express. whatever. Know what it is going to cost to ship via that method. Know what kind of supplies you are going to need. Packing tape, package labels, etc. Know where you are going to get them from. Are you going to mail first class and buy bubble wrap and brown boxes from Uline, or do you only want to send packages express (overnight mail) and then you get to use the free USPS envelopes and boxes. Send  a couple package with "inert" contents via the method you are testing. Does it get there? If not, why not? What does the DCN say? You did use a DCN right? Next send a package or 2 with your real contents. Same deal. Did it get there? No?, why not? What does the DCN say?
     <br/>
     Package correctly. If I were to shake your package, does it rattle? Is one side strangely heavier then the other. Does it feel like there is nothing in there? Do the contents "shift around" if the package it tilted. Not all of these are bad things. You need to know which ones are.
     <br/>

    For anything more in-depth you'll need to discuss it via pm with a willing vendor as I don't think any will be willing to give up their trade secrets publicly (rightly so!), or better still purchase the product you intend to sell from an established vendor (using a buyer account not the account you intend to vend on) to see how they do it first hand, all the best of luck to you :)

    Some vendors offer start up advice for new vendors, albeit for a fee if you get stuck. All the info you need is on here though for free, will just take you some time to find it all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.

    Get a vendors account ASAP. Look around these forums for people that are well known and respected for reviewing the drug that you are supplying, and send them a small sample. Most of these guys have received dozens of packages and have seen incredible stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most of them won't share the stealth methods here openly, but they would probably tell you privately if you prove yourself to them.

    Please get your vendor account opened before posting further requesting packaging information, please exercise caution in sending the OP details until their credentials are authenticated.
