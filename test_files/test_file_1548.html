    You mean a delivery confirmation number from the USPS?  USPS stresses that's not actually a tracking number, per se, and in my experience it's often off by a day.  Actual tracking numbers from FedEx and other couriers are usually pretty accurate, though.

    It depends on what website you are using. I saw a link posted on the forums that could be safely accessed via TOR and it was off by a day or more or movement.  I went USPS website via clearnet and it was accurate. Often you won't get but 1-2 updates each day (as in 1. processed in X sort facility and 2. out for delivery) but it is updated fairly regularly in my experience.  It is not up to the minute but each day should give you some indication of progress.

    Yes the delivery date is accurate no matter if using USPS, FedEx, or UPS. Notice I say delivery date. That means the date your item was actually delivered. No company or the USPS can offer you a 100% accurate time frame of delivery. In fact even if you pay for nextday air from USPS they dont guarantee you will have it in 1 day or even a week. The only for sure thing is that you paid for next day air.

    Isn't that just bullshit? It's their rules though, not much one can do.
    <br/>
    I imagine they get most packages delivered as estimated though.
