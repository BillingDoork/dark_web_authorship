    I once waited over 20 days. I wasn't in a rush so I just chilled out and it came eventually. Didn't need to send him a message or anything.

    <br/>
    Depends how impatient you are or how much you need the stuff what you do. Eventually you'll get the option to contact the seller when it hasn't arrived and he'll give you an action plan then, whether to hold tight or reship or refund.

    NL ----&gt; UK is a tricky business. They watch those packages pretty closely. know quite a few mates that have had packages seized and love letters sent. even on very small 'envelope' letters with a simple pill or two inside.

    NL to UK isn't risky business unless it's poor packaging or red flag packaging (handwritten,etc) I've received 3 figure sum of pills in one envelope before and probably 4 figure sum in total from NL with no problems ;)

    Was just panicking this time round because it took 3 times longer than usual!

    Had one that took almost 20 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Was no more on the tracking information.
    <br/>
    When I called, they said, nah, it never land in the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then I finaly got it :)

    Sick story, such stress for nuts.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think that, seizing ilicit good to actualy burn it, doesn't make money at all.
    <br/>
    So why would they pay more people to check, if they don't get anything in return ^^
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All is matter of business and money. It's a free high way for everything !!! If it looks like a document, it won't be checked.
    <br/>
    If you have a fake bill on it, with a totally legit good, like amazon (the one that will use amazon printed carton package ^^ will pass through all borders for sure)
    <br/>
    custom won't open it in most case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe I'm wrong :)
