    Here's what I was thinking....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buy Small Flat-Rate boxes, using a thermal printer, print up labels with the addresses on them, slap them on the flat-rate boxes and drop them in the blue boxes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From what I understand the flat rate boxes you just buy at a certain fee, and their rule is, if it fits, it ships... so does that mean once I buy the flat-rate boxes, I can just slap labels on them and drop them in the blue boxes to ship?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ask because I've heard of people putting stamps on the flat-rate boxes, but this seems counter-intuitive since the boxes are like $5+ meaning the shipping cost is included in the box cost.... true? false?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit; I forgot to mention I plan to get the label-400 tracking rolls and use them on my packages, but yeah... would the above work ^?

    I recommend you get the free boxes from a post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then buy $5.60 stamps and $0.20 stamps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The rate is $5.80 and tracking with priority is free.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could put a block of lead in the small priority box with tracking and it would still be $5.80

    So anywhere in the US it will always be 5.80 for the small free boxes? I don't want a package to get returned or not delivered for too little or too much postage.

    Yes, it is a flat rate for the USA

    "The Priority Mail Small Flat Rate Box has a retail shipping price of $5.80 — one price, regardless of weight, up to 70 lbs. for U.S. addresses."

    I was under the impression that you could only put envelopes in the blue boxes.

    Blue boxes have a 13-ounce weight limit. If the box weighs less than 13oz and is paid for (either as a flat rate box you bought or any box with stamps on it), you can just drop it in and forget about it. If you have multiples shipments to make, some people would advise you drive around town using multiple boxes. Hopefully it's cold out so you don't look weird in your gloves.  8)

    For a time I worked as a shipping processor for an online retailer and we dropped A LOT into those blue boxes.

    just buy the prepaid boxes or envelopes whichever you prefer instead of the stamps, that way no one will look if the stamps are correct and they all come with tracking so no need for the labels.

    You can only buy prepaid online as far as I know.  Then it is tied to an account / credit card / address.  Not good.

    There is no weight limit for the blue boxes.  There is a 13oz weight limit for using stamps.  There is no weight limit if you print postage and apply it to a package and drop it in a box.

    It's because you agree that there is nothing hazardous before you print the postage online, and if they find spilling battery acid out of the 16oz package they can tie it to your identity used to pay for the postage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's the whole idea behind it, prepaid can be tracked to who printed the label. Now if you use burner CC and all fake info then you're probably fine.

    I ship LSD and small pills. I will never come close to sending 13oz of warez so I use stamps.
