    I had something marked in transit October 11th  and still has not arrived. I was kind of in the path of Sandy but did not lose power or anything like that.  I have never had an order take over a month to arrive? To me it seems most likely it's not getting here.  It was a larger order(nothing crazy though) from a seller with a good reputation.  Should I hold out hope that it  will arrive or cut my loses and move on? Anybody ever get a package 35 days after it was marked in transit? Thanks in advance!!!

    I am also in the same situation. Order was sent out on Oct 4th and 5th (according to vendor) (split into 2). As of today, still nothing!
    <br/>
    I am also located off East Coast, where Sandy did not affect anything. I have received domestic packages without any trouble.
    <br/>
    I am 41 total days, 27 business days (Oct 8th was Columbus day and Nov 12 was Veterans Day).
    <br/>
    I honestly don't know what to say or think, it has been a very very long time, with ya there.

    Customs barely ever sends love letters (more common for prescription medication)

    I would definitely cut my losses. Ordering to that address should also be held off, maybe send a dummy package?

    Eh, one time I ordered a package from Spain to the US... after 20 days never got it. Told the vendor, he reshipped. 10 days later I got the reship + the original package (same day, it was nuts!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was nice enough to give the vendor money for the reship since I ended up receiving both.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes stuff from Europe can take a while to get to the States. No rhyme or reason, just how it is. With the devastation in the East, i'm sure it could take even longer. And with holidays fast approaching, the wait could border on ridiculous.
