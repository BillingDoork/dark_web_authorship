    I've had one case where the police has showed up because of a seized package. Because of this I really can't take any chances, so I've been keeping to domestic deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've bought the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, and I won't die happy until I get to experience this on acid peak. Unfortunately there are no LSD sellers here in Norway. I'll have to buy it from some other country. I'm considering Sweden because I somehow think it's going to be less suspicious than UK, Netherlands or whatever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm wondering what the chances are, if any, at getting LSD seized? Could it help if I had the vendor send me a book and put it inside there? Could it still be identified through X-ray or something? What could I do to have the most stealth possible?

    I really dont think putting it in a book is going to make a big difference. Communicate with you seller I guess, make sure you are comfortable with his shipping methods before placing your order. I havent placed an order for anything as of yet.. I cant wait though! My homework is almost complete... Good luck!!

    Dude, just have the vendor send you a standard envelope with the return address of a bill collector or any business. Do you really think LE cares to open up your plain white envelope and take a blacklight to your paper, when there are thousands circulating every day? Even if LE has shown up to your door and flagged you in the past, you're not immune to the volume of junk we all get in our boxes.

    A book is large.  There is a much larger volume of small normal envelopes in the post than book sized items.  It's simple receiving an envelope from anywhere in the world including flagged countries.  Why take steps to make your package large and stand out more when there is no problem in having it blend in with envelopes?  Foil would be bad.  That would show on an x-ray.

    I've never had a problem with that.  I've always received it between some type of paper.  It's always been potent and I have never had LSD intercepted.  I wax paper then normal paper would be better but I've never had a problem.

    Unless they have bought lsd from the same sheet the vendor in a face to face transaction before, then how would they compare the potency of the LSD after it was shipped to the potency before it was shipped?  They couldn't...  So you could receive weak tabs and just say "oh shipped fucked it up".  I started receiving LSD in the mail from the Netherlands 9 years ago.  I have never had a bad batch :)  I have never tried the same LSD before shipping either though.

     Unless they have bought lsd from the same sheet the vendor in a face to face transaction before, then how would they compare the potency of the LSD after it was shipped to the potency before it was shipped?  They couldn't...  So you could receive weak tabs and just say "oh shipped fucked it up".  I started receiving LSD in the mail from the Netherlands 9 years ago.  I have never had a bad batch :)  I have never tried the same LSD before shipping either though.

        I've never had a problem with that.  I've always received it between some type of paper.  It's always been potent and I have never had LSD intercepted.  I wax paper then normal paper would be better but I've never had a problem.

    Eh not necessarily, heat and light will degrade it. I'm sure it can get pretty hot on some shipping routes. How much effect does that have? idk

    Heat and moisture I know for sure.  I don't know how much it would affect it either.  Think of it this way though.  How much LSD moved in hot trunks of cars and sat in hot cars from the 60s until now?  Also a lot of LSD comes from the Netherlands nowadays because the lax drug laws over there.  If shipping commonly destroyed LSD then all of this wouldn't have worked for 60 years.  I have never received LSD that wasn't potent though.  Just hope your envelope doesn't get wet or cooked lol.
