    Been digging around the forums but I am still a little confused.  If I'm to receive a small personal amount of drugs from the EU to USA would it be better to have it shipped regular mail or registered mail. I wouldn't have to sign for it because my apartment building has a mail room where they sort the mail out and one of those employees would sign for it so that's not what I am worried about.  Is one method going to be faster then the other? Also is registered mail just going to raise flags in customs?

    Sending mail with delivery confirmation (ie signature) is very expensive from the EU, at least from the Netherlands it costs 25$ or so for an envelope. It depends on what you want to order, but flat business envelopes and good stealth is better than a signature. I think signatures are necessery when the shipments are larger and there is more money at stake.

    i've never sent tracked to the US, and i have had only one shipment not arrive until now.
