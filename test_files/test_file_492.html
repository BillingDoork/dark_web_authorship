    Hey I would just like to get an idea of who uses PO boxes and who uses home address. The reason is I just recently got a LL 3 months ago at my home address and now I dont know where to deliver to. Options are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS PO box
    <br/>
    regular looking street address that goes to a UPS mail box service.
    <br/>
    maybe my old apartment? (prob a bad idea)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was thinkg about doing the first two options but I know I would have to just get them and start getting my mail sent to there for a while before I get anything shady.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What our your guys thoughts and or experiences.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    I don't know for sure, since I haven't ordered yet but I have heard of people getting busted for using PO boxes easier...also I would imagine it would be a red flag to them if you get a PO box simply for a package...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hope it helps, good luck!

    That makes zero sense. You generally rent boxes for six months to twelve months at a time. They wouldn't know you have a po box just to get one package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People with po boxes get packages all the time, it's no different from receiving at your house. There's this weird paranoia about po boxes and how every postal worker somehow has x-ray vision and is half drug dog. They see thousands of packages a day, no one is sitting there at the post office trying to figure out what each package is.

    lots of people i know use PO boxes i have for years and its not unusual to get packages at a PO Box alot of people do for their home business or other legitimate reasons unless a package is suspicious, ie. poorly packaged, stupid return address that looks obviously fake or is leaking making sounds or etc your fine.

    P.O. Box or Rented Mailbox with Fake ID
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -another layer of anonymity
    <br/>
    -disposable
    <br/>
    -much higher consequence if you're caught
    <br/>
    -requires interaction with someone f2f
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Home address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -"plasuible deniability" depending on your laws, location, etc.
    <br/>
    -no f2f transactions
    <br/>
    -hassle free receiving (ideally)
    <br/>
    -not quite "disposable"
    <br/>
    -home is up for investigation or a seizure worst case scenario
    <br/>
    <br/>
    pick your poison.
