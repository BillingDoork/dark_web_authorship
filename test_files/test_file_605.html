    Hello everyone,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Been thinking about possible alternative addresses and something came to mind that I haven't really read about too much on the forums. Some of my friends attend colleges in the US. They have addresses that their parents can send letters/packages/etc. Now typically most college students don't get that much junk mail, at least to their dorm/college address, so I was thinking, if you could find a way to flood your college mailbox with junk mail/catalogs you might be able to slip a SR letter in every once in a while.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bring this up because some of my friends have told me how "careless" or "lax" the mail people are at the colleges. Apparently something like a bubble mailer with a handwritten address wouldn't get a second look.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So just wondering, has anyone ever shipped to your address at a university or institution of education?

    One issue I can think of is that a delivery like that could get your expelled from your college.

    This has been a topic of some debate here on the forum.  I don't have any solid advice to give you unfortunately.  I would recommend using the search function as you will pull up a number of threads discussing this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On another note, I did some traveling and I needed to go to the post office while I was out of town.  The town I was in at the time was DEFINITELY a college town and while I was at the post office on 1 occasion I saw 2 people, college students, who I believe were silk roaders.  1 was getting his mail from a PO box and constantly looking over his shoulder, he paused when I walked by and pretended to be fiddling with the mail that was still in the box.  To test my theory I stopped by the door and started rolling a cigarette.  He, thinking I had left, grabbed his mail and started walking towards the door.  When he saw me standing there he flinched, startled, then averted his head and hurried out to his car.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other guy was trying to ask the clerk about the postage he'd need to mail an item, but refusing to pay for it there when she offered repeatedly.  I don't think either picked up on the other person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could be wrong, but it seemed pretty likely and HIGHLY amusing. :)

    +1 for "just find a good vendor".
    <br/>
    I don't see why it'd be different from any other mailbox. Is it b/c packages would be handled by dorm staff? How is that any worse than it being handled by post office staff?

    A lot of the time, you will see students sorting mail. Most student workers just want to get through their shift at the mail room as quick and as easy as possible.  Also, bubble envelopes and packages over standard letter size you will most likely be required to sign for as they don't fit in the small student mailboxes. I can't tell you how many packages of MXE and Etizolam came through after being signed for back when I was attending school (granted these aren't controlled substances albeit they are somewhat suspicious, little blue pills and powders). One thing to note, I did notice that there were always at least two full time USPS employees working, one at the counter, and one actually inspecting and scanning in anything that wasn't standard letter sized. Just don't get the idea that this makes things easier and you are still at risk for ordering anything illegal through the mail. This is only what I have personally experienced from going to a university and spending lots of time in college towns. If you have any specific questions, I can do my best to answer them.

    I've been living at a very large and prestigious state university for the last 6 months. During this time, I've made around 14 purchases on the silk road and only 2 of them failed to reach me. I believe this was because these 2 orders were made right when I moved in and I hadn't filled in some green information card in my mailbox. Basically, OP, YES you can ship to a college campus without much worry. On the other hand, I am now waiting on an additional 2 orders that are 5 days(compared to the standard 3 days that I'm used to) into the shipping process from west to east coast and I'm getting pretty antsy about them... Will let you know if they end up coming through

    This and also try to order domestic if you are worried. Getting a package from NL to a college would seem a little suspicious to me.

    Had a couple chemicals come to my college mailbox without any problems. One even came from Canada with no fuss. Trust me, the people who sort mail at colleges are generally students who don't give a rat's ass what's in your mail. And to the best of my understanding, college officials cannot legally open your mail, so there shouldn't be a reason for them to find out regardless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll be fine.

    I believe letters would be fine, but typically when you pick up a package you have to write your student id number and sign for it as well. I do agree that most of the people working in the mail room are college students who don't really give a fuck, but there are those nosey douchebags and CA's or RA's lurking around too.
