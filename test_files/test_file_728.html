    I had a pack say departed from Eu at the end of last week. Now it usually takes 3 days to touch down on my side of the pond. Its day 4 and i just now checked the track for the first time and it still says and accepted. processed and then departed. last thing it says is origin post preparing for shipment. Next step should be arrived at customs. Now The thing i am confused is I check with my local site! the local site it came from just says departed. Same time...ect and when you hover over the origin post.... It says received that mail is prepairing shipment.  So. WTF is it in customs yet?
    <br/>
    i mean i know it says it departed the last place but has it? has it arrived here at our cust? damn its day 5 since said it left today given its early in the am yet. but what do you think my SR brothers and sisters? and you know i always give karma for you taking your time to give educated answers:)
    <br/>
    Please let me know keep it 100 done sugar coat it:) ha . I mean there is a million things going threw my head from didnt leave there yet to on my side just not scanned? but i have never not seen it scanned in? I have seen it  not say inbound or out and go right to the next hub but never not say it arrived? I do not like to check it much and just a question with usps you should not ever use tor right&gt; i havent! just wondering well 2 questions hope you can help and ill throw karma for your time just 4 days well today is 5 but its only 3am so? still usually it shows in 3 at latest?
    <br/>
    thanks in advnace

    Is this being sent by a proper courier or by the postal service? Because if it's the latter then you often won't see any tracking updates until after delivery because they don't scan/report at every stage.

    the first,
    <br/>
    I have used it say 3 to 5 times before. and it always shows when it departs their customs and arrives in mine! then shows inbound and then outbound,,,ect, No i have seen it not show one scan. the outbound and only 1 time. one time but never not say when it arrived in out customs.! So this is why i am worried. and it usually takes 2 day 3 has been the longest. Now today is the 5th day  well later today since its only 3am now but i hope to get some more input and catfish+1 i keep my word.
    <br/>
    Anyone else please, vets to experienced noobies. Let me know what you think. Also i read about some bad storms? but i heard they passed. I do not think that would have any bearing on my pack making it to arrive in our local customs
    <br/>
    THANK YOU ALL IN ADVANCE
