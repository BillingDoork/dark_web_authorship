    Hey guys, I'm a relatively new user and I just had a quick question. How dangerous is it exactly to get something shipped to your home address? I don't plan on buying anything in bulk, just small stuff for personal use but I am curious. I noticed that the Buyer's Guide said I should have another house, but the only one really available is an hour drive away and pretty inconvenient to get to. So, I was wondering what your input was?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for your help!  ;)

    You will be fine ordering to your home address just use a slightly different name if it's something you don't have to sign for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And use different altercations to your address like Dr. or Drive, St or Street there are loads.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use different type of names if you have several packages like
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mr. Average Joe
    <br/>
    Average Joe
    <br/>
    A. Joe

    My advice just use your real name and address never use a fake name and always if you can order domestic.
    <br/>
    When ordering domestic there is literally no risk as there is no customs process as opposed to ordering internationally.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But always remember anyone can send anything to anyone in the the mail just because it has your name on it doesn't mean it's yours.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kind Regards

    But use different variations of your name / address, as this would happen in real life.

    No, use the same name you would if you were receiving a letter from friends, family, or amazon. You want to keep it consistent so your mail person doesn't notice anything odd.
