    So I'm thinking about broadening my horizons as I seem to have a lot of spare time on my hands these days. The thought came across me to volunteer my time at some sort of homeless shelter / mission. I know, I know.. what you are all thinking.. what a fair dink-um guy! Kudos.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I figure these sort of places HELP THE HOMELESS by possibly receiving the homeless person(s) mail. I'm positive that some places do this for the homeless. Could it be that I could work my way into a position where I would take an administrative voluntary role, where I could be the guy that controls the mail sorting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything ever goes hay-wire, eg: I order bulk smack in some homeless persons name to their designated mailbox at this facility.. the fall back could be "Oh! He's back on the smack again is he? *** Sheds a tear ***
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going to investigate as I really want to order bulk drugs to the homeless.. only intercept them for my own consumption, before they could get their greedy hands on em.

    Oh Bruce, don't get me wrong.. I would do all the required tasks like feeding them, giving them sound advice on a better pathway for their future, provide all the necessary support, care &amp; love that is needed.... with the end goal of having full control of the facilities mailbox sorting with the aim of ordering bulk amount of drugs for my own benefit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pure evil.. LOL, ambitions.  :D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They say get creative about your importation strategy.. with constant refinement, maybe I'm just thinking outside the box a bit too much?

    The problem of this is: how much time it will take you to arrive to that position? (admitting even that you can arrive in there, it is not you who decide where they will collocate you just in case)

    Sounds like quite a scheme, lol! One of the more creative "drops" we've ever heard as vendors, that's for sure. Seems like you could do this by working for a large apartment complex or university. We had a client many years ago that found himself as in charge of the office which received and delivered all material coming in for professors at a university. He had packages being sent to the professors labeled as chemicals etc. from different chemical companies. Worked well for quite awhile. Seems like your idea would work on this same theory, just remember the judge will have NO sympathy for you should anything go wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck!

    I will go to extreme measures to import bulk amounts of the drug of my choice for my own personal consumption. No one will stand in my way.  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is time to increase the multiple drop points by x5 so it can be done effectively and effieciently. I have a few solid ideas in my head .. this one is more of a piss-take as it would require too much effort on my end, but it's all good to brainstorm whacked out ideas. :P

    This could take a serious amount of time.. More than likely if they do have a mail area for the Homless, there is alreaady im sure someone in those shoes u wanna fill, and doubt they will just in a matter of months fire the person and give u the role..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They probley have some of the homeless guys do work at the shelter to earn their keep and thats one of their jobs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just seems pretty fucked up for one, and 2 very time consuming for a slim chance.. IMO..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im sure u can come up with something else.. If u can order kil'os of dope/smack whatever, then help someone get a rental house pay the rent and in return, tell the person u are gonna have mail come there...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i dunno , im sure there is waaay better idea in ur head than trying to set up a Already homless guy who is already really in a bad place in life, and u would wanna risk making one of these ppls lives worse.?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If so, u gonna pay for the lawyer he will need to get him cleared at least?

    Thinking about going to volunteer my services / mingle with the elderly residents at the nursing home down the road, get to know the residents.. do some nice deeds, listen to there bullshit old time inspiring stories and offer to collect their mail each and every day and bring it to their doorstep.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sit down have a cup a tea and scones, keep them company for a period of time and exploit those mother fuckers by getting bulk product sent to the mailboxes now under your control.

    If you actually do some charity then this is a gray area we won't judge you for. But you better make someone have a new AWESOME life if your going to try and profit. Like buy that person new clothes and get them an apt for 3 months so they can get a job and move on.

    Aside from this being morally vile, it's also pretty stupid IMHO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If some shipment of BULK drugs that cost more than the average person's earnings in half a year shows up, do you really expect me to believe that it belongs to the homeless guy? ::)

    <br/>
    Anyone there would be HIGHLY scrutinized because it's so obvious that it was most likely someone with funds--staff. The fact that it's also morally vile will have the book thrown so hard in your face that you'd possible not even get anywhere near a minimum sentence. The term "aggravated" comes to mind.

    You'd honestly be better off getting someone with moderate income--say, a college student with well-to-do parents. Profiling is a powerful part of any case.

    How would you even get caught? How would the homeless get in trouble? Only if someone was stupid enough to incriminate themselves, most likely. If it was a large order, maybe in a place where LE didn't have anything better to do, I would worry, but for smaller orders, I'm not seeing much risk.

    This is a great idea, but to better support the story and profit more get them addicted to heroin. The homeless are the perfect target but I think the elderly will be easier to manipulate because not many people love them. Fuck morals 8)

    Please reference another thread in which this scheme has failed. (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112893.msg1106036#msg1106036).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, for your consideration... Any plan that does not account for the obfuscation of the package between postal reception and firm reception is incomplete and will not survive an investigation. "Follow that package!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "On Tuesday, JPD and postal agents conducted a controlled delivery with the intercepted package. The package was outfitted with a beacon transmitter that emits a signal if and when the package has been opened."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please try to contribute some relevant information amidst your personal feelings.

    Why all this hassle? Why not just apply for a job as a mailman? THEN you have the control of every mail in a whole area :)
