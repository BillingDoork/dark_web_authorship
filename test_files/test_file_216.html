    well this sucks.... i guess it's about that time, especially after so many successful transactions.  came home from work today to discover a letter from US customs, describing my order very precisely.  it was a personal amount of ketamine from a vendor i'd rather not say.  the amount was less than 1.5 grams  it was NOT from the netherlands.  it was shipped from a country which is considered 'safe' from what i understand.  they weighed it and tested it to be K, all indicated within the notice.  that surprises me because the order wasn't in transit very long.  they pulled this off pretty quickly if you ask me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    letter seems legit and gave me a good scare.  says i have 30 days to deal appeal.  if i don't appeal the following is mentioned:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "If you take no action, or if you elect to abandon the property, this office will commence administrative forfeiture proceeds on or about 30 days from the date of this letter with no further notice to you."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what does this mean?  is it safe to ignore, wipe all data, clear my home of contraband and play it safe going forward?  i just want to do what's in the best interest of myself, even if that means abandoning SR  :-[
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i googled the letter and it seems pretty common.  i believe this is what everyone classifies as a 'love letter'.  i hope it's that simple.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what sort of comments or comfort can you provide?  thanks everyone.

    Ignore the letter, responding to it is an admission of guilt. You should clean house and your system.

    thanks limitless.  i am d'banning my system tonight.  thankfully the only thing i kept was the tor browser bundle since i had the url memorized.  no bitcoin/pgp on this system.  i go somewhere else for that  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i just cleaned my home, there is nothing left but a little grass.  i'm fine if you bust down my door and catch my in posession with 2 grams of weed and a vaporizer.  i'm pretty confident that won't go far in court.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hopefully the vendor will provide some sort of fair resolution, that would help!  i've probably received over 20 international orders with no problems.  some of those orders were sketchy in packaging.  this vendor in particular is supposed to have damn good packaging and with such a low amount i really wasn't concerned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    at first the letter puckered my anus.  all my googling has comforted me somewhat.

    You should think about using TOR/BTC etc from a flashdrive with a TrueCrypt hidden partition on it, it's the most secure way.

    that's where my btc wallet and pgp encryption exist.  i don't know why i never moved the tor bundle to my flash drive.  but yes, you're right.  to be honest it doesn't really matter.  i've had some amazing experiences on SR, over 80 transactions in the past year.  never had ONE issue!!!  my track record is great and i've never been scammed - because i refuse to FE.  anyway, it's time to take a break from SR.  i have a pretty good life and don't want to throw it away over a website.  it just sucks because the products available on the street are very dangerous and adulterated/cut with very dangerous fillers.  SR and the reputation/ratings/forums helped me to find safe drugs for personal use.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    arrrr this sucks, i don't want to say goodbye to SR but i know it's the right decision.  see ya on the flip side!  if i receive any more information surrounding this letter i'll be sure to keep this thread updated.

    Just use the same address again. Order something small. Well, I mean... Wait 1-2 months. But fuck them. Use the same address.

    There were some people here that said they still receive packages at the same address even after receiving a love mail. They just don't really care.
