    It all comes down to how the vendor packages it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If its done well it shouldn't smell
    <br/>
    If done poorly you wont have to worry, they'll catch it before it even hits your PO ;)

    I order zips to elbows on the reg here and off the road and no vendor or anyone has ever had it smell... there would be an idiot and very unprofessional if that was the case but IMO I would never ship more than an ounce to a PO.. I don't even think its good idea to ship to PO boxes anyways but just my opinion.. for sure would not do a QP or HP as it will be a big box and unless you get a lot of regular packages and mail there that doesn't fit then I wouldn't but if you do then you most likely fine actually!

    Hey brother, I have used a PO Box to receive cannabis and it was no problem at all! I think most vendors send anything over an oz in multiple packages just to be safe, though it depends on the vendor. If your vendor puts care into the packaging it won't smell at all outside of the box, period. Get set up with a good vendor with great ratings and sift through their reviews to find the ones that mention packaging. You have nothing to worry about shipping to a PO Box. It is actually awesome going in and getting your package knowing the person at the desk handing it to you has no idea of the beauty inside.

    Shouldn't be a problem.  Just use a box that is big enough to receive the package (to avoid having to pick it up in person).  Work with the vendor to get smaller packages if you need to.  Cannabis vendors on SR are generally very good at stink-proofing their parcels--I have never received a weed order that I could smell inside the package.  In fact most weed orders I've received don't even smell inside the first vac-seal (except probably to dogs).

    Ive Had weed shipped domestic to a POB no problem, as long as the vendor vac seals it, I would recommend priority, just to have it out of the post sooner, and don't let it sit at your box.

    You still have to "pick it up in person" regardless. If you mean "go to the person at the front desk" it's still not a big deal. You walk up there like the boss that you are with the slip they place in your box and get the package. There is no need for a bigger box, use the smallest one, it will cost you about $13.00 every 3 months. Cheap and easy. No use for a giant steel box unless you want to get your package after hours (and the big price tag that comes with the big box is worth that to you). Also, purchasing a bigger box just adds to suspicion, the goal is to blend in with everyone else.

    Man honestly unless you receive packages that size somewhat regularly I would not start with 2 elbows... yes though rocker is reliable and safe... but I know from other posts you are all about safety and 2 lbs is a lot for a first test run man... shit also at those prices is crazy... obviously not sure where you live so profit margin could be there and worth it for you but damn me 3400..i like 2400 more than that lol ;)
