    I am from EU. Everyone is talking here about receiving package without signing, that is important to not get busted
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thing is that in my country I receive small paper that I have package waiting in postal office. I have to go there,
    <br/>
    show ID and sign on the paper to receive the package. So I must sign everytime I receive any package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any suggestions?

    It's the same for me but only for big packages, they have to be over 3-4 cm thick. Do you have to do that for flat letters too? I doubt that...
    <br/>
    Most of the products here get shipped in flat letters so I never had that problem. If you re not planning to order bulk, that's what you ll get too.

    Yes, same for me. And yes, I will mostly get thicker packages, because I am ordering only marihuana for now, only 100g+.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas how to make this more safely?

    Hmm, that's different. To be honest signing is not your biggest problem, the worst case scenario is getting a controlled delivery, and signing isn't going to make a big difference if you get busted while exiting the post office with the stuff in hand. Perhaps you should talk to the vendor and ask him if he has dealt with the same situation in the past, or think about different delivery methods, a PO box maybe?

    Buy a metal-box which can't be opened without a key once you close it and write "Package for me? Just throw it in here and close the door" Tell your postal guy that it is annoying to go to the office every time and he should put it in there ;)
