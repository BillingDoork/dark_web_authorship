    Absolutely do NOT use the same address. Count the letter as a friendly warning and don't piss them off catching you again

    You have been given a get out jail free card, well letter in this case, don't push your luck son...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first one they found they just though ' silly boy(or girl)' and binned it... after recording the details of who/when/what
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the second one they got they referenced the first time and went ' DAHFUQ you playing at kid? We don't like it when a pattern of behavoir emerges with this stuff... If we have caught 2 orders how many have made it through?? hmmm ONE MORE CHANCE' and sent the letter.... and added to the details of the first one with the details of this second one...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your at the plate, 2 strikes down.... do you bunt and get local or go for the home run and maybe strike out? Remembering that striking out may involve the opportunity to diversify your circle of friends with all the other inmates you will meet. You will make some fast friends for sure....

    Be safe above all else... a pill is only fun if your free after all.

    Use a new address. LE know that whoever lives at your address has been ordering drugs in the mail. They've not really done anything about it because it isn't worth their time and money, but you can't just piss in their faces. Unfortunately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you decide to go against everyone's advice, then order domestically. But I wouldn't even do this because LE know you're ordering drugs to your house and may be checking all of your mail. The fact you'd have seized packages in the past makes it pretty easy to get a conviction, where there may have been question marks the first time round.

    I have got one question to this! How can LE be able to check all of your mail? I mean I guess there are a lot of love letters going out every week, so how should they be able to control all these packages? Especially if you live in a large city, then there are so much packages and letters that it would be really hard to look for that (your) specific address (AND all the other flagged addresses) and then look into/scan every package. I guess every post office has to enter the receiving address into a computer when they are sending packages, and if your address is flagged then they notice LE about this, is this the method they use?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if they really control every package which comes to this address, than how about using your REAL NAME (maybe slightly changed first name) but the address from your neighbor (or neighbor's neighbor, if you can be sure that they know you and bring the package to you after they received it)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last option would be to set up a PO Box and start using this as a new address i guess

    Ordering to that address again would be idiotic. You realize you are committing felonies right? They were kind enough to give you a slap on the wrist instead of throwing you in fucking prison.

    I don't actually know the answers to your questions. I may have spoke more confidently than I should have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was me, I would assume what I said to be true, even though it is likely exaggerating the risks. It's my opinion, based on logic rather than experience or knowledge. There is no way to know how much if any of your other mail is being scrutinised and to what extent. It's not worth the risk.

    sure you are right, lately i was just thinking about the case that my address is going to be flagged and what options i would have then (because another delivery address seems to be no option to me)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But i really wonder if you could still open a PO box with your real name after your address has been flaggedÂ  ???
