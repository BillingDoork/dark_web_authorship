    Receiving the package in the mail is, in my opinion, the biggest security risk with this whole process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Turning cash into BTC anonymously - easy. very little risk
    <br/>
    Logging into the marketplace communicating with encrypted messaging, self destructing encrypted messages if necessary and purchasing goods with untraceable currency - easy (thanks to all who make this possible)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Giving someone an address, even if it is a friends still could easily get you caught up. You're putting a lot of trust in a vendor who you do not know or CAN not trust. If you are buying and caught up this will be how they get you. Everything else in place is rock solid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All I can think of is a fake ID to get the PO Box then a disguise when you go get the package and only get a few shipments before new fake ID and PO Box in a new location.
    <br/>
    Even that I am sure they can still get you on one of those few deliveries.
    <br/>

    My hunch is the fake ID / intentional forgery to get a PO Box is a bigger crime than possessing a small amount of contraband they can't prove you ordered....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fwiw. Good luck!
