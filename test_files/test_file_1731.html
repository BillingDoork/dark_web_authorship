    This is something i always wondered about. I'd order no more then 14 grams and if the package was ever detected would le do a controlled delivery for that little amount or would they still attempt it? I'm talking domestic in the usa to the usa just a fyi.

    I'm just speculating but I'm thinking the gas for the LE vehicle, the wage to pay employee(s) for the CD, and the opportunity cost of LE to pursue as opposed to bigger fish is far greater than the cost and rewards of doing a CD for a half zip.  It would be a huge waste of resources and tax payer dollars for them to pursue such a trivial amount.  As long as you use vendors that package well you shouldn't have to worry.

    I'm also just speculating, but I'm gonna say it depends where you live. Do you live in a major urban area or in the middle of nowhere? Are your local LEAs bored or do they have too many (serious) crimes to investigate?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think in some small communities, where there's no crime at all and the cops are bored out of their minds, it makes sense that busting someone for a 1/2 OZ of weed would be something LE would consider spending their resources on. On the other hand, in large urban areas teeming with violent crime, a 1/2 OZ of weed in the mail would be the least of their worries.

    Anything is possible, but Highly unlikely even at the state level Possession of Marijuana Under An OZ is only a misdemeanor. However The Real Trouble comes because sending Illegal substances such as schedule 1 drugs like Marijuana through the mail is a federal Crime. So i would say they would only waste their time and resources on a CD if they think they can roll you up and receive good information on where you got it from or use you as a stepping stone to get someone else and or if you have a criminal record your chances increase. Personally anything more than 7g's i would use a drop house. You can always make more money, you cant erase Felonies. Greed and impatiens is what gets people caught.

    Make sure your order doesn't have to be signed for, simple.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you know, 100%, that you are not required to sign for your package, and some cocksucker rocks up and ask's you to sign, you know nothing about it, no one lives here by that name, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if you have requested tracking, and have to sign, and your order is intercepted, then your open to a CD for sure. But its all risk, to make you feel better, i've signed for an international order, was only a few grams, but still, it was to a virgin drop, and i knew the vendors stealth was, and still is impeccable.
