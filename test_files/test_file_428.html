    Starting this topic as a general discussion of items from 2StopOz and 1StopOz in order to avoid giving these great dealers bad rep in the feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recently ordered quantity: x2 of the 1g bud that 2StopOz, or 1StopOz (can't remember) was selling at the time. However when I confirmed and received my order, I was only confirming 1g. My scalies are broken and I keep forgetting to get new ones, so I didn't weight up what I received. Just trying to get into communication with 2Stop/1Stop to check if another is on its way or if they packed both 1g orders into the same bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks guys, sorry for the hassle.

    I've ordered from 1stop many times with no worries but I'm not sure what your question is... If you didn't have scales to weigh it then just ask him to confirm what he sent you, everything I've received from him has been spot on or a little overweight.

    n00b to SR forum and SR, so I understand my low number of posts may detract from my vendor feedback, but I have seen little negative feedback regarding this vendor, so I am sure most people are aware of how easy shard transactions with 2StopOZ are!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He/ she made navigating through SR process extremely easy.  I have completed a couple of trans with him/her now, both were slightly complicated on my end (one when the system was down and one when I changed my order half way through) always with prompt replies and a friendly demeanor.   Never acted like I was a hassle!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good packaging, overweight and on time on both occasions.   Product is much better than what I am getting on the street and I will be returning!  Thank-you Silk Road for delivering a sane, professional shard vendor!

    i Bought half bag of weed from 1stop and have bought a couple of MD caps from 2stop and have had no problem with either, 1stops was a couple days in processing but got here 1 day after marked in transit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the weed was ok and lasted me about a week(which is pretty good) could have been a little drier though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    all in all no complaints with either of them.

    Geez mate, your a forgiving bloke! Something marked "in-transit" on the 18/12/12 would have arrived by now, being domestic. A vendor shouldn't take an order if he can't get it out in a timely manner. He may be enjoying some family time and good luck to him if he is, but from what your describing, it sounds an awful lot like your order was put "in-transit" to prevent you cancelling it yourself. At the end of the day, a vendor knows his cut off day, where orders placed after that date won't get out in time. However, having not been told any different by the vendor, your well within your rights to have a whinge about an order posted on the 18/12 which is still yet to arrive. Somethings not right here.

    Yeah its not good enough. Family time or not, thats nearly 2 weeks for a domestic order. To not have returned a single email within that time is worrying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they needed time off for whatever reasons, it should have been posted on their vendor page.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you dont get another reply i'd message SR and see what they say.

    Coins are still in escrow so all good there but sucks to destroy my stats for a domestic weed order. Still no message from 1stop since sending him my TX #. Sucks having to clean shit out of the house &amp; pull down a single small plant if it doesn't arrive in Wednesday post.

    What do you mean by "destroy my stats"?  Did you open a dispute in the Resolution Center to extend the due date out past the original 17 days?

    A vendor that has the feedback, transactions and reputation such as 1Stop deserves some benefit of the doubt IMO. You have no idea wtf has happened and for all we know the vendor could have had an accident, come down sick, been busted etc etc. Hold back on the flames till you get the hot tip about whats going on here. I notice no 1Stop listings too so this could be more serious than just a bag or 2 of weed so spare a thought for them too..... I don't think they would have no listings and be messing a customer around if they had the choice (1Stop was always focused on customer satisfaction from what I know and was a point of personal pride for them) sucks I know but you need to just chill out and wait... and maybe clean house too especially if its your real name and address that you gave over for the order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FTP.... FTP..... never thought I would actually say that but more and more its how I feel. There just doesn't seem to be any balance there any more and its all about fucking people lives at the worst time they can... say Christmas for example. So while they go for the money shots and big ticket items, drug users and sellers the violent criminals are given good behavior bond and go kidnap and rape and murder young girls... Fuck The Police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope your all good wherever you are 1Stop mate... thoughts and prayers are with you.

    Agree with above comments, with the rep that the 1/2Stop vendors have, I am sure its just a misunderstanding/ mistake that will get cleared soon.  No way would they want to ruin that rep over one package.

    I am confident you will get everything!

    Sorry if I seemed to antagonistic or defensive (odd mix I know but such is the beast that is me) but I had just gotten some very very bad news and its was early morning on my second day with no sleep and no gear!! Its horrifying that I get insomnia when I'm out of shard and sleep like clockwork when I do have it.. anyway I digress so back to clarifying my statement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The lack of communication from 1Stop should say it all IMO. This is not a vendor that just ignores people for extended lengths of time no mater the circumstances. I would also like to say that I guess in some way I do hope I am thought of as a "Friend" of sorts to ALL vendors and customers. This is a war after all and my enemies enemy... More precisely though I have grown to have a deep fondness for 2Stop and by extension 1Stop but this is only because of the integrity that these guys have built in to their core and have demonstrated practically in their dealing with myself and others and so my statements here and elsewhere regarding these vendors has not been influenced by any personal loyalty or anything along these lines, in fact I am harder on and hold anyone I consider a friend to a higher standard so if I believed anything untoward was going on I would openly call them on it. I have formed this new account to achieve 2 things; firstly to distance my SR account nick from my forum nick for the security aspects and to also be able to make a statement that can people read between the lines if they so wish. Looking at this situation we must look at the whole story before we say anything about it being too long or not up to par. SO the things I would factor in include that all of 1Stops listings have gone down. 1Stop has not replied to anyone's messages whether they had orders or not. There is nothing on his page as explanation for the absence. which all adds up to something serious has gone wrong. If he was taking some time he would have a notice up so I have this feeling something has gone down that is serious enough to stop him from coming onto SR to respond.

    I thought that it was recorded on your buyer profile how many resolutions you go through &amp; if you have had refunds or not... I have good buyer stats at the moment but if I clock up a refund sellers are more likely to not deal with me or require FE (not happening)... Shouldn't matter I guess. Just sucks a bit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Got a message from 2stop that gives me a little faith that things might get fixed &amp; it doesn't sound like end of days or anything drastic like a bust but who knows... I just really hope that it was never sent, I don't want to write this address off due to a smelly ol package somewhere in aus post with my address on it :/

     I thought that it was recorded on your buyer profile how many resolutions you go through &amp; if you have had refunds or not... I have good buyer stats at the moment but if I clock up a refund sellers are more likely to not deal with me or require FE (not happening)... Shouldn't matter I guess. Just sucks a bit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I messaged 2Stop &amp; he wrote the below:

      Thanks for your concern, appreciate it!

      Sorry about all this mate, situations are fucked sometimes!

      We'll fix it 100% with either a refund or reship but it just might take a couple of days to get things 100% in full swing.

     So that gives me a little faith that things might get fixed &amp; it doesn't sound like end of days or anything drastic like a bust but who knows... I just really hope that it was never sent, I don't want to write this address off due to a smelly ol package somewhere in aus post with my address on it :/

    I personally wouldn't be sending a vendor my address again? That alone raises some RED flags for me. I would request that the vendor cancel your order and refund your coins. I doubt it was ever sent if he is requesting your info. again! Why doesn't this person from 2Stop create a thread and post info. relating to what happened to his associate, 1Stop?  That would make sense to me but instead they are very quiet on the matter. If the vendor cancels your order, your buyer stats won't be affected. However, if you end up in the Resolution Center and receive a refund that way, then that will contribute to your Refund Rate in your purchasing stats. Good luck with things.

    I've also had problems with 1StopOz recently.  I haven't started leaving negative reviews yet, but 10 mdma caps marked as shipped on the 20th of Dec still hasn't arrived.  I might have confused him by asking for single packaging... I ordered a small amount of weed at the same time, but only the weed arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I paid for shipping for both items and said if it's too hard or not secure, to just send it as 2 packages - anyway, that complication made me think he was going to insist that the mdma was sent, but to his credit he didn't say that... he just asked for both tx numbers again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He's been slow to reply, but one of the messages I got indicated he was absolutely swamped by messages and orders.  I can't see what being swamped has to do with marking a package as sent when it hasn't been sent (although it does explain the lack of communication)... but vendors should leave it in processing, so instead of messing the customers about, you give them an opportunity to cancel the order if unshipped after 4 days and order off someone else who can fill the order and is up front about when they're going on holidays etc and keeps their customers informed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not happy with this latest round and will be reluctant to buy off any of the xStopOz's again, but depending on what he says when he starts communicating again with customers, perhaps I'll change my mind.

    I bought off 1stopOz on the 24th (item was marked 'in transit' the same day). It didn't arrive today, which is frustrating as I am really hanging. The other packages I bought off him arrived in 1 business day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's really annoying if he has put it as 'in transit' without posting it yet. What the hell is the point of that? Seems a bit dodgy if you ask me.

    i also ordered from 1stop on 27th but never received delivery. how long does the resolution process take usually?
    <br/>
    it seems like he ran out of stuff because reading the threads and dates that people stopped receiving delivery's its seems like some products he kept delivering a lil bit longer and other things stopped a bit earlier. i got a delivery from him on the 24th but some people didn't get orders from mid December for different products. Bit strange.

    From my experience, first you have to wait the 17 days from being marked in transit down to the resolution process which starts at 6-7 days remaining in transit.
    <br/>
    Then you have the option to resolve. 5-7 days from that the vendor gets the opportunity to give a secondary resolution.  Then it all depends on if there is a discussion or whether SR steps in and makes the call.  I believe the one and only time something similar happened to me it took nearly 2 months until i was refunded %100.  I suggest everyone having issues contacts SR ADMINS as the more of us who do so, the stronger of a case we will have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once again I hope all is well and none of this is necessary.  2Stops ICE was crackin!

    Just updating my experience with 1StopOz.  10 x MDMA caps never arrived.  Marked as shipped on 20th December.
    <br/>
    1StopOz did reply to one of my messages, indicating he was getting over 120 orders a day and over 150 messages a day.
    <br/>
    Greedy.  Shouldn't mark the orders as sent if overloaded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I got my reply after others were worrying about what had happened to 1StopOz.  So if there's some mishap, or he got busted or I dunno what...
    <br/>
    whatever it was, after the troubles started, the excuse I got was that he was getting over 120 orders a day and therefore he
    <br/>
    marked the product as sent when it wasnt.  You decide how you feel about that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Got 100% refund today through SR dispute resolution.

    Damnit, I was really hoping to get a refund ASAP. I can't buy any more BTC this week so I'm not in a good position. Thanks alot 1StopOZ!  &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I submitted a resolution yesterday, was really hoping that it could be resolved before the 5 day period. Would it be worth messaging SR support to see if they can speed up the process? They should be aware 1StopOZ has disappeared, so they I hope they don't have to wait for a response from him.

    It is a very frustrating thing to have to go through.  The resolution process is there for both parties, we agree to these terms before we buy, so I highly doubt they will put as rush on the system.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's some crazy talk and it can be completely debunked by looking at the public feedback stats, they are not doing 120 orders a day. We are also popular vendors and the most messages we have received in a day was 96 and on a normal day we get around 45 to 70. We reply to EVERY one, even the stupid questions (30%).

    I'm in the same predicament as you guys, I ordered half an ounce of weed on the 27th. The order status changed to in transit within hours of making the order, but it's been almost 2 weeks with no package, and none of my messages have been replied to. I asked SR support if they would resolve the issue earlier, but they didn't think there was enough cause for concern, so i guess I'm going to have to be sober for the next week or so.  :'(

    So at what point does someone call it and say this vendor has gone rogue?

    Wouldn't kill them to chime in on here and calm some nerves, but then if they can't be arsed responding to messages on the main site why would they bother on here.

    I think it is easy to tell if it is a scam or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the vendor disappears completely, and transactions stay in processing, then they may have been arrested, had a car accident, and so on, but if they are not replying to messages, not sending packages, but still putting transactions into transit so people can't cancel, I would say that is pretty clearly a scam.
    <br/>

    All I can say is that I hope people didn't FE with this vendor.

    I wanted to come on here and say 1stops weed was the worst shjit i had smoked in a while. I dont know if any of you got their weed packages, but the shit he was selling before xmas was terrible. Dense but horrible tasting, brown all over and so fucken harsh on my throat. I had to chuck it as it was not getting me stoned and i was coughing up brown and yellow shit from my throat.  Just thinking about the taste makes me squirm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It reminded me of the horrid brown bud shit that we were getting around 5-6 years ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also his mdma caps were terrible.

    It's not that we don't know how to grow (fuck we have one of the best climates to grow bud) it's just they mass produce for the masses and grow shit strains that doesnt cost much to grow but can make a massive profit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The saying "Aussies only like to spend 5 cents on building a product but then demand a $20 return" is so fucken true. Proof is when pills became very popular scum like carl williams was cutting them with so much shit just to make huge profit margins. The same goes with coke.

    Yeah i ordered before xmas and 1stops bud was pretty lame i thought as well. I had spare coin so thought i'd try some.
    <br/>
    I can score weed easily, but wanted to try an SR vendors weed. So yeah i was far from impressed.
    <br/>
    I was going to try their caps, but after reading all of the reviews i gave them a miss, happy i did now.

    If someone bothered to grow really good quality strains here they would do very well, but perpetual harvest is hard for some people to keep going...hmm.

    1StopOZ refunded one of my orders (1oz of weed) today. My other order for 2 pills is still in resolution however.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm very happy I didn't have to wait the full duration of resolution... at least there was some good news in the end! However, I might wait a while before buying off him again.

    So what date did you get this message as you claim????
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2 things I want to say to this....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    firstly is that IF you actually received this message from 1Stops account then it was not sent by him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2nd...  IMO you have just lied through your ass for whatever reason... I could go on but honestly this thread has just destroyed my faith in anyone actually having an even handed response when something goes slightly awry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just goes to show how true the statement is... 'your only as good as your last deal'  seriously people... lets not become so jaded and suspicious that we always run to the cover of insulting and public attacks on vendors who have the runs on the board to deserve better... I know there was bad experiences in the past but this does not excuse the bad behavior of customers today...  Remember there is enough shit put on us all by LE and misinformation spread to cause fear without us all adding to it and fracturing the ranks of our force... such as it is..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway.. such is the nature of the beast and everyone should be well aware that the beast is not tame nor does it consider you and your weekend bag of weed special in any way. Anyone who has been buying drugs for any length of time will well understand that shit happens... and happens often... all the different shades of shit available too so guessing, speculating or assuming the brand of shit this time is foolish and an amateur mistake. Common but amateur. I am the first to admit it bums me waiting on my drugs and when shit does happen I really get bummed at either loosing cash or having to wait to get it back but... again... it happens.

    Sheesh.. I lament at seeing this sort of post by people. I really hope you are too young to know any better but what in hell makes you feel you deserve any explanation? You got a refund? good I am actually happy for you.. Beyond that mate you are so small and far down the food chain ... Explanations and groveling goes up the chain usually not down mate.... Despite the fact that there would be silly for them to say anything about anything that could be used to tie him IRL to SR and a vendor account... No mater what has happened there would be too much risk in saying 'blah blah happened to me IRL' as a vendor cause that may be just the thing that is used to tie them to here.. Imagine if they had been done IRL or some associates had been done or someone died or got sick and LE got this information from a statement made as a vendor explaining 'derp, this is why I decided to specifically fuck you by withholding your pills and weed'... would be fairly damning to the vendor cause Australia isn't that big a place and even if its just enough to plant the seed in some drug pigs mind....

     anyway.. such is the nature of the beast and everyone should be well aware that the beast is not tame nor does it consider you and your weekend bag of weed special in any way. Anyone who has been buying drugs for any length of time will well understand that shit happens... and happens often... all the different shades of shit available too so guessing, speculating or assuming the brand of shit this time is foolish and an amateur mistake. Common but amateur. I am the first to admit it bums me waiting on my drugs and when shit does happen I really get bummed at either loosing cash or having to wait to get it back but... again... it happens.

     Sheesh.. I lament at seeing this sort of post by people. I really hope you are too young to know any better but what in hell makes you feel you deserve any explanation? You got a refund? good I am actually happy for you.. Beyond that mate you are so small and far down the food chain ... Explanations and groveling goes up the chain usually not down mate.... Despite the fact that there would be silly for them to say anything about anything that could be used to tie him IRL to SR and a vendor account... No mater what has happened there would be too much risk in saying 'blah blah happened to me IRL' as a vendor cause that may be just the thing that is used to tie them to here.. Imagine if they had been done IRL or some associates had been done or someone died or got sick and LE got this information from a statement made as a vendor explaining 'derp, this is why I decided to specifically fuck you by withholding your pills and weed'... would be fairly damning to the vendor cause Australia isn't that big a place and even if its just enough to plant the seed in some drug pigs mind....
