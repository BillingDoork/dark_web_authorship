    Step 1: Copy the tracking number from a past order into your clipboard.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Go to (CLEARNET) http://www.barcodesinc.com/generator/index.php
    <br/>
    Step 3: Paste the *used* tracking number into the textbox region.
    <br/>
    Step 4: Set the dimensions to 500x200 pixels.
    <br/>
    Step 5: Deselect all check boxes except for the one that says 'Draw Value Text'.
    <br/>
    Step 6: Set the bar width to 2 pixels.
    <br/>
    Step 7: Choose the second smallest font size.
    <br/>
    Step 8: In the 'Symbology' section, select 'Code 128-C (numeric only)'.
    <br/>
    Step 9: Your tracking number should look something like this - 42085204950550001391313xxxxxxx, add 1 to any of the digits I have marked 'x'.
    <br/>
    ----There may be other ways to do step 10 but this but the only way I have tried so far, and it requires an iphone/ipad, or itouch----
    <br/>
    Step 10: Open the official USPS iphone app and go into scanning mode. Continue adding 1 to any of the digits marked 'x', generating a new barcode each time you change the number. Scan the barcode on the screen until your scanner grabs one.
    <br/>
    Step 11: Go to the track and confirm section of the app, or simply copy and paste this *new* number (if the scanner recognized it) into the usps website. If it says "Info Unavailable blah blah blah check back later blah blah blah..."
    <br/>
    Step 12: PRINT THAT SHIT OUT! :D You have yourself a working tracking label! If you stumble upon someone's used tracking number keep increasing the number until you find a virgin one.

    This may be a truly fantastic finding. Even if it's a flop I have to give you credit for putting in the time to do this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have 2 questions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. You confused me a bit on step 9 with the X's. Are you saying add the number 1 to any one of those spots that the X's take up? If it's further down the line, can you fill in the space preceding it with random numbers? Be as specific as you can here, because this is obviously a critical step in the process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. The iphone thing concerns me a bit. I feel as though your identity could be plastered all over this before you even use it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. For step 10, when you say scan the barcode on the screen, you mean scan the barcode you have generated on your computer screen, right there on the screen, correct?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. For step 12, how do you go about printing it out? Do you just print the barcode or are you able to input the DCN# into the USPS app and print the tracking label? And finally, wouldn't printing out JUST a barcode seem strange? Usually the barcodes on packages are rectangle printouts with all sorts of writing etc. on them as well (I'm sure you know what I'm talking about if you've ever received a tracked USPS/UPS package that was printed out online for legitimate purposes). Having JUST a barcode, well, I don't even know if the mailman would know to scan it if it's not easily identifiable that it is a USPS barcode. Also, I believe this could be used against the shipper as an identifying factor of their shipping method.'''
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT for my 4th question: I actually just thought of something. Perhaps if you can obtain a normal USPS tracking label you are using for legitimate purposes and save it as an image (I'm not sure if this can be done, but I don't know why it wouldn't be able to be done), you could photoshop the new barcode on in place of the old one, perhaps? Although I can't remember if they have a second barcode or not. I remember seeing on one a square barcode-type image, like you see on printed kiosk postage. I'm not sure. Food for thought, anyway.

     <br/>
     <br/>
     Me: Okay, I didn't do the best job of articulating this part. Say your tracking number was 123456789 (the x's are to protect my customers anonymity, because that is a real tracking number from one of my past orders). You would first try perhaps '123456799' and generate a barcode with that. I suggest changing only one number at a time because it would blend in more easily with the tracking numbers they are ACTUALLY giving out. The number in my OP is a priority mail tracking number. Different forms of tracking are formatted differently so if you just punched in some random numbers, while it might scan, it would also likely raise some unwanted eyebrows.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2. The iphone thing concerns me a bit. I feel as though your identity could be plastered all over this before you even use it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Me: The app doesn't make you create an account or anything so at most usps would have your apple id, I think? Not 100% on this one yet though.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3. For step 10, when you say scan the barcode on the screen, you mean scan the barcode you have generated on your computer screen, right there on the screen, correct?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Me: Exactly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     4. For step 12, how do you go about printing it out? Do you just print the barcode or are you able to input the DCN# into the USPS app and print the tracking label?

Also, I believe this could be used against the shipper as an identifying factor of their shipping method.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Me: This is something I have been pondering as well. First off, though you just click on the barcode you've generated and it opens it in a new window. You can just print out the webpage and cut it out from there, or whatever your preferred printing method is. Secondly, I think this problem could be remedied by comparing an official shipping label to the "bootleg" one, and tweaking the settings accordingly. You could even touch it up in an image editing program if need be (for exact duplication) as long as the bars remained the same size and shape.

    OOH!:D Just had a thought. When you go to an APC and ship priority with a non flat rate box it asks you "will this label fit?" and if you say no it prints out TWO stickers, one with postage and a QR code, and one with just the tracking number &amp; Barcode. THAT is the one we want to use. After I finish packing up these last couple orders I'm going to the APC near me to grab one of those. When I get back I'll scan it, erase the barcode (for security reasons) and upload it here.

    I don't know if changing to last few xxxx's to random numbers is a good thing. I was working on a system similar to this, op i'm sure you do realize there are various official usps bar coding software and unofficial usps intelligent mail bar coding software..   you linked to one of them i think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i was using the bar code/phone scanning app myself, then copying a bar code i generate online into a bar code decoder/encoder program, than using that program to generate the last few numbers of the bar code with the CORRECT ADDRESS.  You changed those last few numbers to something random, there may possibly be problems?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    well, instead of changing those last few numbers to something random, it would be much smarter to figure out how to input a real address into those bar code numbers using usps bar code encoding software.  This will assure those last few numbers on the tracking bar code are real addresses instead of non-random addresses.

    The x's are there to protect an individual's anonymity, I only changed one digit when I generated the new one. I'd be very interested in learning more about this code, I think you might be hot on the trail of the last piece of this puzzle..

    was reading usps manuals last few days, trying to figure out what exactly goes into a barcode, there is a pdf u can easily find and download..  i believe the last few numbers on the bar code are called "DELIVERY POINT" which includes the last two numbers of the physical address the package is going to.  So that one number you changed, will  alter DELIVERY POINT, if that is already correct you should be good, but its def not a good idea to generate a customers real address using usps network.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm trying to find the correct software needed at this point in time(didn't look too hard yet), which will allow me to generate my own tracking code by inputting my own address into the tracking field via imported bar coded information.  I already came across a few different softwares, but it don't allow me to input address fields, so still searching.   Also when figured out, i gotta find a way to get my postman to scan my tracking label, to make sure it's properly coded, that shouldn't be hard
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my ultimate goal is pay and ship with pay pal without compromising customer security; thus i need to enter slightly fake information when generating online code, then altering it offline to display REAL ADDRESS DELIVERY POINT CODE.

    Yeah really fucking with the usps system, one that you have no idea how it actualy works is probably the easiest way to get ur shit flagged and your customer a controlled delivery. I found a better way than this hack bullshit.

    Wait, hold on a minute. Tracking slips are not "allocated" to addresses. That is only done once the package is in transit. You don't need to learn how to edit a barcode to set it to a certain delivery point - the DCN is blank, and the postmen scan it as it moves on its way to its destination. You don't need to code the address in; they do that for you. In fact, it would probably look very strange if you DID code an address into the barcode.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please tell me if I am missing something here. This is how I remember the DCN slips working - I'm not sure if the 400s are different. But if you can con a postal worker out of a stack of 400s then they are certainly not allocated to any one address. So that approach makes no sense under the pretense that DCN slips don't need the delivery address encoded in them prior to being sent. OP's method is fine - the only difficulty now is finding out how to print it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AOD - I'm assuming that APC printout would be a sticker, correct? Wouldn't it follow then that it would be a bit strange to print it out on normal paper and, say, tape it to a box? I'm not sure. Maybe it matters and maybe it doesn't. I'm not sure if avery has any sticker labels that would fit the size of the APC one after it is edited and printed out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for your contributions AOD. They may prove to be literally invaluable to the community.

     Wait, hold on a minute. Tracking slips are not "allocated" to addresses. That is only done once the package is in transit. You don't need to learn how to edit a barcode to set it to a certain delivery point - the DCN is blank, and the postmen scan it as it moves on its way to its destination. You don't need to code the address in; they do that for you. In fact, it would probably look very strange if you DID code an address into the barcode.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Please tell me if I am missing something here. This is how I remember the DCN slips working - I'm not sure if the 400s are different. But if you can con a postal worker out of a stack of 400s then they are certainly not allocated to any one address. So that approach makes no sense under the pretense that DCN slips don't need the delivery address encoded in them prior to being sent. OP's method is fine - the only difficulty now is finding out how to print it.

     AOD - I'm assuming that APC printout would be a sticker, correct? Wouldn't it follow then that it would be a bit strange to print it out on normal paper and, say, tape it to a box? I'm not sure. Maybe it matters and maybe it doesn't. I'm not sure if avery has any sticker labels that would fit the size of the APC one after it is edited and printed out.

     Thanks for your contributions AOD. They may prove to be literally invaluable to the community.

    They are talking about tracking numbers and barcodes that you print at the kiosk and online.  They need one that you can print on your computer that wont look out of place.  Perhaps those ones have an address or something encoding in them.  I do not know.

    Could it not be kind of sketchy to use a made up tracking number on a package? Seems to me that something like this could just make a package really stand out as being illegitimate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless you're really just guessing an unused tracking ID number. Then it would just be like any other in the system?

    I think it would freak me out if a vendor was using this method on a package sent to me. I'd rather it not be tracked than have a chance of coming off as a sketchy package.

    Thanks for the feedback everybody! And sorry for not following up/answering questions on here promptly. I've been (and still am) getting hit real hard with orders as of late and have not had any time to relax on the forums, unfortunately. I'll make good on my promise to upload that modified barcode at some point tomorrow, as well as give your ideas the reflection and responses they deserve :)
    <br/>
    Cheers!

    @OP - You probably already found this, but there are suppressed-from-readable-text numbers on the new IMb codes - some wouldn't change with address but some might, such as the ZIP/+4 code. If the readable numbers don't line up with the bar code, you have a potential problem. Don't know, didn't have the ability to check what would happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, check digit is the last digit, it needs to match up, or these won't scan properly per my, uh, label printer test which I asked for test scan on. Only tried one, it made an unhappy noise, I did not get the chance to investigate further.

    I'm no expert on USPS or tracking, but this is my immediate reaction x100.  Even if it scans with USPS and goes through the system, that doesn't mean it wont set off some red flag somewhere.  Or maybe it only sets off a red flag 10% of the time when you guess specific entries they skipped to test for this sort of thing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe in the long term something like this could be figured out, but I really hope it isn't getting used on unsuspecting customers in the mean time.  I could see LE just sitting on something like this until lots of people are doing it, and it would just hand customers names/addresses (as well as the area vendors are shipping from).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe I am just paranoid, but I would switch over to untracked orders and only letting trusted customers use escrow before I would start trying to use fake tracking barcodes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there something I am missing that somehow  makes this safe or prevents the USPS tracking system (which I don't really think anyone here understands in detail) from flagging these sorts of fake addresses.  You will be *lucky* if they immediately just stop allowing them to be used, but it could get so much worse.
