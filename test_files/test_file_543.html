    which is strange because the first time i tracked my package it told me it was on its way to australia. Tyler says he has a great success rate to australia and im not usually a unlucky person lol, i was just wondering if there is another possibility besides it being seized?

    why dont you message him directly rather than making another thread about australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do you think hes gonna ring up australian customs and ask? or maybe he'll look into his crystal ball

    Lol I bet u hope for a lot of things matey :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But to answer your question I think the crystal ball would give me the most accurate answer? But I doubt u no wat ur talkin about seen as no such thing exists
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But to anyone who has common sense I'm asking if there's another explanation as to why the tracking number stopped working?

    It doesnt sound like he sent it at all.

    It would at least register an initial scan, no ?

    Guys, I've purchased from Tyler many times in the past and never had any issues to Australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, for the most part anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But either way, it generally takes a few days before your tracking number registers on the postal website.
