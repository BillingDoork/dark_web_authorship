    I just opened a Post office box last week, and am trying to get actual mail sent to it that so that i am not just receiving packages from the road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas on what to sign up for so that i have some "legit" mail to blend with the packages i will be receiving off the road?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All help is appreciated, thank you.

    I would get a magazine subscription, a couple of random amazon packages now and again, and try and get some letters, not sure where you could get them from.. Maybe send a couple yourself?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the PO box is not in your name, then you could pay for subscriptions / amazon from a virtual visa

    You can request up to 5 free diff catalogs.  Just tried it with phony info and..

    "Thank you for your interest in our catalogs. The catalogs you requested will arrive in seven to ten business days."

    Surely getting a load of junk mail to a PO Box you recently opened looks more suss?

    Well, i applied for a paintball newsletter which isn't suspicious because i play paintball. I'm not talking about sending stuff that has nothing to do with me, i'm talking more about sending mail that somehow relates to my interests, activities, etc.

     I think the person loading mail in hundreds of PO boxes day in and day out for the last however many years is not thinking about anything. They are not going to remember if you only get packages. They are not going to think about the ratio of catalogs vs packages you get vs all the other boxes.  You guys are over thinking this.

    No kidding, even IF it was the same person every time. Unless you live in some one horse town with a population of 50, you are no more than a number to the majority of postal workers. I don't think anyone at my post office would notice if I died, why should they notice which catalogs I order.
