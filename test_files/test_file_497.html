    If i had a package delivered to an undeliverable address ( yeah i know rookie mistake ). would i be able to go to the Post Office with ID and ask them if they had a package for me. I have a post office in the town that i reside in. It was sent Priority Mail so i should not have to sign for the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Is this a smart / Safe idea?

    I called USPS as I'm in the same situation. As soon as packages are deemed undeliverable, they are returned to sender. If the sender didn't put a return address or if its invalid, USPS will OPEN the mail in hopes of finding a return address receipt inside or a way to contact the owner. If the packages are worth more than 10USD and can't be returned, they will be sold.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assuming you shipped narcotics or forgeries, USPS will file a police report.
