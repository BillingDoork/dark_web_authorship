    Hey!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today i received my order from a reputable vendor (he is one of the top 4% vendors)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package was really nice and really good stealth, but there was NO return address written on it. It was the second vendor i ordered from, so i dont really know whats common, but isn't that kind of suspicious?  :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks for your input

    depends on how the package looks - how much post do you get normally with/without a return addy?

    well, the vendor i used before always had a return address, and every other package i get (not related to SR) has a return address on it as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package looked really nice with good stealth. I guess this seems not to be much an issue since the vendor is in the top 4 %, but i think most packages have an return address on it, so it would still feel kind of suspicious to me, or am i wrong?

    nah i wouldn't say suspicious - i've had loads of packages from all over with no return addy - whenever i send a letter i never put a return addy on it either. think people just put them on so they look like they're from a professional company.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    bottom line - i wouldn't lose sleep over it
