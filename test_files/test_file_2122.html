    Is there anything preventing a vendor from being able to stick a dcn on an envelope, and mail it to themselves just to be able to show silk road "hey look, a dcn showing the product was delivered. don't give this douche his money back..."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or perhaps from using the dcn from a previously successful order?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm concerned because I have an order in the resolution center with a long-term trusted vendor on the road who has great stats, and I've tried to contact him but he seems to be ignoring my messages...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I lose this money it's going to be a swift kick in the balls for me.

    Yep all they would have to do is slap a dcn on an envelope and send it to and address in your zip code where it can be successfully delivered

    If you have the DCN the post office can actually confirm the address it was delivered too... I do believe.  May be mistaken.

    Ive always wondered about this myself. Im pretty sure if a vendor sent an empty package with a dcn they could use that during a resolution and it would be your word against theirs.

    Vendor got back to me today promising the situation would get resolved.

    But that sucks that this is possible.

    DCN has limited value.  It can verify the pkg was "delivered" but it will not tell you WHERE it was delivered(other than zip code)  nor TO WHOM it was delivered.  It certainly is not proof of delivery to the buyer and if the pkg gets lost in the system it only will go so far in helping you track it down.  Basically all it will tell you is where it was last scanned.  DCN is better than no DCN no doubt..but what do you expect for 75 cents?
