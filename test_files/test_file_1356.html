    Hey guys. I just reached my 50th post so Im here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I placed my first SR order last Wednesday. USPS express domestic. 1 gr coke. Today will technically be the 4th day and still no arrival. One wrong move I might have made (from listening to advice from another poster) is to misspell my first name a bit, like I was on a mass delivery sent out by a big company's computer. Don't know if that, along side being express, has raised suspicion, but I surely hope not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since its my first order and I am a complete newbie still, my paranoia is kind of high right now (thinking all the worste case scenarios here, CD, etc..).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Guess I am looking for words of wisdom from the more experienced members in this regard. Is over 4 days sketchy? Could the 1 letter misspelled in only my first name cause some suspicion?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Feedback greatly appreciated. Thanks guys

    Have you checked tracking?  I am guessing that it was not sent when the vendor said it was.  I've used fake names and misspelled names and even signed for them when receiving kilograms sent express domestic and international and never had a problem.

    Would it be a big no no to call postal center and see if they had any missed express deliveries (in case mailman forgot to leave pink slip)?

    No bro it would be fine for you to call an check. Iv called my P O  when i had a international package come in and show as deliverd, but the Post man never left a Pink slip or tried to deliver, so i called the next morning asking where the package was. I had a trackin # though
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It sounds as if the vendor has never sent your parcel, Priority mail would of already been with you by this point. Express is 2 days at very most! Unless they have tried to redeliver an now it is sitting at the p o waiting for someone to pick it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im pretty sure your the same buyer that had this issue i was posting to you about in the newbie section, you really need to get the tracking or have the vendor tell you EXACTLY what the track is saying. It sounds to me like he never sent it. Just because you miss spelled a letter or something but every single thing else on the parcel is correct it would of went to where you had it sent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Something seems way out of whack with your situation, i still dont feel it was intercepted i just think
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A. NEVER SENT
    <br/>
    B. You had it sent somewhere it could not be deliverd
    <br/>
    C. WAS attempted to be delivered an is now at the PO
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From my experiance when you call the PO , when you say im checking for mail that should of arrived they only ask 'whats the address sir?' Thats it.. Iv never even been asked for my name, Just ask me do i wanna come pick it up or just have it sent out with delivery.

    The vendor did eventually get back to me and said "it seems it was lost in transit". He offered to re-ship, minus the charge for express, or a give me a full refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I messaged him back wanting a re-ship but I wanted it to go to a different address this time, in case there were complications in that regard. I informed him of this, but have not provided the new address yet as I wanted to get feedback from him on whether this might throw up some red flags.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone think it would throw up red flags to have a re-ship to a different address? (assuming he is mailing again from the same location).

    wtf the vender gave up that fast?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ur trippin.. express can get misplaced.. MISPLACED.. but very rarely lost..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i MYSELF IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    have had an express package containing a POUND of marijuana take 5 days to get to me..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    well it came on the fifth day..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ur package might still show.. its very possible.. shit ive had 2000 dollars cash i was sending to BTCmaster
    <br/>
    go missing for 3 days..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    had to call and they eventually found it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    dont give up untill its been like a week at least.. that vender should really wait 2 before he offers anything
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but then again if he isnt giving u the tracking he might be on bs and didnt send it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just giving u some insight on what happened to me.. hope it helps bruhh :P

    Domestically, usually with Forever Strung, it takes 2 days. One time it was 3days.. With LL, usually 4-6 days because he's in Canada. Still fairly quick!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think having it reshipped to a different address would throw up red flags.

    Just to clarify here: Re-ship means the vendor ships again free of charge right? Meaning I dont have to pay for the product again correct?
