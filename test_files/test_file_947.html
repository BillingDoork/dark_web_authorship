    Everyone needs to chill out, yeah sometimes packages get lost or you get scammed, but sometimes they just take forever!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So tell us, what's the longest you've waited for a package to arrive that eventually did arrive? 30? 40 days? How far was it traveling? :)

    I've been waiting so far this is the 13th day for a package from the UK to the US from a reliable vendor..

    I've heard that packs can take as long as 30 days from certain parts of europe to the US..

    So far my experience to the UK has been pretty good....around 7 days.......the middle east is just way too long......If I did that again...it would only be with FE......there is too much of a risk.

    Good topic though.

    Over a month, actually forgot about it.  It was from SE Asia when it was suppose to be from UK and shipped to NE US.  If I knew that I wouldn't have ordered. Still the vendor gave me a refund because the listing was misleading and very late, I didn't even ask for it.

    gotta be careful which middel east country you send it too..
    <br/>
    Some countries like United Arab Emigrates and others have death penalty available for trafficking into the country
    <br/>
    not sure about the others, but i think israel is the easiest in the middle east to send to as long as its personal amounts..

    Once it hits like day 16 I start getting a little nervous.

    Once I get to about day 21 hopes are low and frustrations rise. But I'm good at remaining calm and articulating, which definitely helps in working things out with vendors

    It's day 63 for me. I guess I win cuz mine is the longest ( ;) lol). Well, actually, after a little over a month, we decided on a reship which has yet to come. I sent a due date extension a couple days ago for another 25 days but the vendor did not get to it in time. I'm really curious as to what SR Admins will do about it. It says "99.7% positive feedback from 106 transactions" on the vendors profile though. I still have my money in escrow but I don't think I'm going to try for a refund if it doesn't come through because I want to keep my perfect stats. I just really hope it comes.

    I've been wanting to talk about this situation on the forum for so long. Thanks for reading.

    About a month I think from a normally very reliable vendor. It was domestic to and he wasn't answering his messages for most of that. Finally got it resent with loads of extras that were higher in value than the original item by some way.

    WHY would you do something like that?  Especially if you are in the US.  NL/Holland has the most scrutinized mail and you have 3 of them coming your way.  Seems a bit shady.  I can understand someone ordering a few domestically but man hope it works out for you.

      WHY would you do something like that?  Especially if you are in the US.  NL/Holland has the most scrutinized mail and you have 3 of them coming your way.  Seems a bit shady.  I can understand someone ordering a few domestically but man hope it works out for you.

    well...again..i don't know what i was thinkning to myself when ordering...but definitely it was not a good decision..i had a few orders came from EU really fast so i thought to myself hey what the heck why not try to order from NL...apperantely it was not such a good idea when i think about it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyways i ordered only 2g+3g of weed and 1g of MDMA, its been more than 16 days since the first shipment, i can say its from one of the top vendors around SR, but i still haven't got anything,...not even a love letter..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so it makes me wonder what should i do? just wait few more days and see or what?
    <br/>
    sorry if it seems newbish or paranoia but thats the situation at the moment so i thought it would be nice to hear from others...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    cheers.

    Well I would probably try to do as much research on your countries drug laws and punishments and how serious it could get.  I've heard of death penalties for people trying to bring it a couple grams of whatever or just being caught with it in the middle east.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully you are in one of the more lax countries for drugs and they don't fucking kill you for some personal drug use.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the punishments are worse, I would seriously recommend you clean your house and destroy everything drug related even shit on your computer for a long time and not until your shit comes in the mail and even after it comes.
    <br/>

    Hope it works out bro.

    Still waiting for package from NL&gt;UK, 11 days!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seen on some other pill vendors page that it took 9 days NL&gt;UK and 14 days NL&gt;UK but should I panic yet? We had bank holiday and some postal strikes I believe recently so maybe some backlog.

    A popular GHB vendor took so long I had to extend the auto finalize thing, but I was warned well in advance and his packaging is amazing!

    I wish there was separate threads on this subject for USA domestic and International all round.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my case I am not sure if it is because of the mother's day holiday or whatnot but I am still waiting on my domestic order to arrive (priority mail) from a very well-known vendor here on SR. My last order came in within 2-3 business days but today happens to be the 5th business day and still NOTHING. Really upset because I also placed an order on the 10th-shipped out on the 10th (same day-thank you) and received it on the 13th. In another words I placed the order on Fri and got it Monday (priority mail envelope).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I be worried or is this due to the fact of the residual back-up from the mother's day?
