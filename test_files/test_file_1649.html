    What do you guys think about private mail forwarding services?
    <br/>
    Does anyone use them?
    <br/>
    This way vendors will never have your real address which takes away the risk of them Saving info
    <br/>
    However that is 1 more pair of hands it goes through but it would make it more anonymous wouldn't it?
    <br/>
    Ideas?

    I think he means you give your name and the address of the place, and they hold it for you, I believe. It's similar to a PO Box but it doesn't require the same information I'm guessing.

    There are mail forwarding services that accept your mail and then forward that mail to you by reshipping it to the address you give them. In my experience they're very expensive; $200 a month not including the extra postage.

    Well you sign up and get there shipping address which they forward your mail on good for if your traveling etc.
    <br/>
    but that way the vendor can't keep your personal details like your address and then give it to the cops if they get busted also if your package gets intercepted in customs there's no address to flag?
    <br/>
    Thought it seemed like a good way to keep you a little bit more anoynomus!
    <br/>
    That's for the replys guys
