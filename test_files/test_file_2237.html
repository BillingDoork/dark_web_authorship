    Hello guys. I am buying 18 bitcoins to order .25 of meth (never tried) and 0.5 of heroin. The total on MtGox is 145$. I want to do a bank wire to transfer my money to MtGox, I was wondering what is the fee on a bank wire that is international?
    <br/>
    I am sending money from canada - japan.

    Hi Vendettent,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whilst I can't help you out with your question, for purchasing Bitcoin I would recommend www.candianbitcoins.com as you're in Canada. Excellent company to deal with, very helpful, very communicative, and excellent rates.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could also use www.cavirtex.com, a Canadian Bitcoin exchange, though I have not dealt with Cavirtex myself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're still planning on using Mt.Gox don't access it via Tor as they'll flag your account under their Anti-Money Laundering / Know Your Customer requirements and you'll have to send them identification in order to verify your account and withdraw your Bitcoin.
    <br/>
