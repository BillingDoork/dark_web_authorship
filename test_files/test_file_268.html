    Hey guys, jut wanted to ask... Is it common for you that when you order mdma pills, it takes waaaay longer than usual? Ive received different lsd/other stuff orders in like 8-12 days, and for the mdma pills, i have 3 different orders (the first one placed ONE month ago to chemical brothers) and none of them came.
    <br/>
    So, well, just wanted to know if its common that this product takes a bit longer to arrive.

    Well shipping depends on where you live where the vendor ships from and how long it takes for the vendor to get your order in the mail.
    <br/>
    Try and find the vendor closest to you and use priority shipping when you can.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have noticed a lot of X vendors on here to be slow to to get orders in to transit, But that no reason for you to be waiting over a month for an order. I hope you didn't FE on any of these orders.

    Our stock just got ROCKED! But if you live in the US, our turn-around time and shipping times are quite swift - 3 days MAX to anywhere in the US. We also offer an Overnight Express option. Hopefully we'll be back in stock today, but (again, if you're in the US) we got you in the future :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other than that... as the previous poster mentioned, try to find someone as close to you as possible in your price range and that'll help I'm sure.
