    You shouldn't have any issues on the SilkRoad with race. Vendors don't care about the color of there clients skin as long as you pay the bitcoins you get your merchandise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been a SilkRoad Member for a little over 6 months now and I have never seen any instances of racism from vendors or any reports of vendor racism on the forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But with that said always research your vendor before you make a purchase and you should be fine and Welcome to the Silk Road :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kind Regards

    haha..  man.  that would suck.  vendor decide to write the address in crayon and sprinkle some coke on the outside of your package -cause he seen it was going to some guy named Trayvon Black, in Bronx New York.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    on a side note, i know some cool urban black people who are psychonauts, though they don't use the term. there's a scene specifically in bay area and cali.

    The only names I have on my list are as follows -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ben Affleck - Because he is fucking annoying
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Jenifer Lopez - Because she never gets her arse out
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Gordon Brown - He let me down and I don't like people with glass eyes
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ed Balls - Because he is a slimy cunt.

    I guess race does matter to you-----I am not sure I give it a single thought---at any time during the day!  The only time I think or see race is when I watch 11oclock news--and its not always the best presentation:{
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dude----I do not think there is a vendor on here that would fuck with you cause of your name, or an implication of your name presenting to some stranger your color!!!   Who the fuck cares---most of us are here for the same general thing!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although you could not pay me a million dollars to eat acid in the hood!!!!!!!!!  Weird shit always happens and ONLY happens while tripping, and I imagine that experience might not be the best in a place I feel unsafe-----but thats me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck man----if your in the hood-----get the fuck out of it------plenty of opportunity in this world---you just got to want it, and go get it!!!
