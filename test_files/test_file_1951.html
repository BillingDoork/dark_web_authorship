    Hey guys I'm getting ready to use SR for my firs time here just wonder how you got over the fears of sending stuff through the mail?  A friend of mine has already gotten a bunch of weed from here through the mail from here so I'm pretty sure I want to go through with it.   In the state I am in weed is only a minor misdemeanor if it is under 100gs but I was wondering if in the US federal law will make it a felony even for personal amounts through the mail.  Also, is this more of a as long as you choose a good seller and don't give fake shipping information it's fairly low risk type thing or is this more of a taking a big chance no matter how well packaged it is type thing?

    Do your research on the seller, if the packaging is good and your details real, I believe the success rate is over 96%.

    My personal experience anyway with well over 100 transactions.

    Ok, thanks for the help tea_drinker.  Also I'm moving to a new apartment should I wait until a bit after I move in to order any thing?  And does anyone have any experience with a vendor called anonymart? I am thinking from ordering from them.

    One thing you need to remember is that what we're doing is illegal and therefore it still bares the relevant risks. Using a reputable vendor will decrease the risks as the product will be properly packaged etc. if you follow the advice all over the forums then the risk is reduced

    Anything to do with mail is a FEDERAL CRIME!!!! that's where u as a seller would determine if the buyer/money is worth the RISK!!! just read up and what i always tell everyone is if there 1 ounce of doubt.. DONT DO IT !!!

    Right now your biggest concern should be considering Anonymart in the first place. Do NOT order from him, unless you want to wait 1-3 weeks. There are talks of him being a selective scammer, but it simply isn't worth the risk and wait. People have actually left feedback complaining of problems with LE because of his packaging. There are dozens of awesome cannabis vendors with better rep, and use priority/first class (2-4 days) so why put up with the stress and wait? Good luck.

    Thanks for the help guys!  I'm thinking I might not place an order actually.  If it's considered Drug Trafficking in the US to get even a small amount of weed in the mail I might just see if I can find some solid connects where I am moving since possession is only a minor misdemeanor here.  I really don't see for the gov can have such a wide variance in their penalties for personal use.  Still hard to justify risking a Trafficking charge when I could just get off with a max 100$ fine if caught with it in my possession.  I just wish the weed here was as good as on here.  You can get hash or hash oils around here either.
