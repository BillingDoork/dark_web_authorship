    I placed an order. I didn't put in my address at first but a couple days later sent the address in a msg to the vendor. A couple hours later the status of my order changed from processing, to "in Transit" so I was thinking, "Goody he's mailed it" however when I checked to see whether he had read my message with the address the msg is marked unread. Now it's been a couple of days and the message is still marked unread. Is this normal practice ? Should I email the vendor and ask what is going on ? Unless he's psychic or SR msging made a mistake there's no way the package is in the mail...  ??? and it's going to autofinalize 17 days after he put it "in transit." Is this normal ?

    i don't really know much about how the "unread" thing works but ill just throw this in - take it for what its worth:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    today i sent a message (9 hours ago to be exact) and 2 hours ago i got a reply to the message.  given the reply it was obvious that the vendor had opened and read my message, but the message i sent was (and still is) in black bold font in my "sent" folder, which is supposed to mean he hasn't opened it, but it is wrong!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my only guess is that maybe there is a delay in the SR system updating that the message has indeed been open.  he sent the reply 2 hours ago, meaning that he opened and read my message somewhere between 9 and 2 hours ago.  i bet by the morning it will be marked as read, but i don't know, maybe sometimes there is an error and it never shows up as having been read even when it has.

    Interesting, thanks. I didn't know the messaging system left stuff saying unread.

    When you commit to buy items, there is a field to input your address. Why did you not use this standard feature?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you used the normal procedure, the vendor would have received the order with your address, to mark in transit. The vendor is probably experiencing alot of PM's and orders. This is why the address field is there when you buy an item.

    I know I should have, I was figuring out the PGP thing at the time (trying to get it set up and I didn't know how it worked) though and I wasn't sure if PGP meant that I was supposed to email him or what. (I'd also asked a couple questions and was hoping for a response from him.)

    Are you guys sure that the bold doesn't mean that you haven't clicked on the sent message yourself?

    When a vendor uses the "Bulk Reply" option, the message still appears as unread in your sent messages folder.
    <br/>
    Therefore it's very possible that the package is indeed in transit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Auto-finalize is set to 17 days after the vendor marks the package in transit. This is the case for all orders on the site. If it still has not arrived after about 13 days, put the item into resolution requesting a time extension of 5 days. It annoys vendors no end when a person puts the item into resolution a couple of hours before auto-finalization.
    <br/>
    If you ask for an extension of 5 days, this means that the item will next be seen by an SR Administrator 22 days after the item was put in transit (the time extension begins after the auto-finalize period expires). It will not auto-finalize once in the resolution center, but you will have the option to finalize at any time if you do receive your package. If your package does not arrive within a reasonable time period and / or repeated time extensions (I always give it up to a month), you can then request a refund of X % in the resolution center.
    <br/>
    The 'resolve' option becomes available 10 days after the vendor marks the item as 'in transit'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note that your buyer stats will be affected if you let an item auto-finalize, or if you are issued a refund.
