    Being pulled over by a cop soley depends on your driving ability and whether he bust you or not depends on how smoothly you can talk and assert your rights politely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's no honest way to compare this stuff in numbers because a large portion of whether you get caught or not depends on how discreet and clever your vendor is with his packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I honestly think SR is safer, or else I wouldn't have been able to buy the pounds of illegal substances that I have on here. Plus you don't have to risk going to someone sketchy who could rob you, or risk driving with such a large amount.

    If you do personal amounts and domestic only, then your chances are extremely slim of getting caught compared to buying on the street. On SR you have layers of security and on the street you don't really have any.

    I'd like to think we are much, much safer. I'm not aware of any real documentation on the specific percentages...But, if you think about how many people in your life who have been 'caught' versus how many posts on here you see about people getting caught, it might help paint a picture for you. Good luck with your travels down the Silk Road.

    As long as its personal amounts and you use solid vendors and embrace PGP and dont cut corners then you will be fine and the chances are far better you'd get caught on the street.  On the street its always the dealers who sell in grams and eigths that are first to disappear and either take their charges or walk and drop the name(s) of the bigger fish.  That's why SR is great especially if you're the type of buyer who wants small amounts, and honestly, some of the bulk prices on here are better than what it would be on the street, depending of course on the item and what your street connects charge.

    The exact answer to your question is:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have XX.XX % chance of getting done by XXXX XXXX, balanced against XXXXXXX XXXX which will yeild a %age of around XX.XX.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the best tip is to XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXX XXX XXX XXXXXXXX, failing that you can always XXXXXX XXXXX!!!!

    Jim, your explanation is spot on.:) All I'd say is that as members of the SR community, we need to ensure we tidy our own back yards, meaning"tightening things up"which are within our control, such as PGP, Truecrypt, buying Bitcoins or anything related to staying safe and anonymous on SR, instead of speculating on what might or might not happen in situations which are out of our control. Safety is PARAMOUNT.

    SR when used for personal amounts, and most definitely domestic shipments, is a lot safer than street dealing in my opinion. Way too much to worry about when meeting up to buy something.. Local cops care about this type of dealing, but federal agents generally don't pursue lowly minor drug possession. This is all depends on your country of course, but for me in Canada, I've never felt safer buying illicit substances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always eb as safe as possible as others mentioned, don't be paranoid, but don't feel too comfortable either.

    Jim, it's still fresh in my mind like it only happened yesterday. :( It should serve as a constant reminder to all of us who at times, may take for granted this hidden gem and all that it stands for. It can be very easy to get caught up in all the "website politics," where things such as rifts between vendors and buyers emerge, someone speculating on the whereabouts of someone else as they may not have logged on for a few days or some heated debate over who has the best gear at the moment, but in doing this, one can inadvertently take their eye off the ball and perhaps make a crucial mistake which they wouldn't ordinarily do. To me, it's crucial that none of us become complacent. You can never be too safe. :)

    id say silkroad is far safer, there are layers of technology protecting us, like tor, bitcoin, pgp, coin tumblers the list goes on and on, if you really thnk it though, as long as you stick to the recommended  guild lines as detailed on the main site you should be bullet proof as a buyer, like it says on the site anybody can send anybody anything in the post and just because a item turns up at my door dont mean i ordered it or requested it, if you followed the guild lines on getting coins there will be no way to prove you had anything to do with it turning up, and the law is all about innocent until proven guilty, but if your scoring of a street corner and a pig drives round the corner or pulled over with a pocket full of drugs, you have been court red handed so you are guilty. plus after my experiences and pure quality of the drugs ive sourced here i would never go back to a street dealer again, my eyes have been opened to the fact there is better out there than the shit my local dealers get then cut more, silkroad is changing the world slowly but surely, as more climb aboard it will only get stronger and more popular, the law can try as they like but the simple truth is there are more of us than them they will never win this fight in the long run, people deserve the right of freedom of choice, its my body and i can do what the fuck i like with it and anyone who tells me any different can go fuck a duck lol

    First thing i would learn if i was you is protecting myself on the internet by using vpn's that don't save logs, remote desktops, and encrypted IM's.
    <br/>
    TOR saves your ip addresse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next is taking cabs more often, this way they won't seize your car... Also you can always deny when taking cabs.  ;)

    I really think it's safer on SR, i have a friend who is selling weed IRL and he get fucked by police last week, if you buy personal amounts of drugs it's pretty safe. There is no phone call to intercept, no text message, everything is encrypted so it's pretty hard for LE to figure that you an honest worker are buying drugs on the internet  ;)

    Many people here test the product first by administering it in very low doses to ensure it's the chemical they believed it was. I advise this route when getting non-pharmaceutical products; even if the buyer is a trusted source.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my own opinion and experience, SR is a lot safer. I feel veeeerrry safe ordering domestic especially. The only thing you gotta worry about with domestic orders, is a postal worker or neighbour stealing your package, or a misdelivery to the wrong address (These problems are also a possibility with international orders as well, obviously).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do research here on the forums and check out the wiki. You should wait until you're comfortable when you order.
