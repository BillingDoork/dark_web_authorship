    I looked up and JFk and other airports in Ny, Nj NH and Cn. were down i am not sure the days, but does this mean no flights no customs? I am waiting on something and it just today posted as arriving in states after 6 days!!Â  Please any one with any further info or more in detail i think it will be good for the road to know! i see it says as of now they have like a foot but are resuming mail.
    <br/>
    So anyone know how long it was down? is customs effected, backed up....ect?
    <br/>
    any and all info would be great
    <br/>
    thank you in advance the road appreciates it, especially once its up and running
    <br/>
