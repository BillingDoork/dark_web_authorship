    I ordered a tab week and shipped first class letter on monday. It's day six and no arrival. I'm starting to think I'm fucked that the name on the letter wasn't attached to apartment number and got sent back or attempt to locate the person. I used an old resident's name and didn't research properly so now I'm scared and and paranoid as hell.  Is there any hope it'll come (usa to usa btw) or did it get sent back and not to think about it anymore?  I'm really worried about getting a no knock raid or some bullshit.

    seriously? the old tenants name... first dont blame the vendor and expect a refund
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but relax, dont worry about a knock - youre not likely to get one for just a couple tabs
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what is likely though is that the old tenant is going to get your order... ever heard of mail forwarding?? (they dont forward junk mail so it means nothing you occasionally receive their mail) or it could be returned to sender
    <br/>
    <br/>
    then again, sometimes mail just takes a little longer than expected, theres a chance it may still show
    <br/>
    <br/>
    best thing to do would just be to learn from the experience

    I doubt he/she set up forwarding. I don't think anyone here does that. I think they just leave when it's time to go. So I guess a return to sender. . . ie lost and gone.

    for what it's worth, I always forwarded my address when I moved.  But if you are getting mail for this old tenant, it isn't forwarded.  6 days first class is not unheard of.  Hell, I had one take 15+, bubble mailer got damaged and was restapled by the post office.  Contents were not illicit though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway ask your vendor to checfk the delivery confirmation.  DCN is free on stamps.com for packages ("thick" envelopes &gt;3/4" and all boxes -- if they sent it as a "large" envelope which is 1/4"-3/4", DCN is not included free on stamps.com, but costs something like $.85, so they might not have bought it in that case, cheap bastards)

    It's student apartments so I don't think, out of experience, people really set up forwarding. I think in other situations perhaps but here I think people just get up and go. I don't think the average person in this situation is going to drive to the post office to forward something that may or may not come.

    youre in the us... do you understand how forwarding works?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you dont "drive to the post office to forward something that may or may not come"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you let the post office know you moved and they automatically change the address on important mail that has your name on it but is addressed to your old location, and they forward it to the new location
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and even students in housing definitely forward their mail frequently - it would be wrong to just assume no one does
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and like i said (J), just because one gets some mail for them doesnt mean they didnt set it up - only certain things qualify

    That's what I meant. you notify them somehow. usually it's filling out a form letting them know. and you're right I can't prove it either way but I've just not seen it done either by going to the post office to set up forwarding or leaving a note.

    forwarding also only works for 6 months.. so if they lived there more than 6 months ago (and had forwarded), it won't be forwarded now.  Fwd'ing happens at the sorting center I imagine, so they probably have a database entry that is set to wipe out another database entry after 6 months

    no you dont have to go to the post or leave a note - you can do it in a couple minutes online. i know many students who have done this which is why i am being so clear about trying to get you to understand your assumption students dont is incorrect
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also, J your statement it is only in effect for 6 months is also completely wrong.   for the first 12 months first class mail is forwarded. then the next 6 months mail is RTS with the new address attached for the sender to re-send. then after those 18 months the mail is just RTS as non-deliverable
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i wouldnt be talking about forwarding if it didnt apply

    Ok well my mistake. Should I be worried that he/she receives it wherever they live and freaks out?  I'd rather it get RTS than the old student see it and panic or something.

    First of all, you shouldn't have used another person's name (without him knowing that, of course).
    <br/>
    You should've taken your responsibility for ordering an illicit drug, not have put the risk on someone else, unaware of everything.
    <br/>
    That's being an asshole in the first place.
    <br/>
    By the way I don't think you should worry about him receiving it, I doubt he'd run to the police with a tab, risking to be prosecuted for that.
    <br/>
    If he did it despite this thing, I doubt the police would investigate on someone receiving 1 tab without reason.

    Yup I just moved a year ago and immediately had my mailed forwarded, it was very easy to do online. If you use an old tenants name, you're taking a chance of not receiving you're package.

    Thanks everyone for the feedback. You are right, that was uncool of me to have done that and should've manned up rather than doing what I did.  Luckily it was such a tiny amount that it's probably not worth the risk for someone to call the police and for them to actually put effort over a negligible amount of it.  Lesson is learned and will not be using any other name other than my own.  I hope everything ends up well and I hope no one thinks lesser of me. I'm trying to learn as I go here.
