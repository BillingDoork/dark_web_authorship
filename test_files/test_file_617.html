    hello all
    <br/>
    <br/>
    first time posting, ignorance at its finest.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ive been trying to read through as much as i can about shipping and have been seeing a number of competing ideas, even on the wiki pages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what are the pros and cons of shipping to yourself versus using a proxy? as i understand it if its being shipped to a residence then a real name should be used and that if sent to yourself you should make it plain as day and innocuous as possible (which in part is left to the seller's "stealthiness" and the glorious blessings of the postal gods) and even if its the real name of a proxy the same applies, but what about if its sent to a business with a great deal of already existing mail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what kind of proxies can be used? ive come up with apartments, universities, a couple businesses, a few hotels, but i dont know how to put myself in a position of plausible deniability.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'll be honest in saying i dont know what to do, im not so much concerned about the postal officers since i get along with them great as im with customs since i know anything i do buy will have to be sent internationally, their are no suppliers where i am so my primary concerned is to minimize the risk as much as i can.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    that being said i have sent some strange stuff through customs and never had anything come up, lots of envelopes of seeds (some which would have gotten me in a bit of trouble if they figured out what they were), bags full of lose powders (racetams), lots of pills (mostly vitamins) and even tree sap (copal and myrrh), but this is a different and i want to be as informed as possible on what i can do to protect myself
    <br/>
    <br/>
    everyone has to start somewhere, and this i hope is where i do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if anyone can help in anyway, or point me at something to read. (if already gone through the stickied pages from the former postal employees and about a dozen of the threads from the first three pages).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks everyone
