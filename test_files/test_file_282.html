    Hi everyone. I'd love to be making this first post about a different topic, but I'm under huge fucking pressure. Here's what happened to me:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in Eastern Europe and I ordered some stuff from China. This stuff has been intercepted by customs and they tried to make a CONTROLLED DELIVERY!!! I live in a 15 floor apartment building and the fucking cops called my apartment from downstairs through this thing called a "Apartment Building Phone" (I already knew by the tracking number that the package has been intercepted). Over this apartment building phone the fucking cop pretended to be a postal worked and  said "Are you [My name]? - I said No; Is this [Address]? - I said No and just hung up the apartment building phone and didn't open the door". I immediately looked out the window and saw 2 undercover cop cars and the entire outside filled with cops dressed in black standing at different points. After about a minute the cop that was ringing the apartment building phone, got into the apartment building and was already on my floor ringing my doorbell. Of course I didn't open.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For about 8 more hours they were sitting outside waiting for me to come out, with different cars pulling up all tinted, and the black dressed fucks roaming right outside... I left at about 3 in the morning, and went to another apartment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's been a few days now and I got rid of everything that could incriminate me. I've been roaming the city and I don't think that they are following me... But I'm not sure.... Please give me some kind of  advice and what kind of actions could they take now that all this has taken place...  Specifically I would like to know:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. If they catch me on the street and take me in and start asking all those fucked up questions - what should I say?
    <br/>
    2. Can they really pin that fucking package on me if I didn't sign for it?
    <br/>
    3.What could be their next course of action?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would really appreciate any of your input, because I'm all alone and can't talk to anyone about this.

    You are lucky that you know the package was intercepted and they are doing a controlled delivery. You should sterilize your PC and remove all drugs and incriminating evidence from your residence. If they approach you, deny everything. If they torture you, still deny everything. It's better to take an hour or two of torture than years of torture in a E. European jail.
    <br/>
    Obviously, don't sign for the package, say you are not expecting anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make sure you have a lawyer's number handy that you can call if they approach you. So if they decide to take you into the police
    <br/>
    station to interrogate you, you have a lawyer you can call. Keep us updated on what's happening.

    1) you say nothing. you dont deny anything because you have no knowledge of anything to even deny unless they have mentioned it and then you just say you know nothing and ask for a lawyer since they are accusing you of something
    <br/>
    2) no, not if you clean house and dont say anything
    <br/>
    3) they could conduct surveillance or try to re-deliver it possibly so dont do anything incriminating like go to buy locally in the open

    First, sorry you are in this predicament and you feel alone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they authorities have put in the effort, they are going to want to at least speak with you at some point.  It may be worth your while to go ahead and speak with an attorney before returning home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As others have said, you deny, deny, deny.  You do not have any contraband in your possession - they are trying to get you with it in your possession.  If you can stay with family or friends for a couple of days and then return home.  You can then tell authorities you were away visiting and have no damn clue what they are talking about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems that you are going to have to go through some shit like an interview with polios.  Just be calm, see this through and say nothing.  Remember, they have no hard evidence.  You are the only one who can give them what they need.

    Hi guys. Thank you so much for your advice. I made some good points from your posts like: have lawyer ready, don't say anything, be ready to get dragged into the fucking police station, sterilize computer. - Thank you so much for any advice as I'm really confined to myself with this problem..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's what happened just a few hours ago. I went back to my apartment to get some of my clothes. I was constantly looking outside to see what was going on outside. And I noticed an unmarked VW Polo pull up and park in this discrete spot that could see my windows a little, and all the exits from the buildings' courtyard. So, when I was leaving my building I decided to head straight for that VW Polo to see who the fuck is inside... When I stared to get relatively close to the vehicle, the passenger side door opened and a gorilla looking dude was about to get out, so I just turned the other way and swiftly walked out from the courtyard. So I'm pretty sure that they are watching me....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The question is: Why are they watching me, instead of just catching me and taking me in for questioning? Do you think they are waiting for me to slip up? How long could this last?

    I would think at this point that any normal course of action for the authorities would be to just pick you up (like in the courtyard there) and question you.  That leads me to wonder, just what and how much was the order from China?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just don't see the utility in following you around, especially after making the effort they did, not getting you but basically tipping you off.  It would not seem logical at this point.  I would still assume at some point you will be questioned, but make sure you computer is clean, as is everything else and start to resume a normal life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Talk to a lawyer though or at least have the contact info for a lawyer of your choosing at your ready.  Make that call as soon as you are contacted by authorities.

    The order was for 20G of chemicals. And with this order I was using a new supplier. I'm pretty sure that this new supplier fucked up the packaging and probably just threw in the bag with the product into the mailing envelope without any 'stealth'.  At this point I think that the cops are waiting for me to slip and try to catch me dealing with some locals.

    20 GRAMS or 20 GRAND of chemicals ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If its 20 GRAMS, this story seems implausible. Police just ask the building manager to let them up, they aren't foiled by you not buzzing them up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They just sat out there then eventually packed it in and left ? Never came back the next day ? Or the next ?

    20Grams. The first day they were obviously all over the courtyard, after trying to make the controlled delivery. The thing is that I knew that the package has been intercepted, and when they called the apartment building phone trying to make the delivery, I denied being me and just hung up the phone. There are no building managers... This is eastern europe, before they installed apartment building phones, the buildings were full of bums and shit on the staircases.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The second day they still had VW Polo parked outside. Please read my posts again, you will see the whole story. I'm 100% sure that I'm being watched, but they aren't taking me in for some reason. And I'm sure they know that I know about them.

    Whether this is legit or not (and if it is I'm sorry for you) you should consider editing your posts, too many incriminating details, you would not want to assist LE by disclosing too much, admittedly you haven't been too specific (yet) but some of what you describe here could land you in the shit, just saying...

    This is the real deal man. I'm being fucking watched by the LEOs after they tried to roll me right in my apartment, but I didn't open. Thanks for your advice. But, I doubt that our fucking redneck village LEO know about SR. And I am not being very specific also. I hope that my situation can help others avoid it, because it causes huge nervous pressure - just because you don't know what is going to happen.

    Mate if they have gone to the trouble of watching you as you claim they could very easily be on SR, never underestimate the law.

    You're going to have to behave like a political dissident in the Communist era.  You are going to have to assume that your phone and internet connection are tapped, and that your  apartment might even be bugged. You might wish to consider using a CD/DVD Linux distribution like Tails to connect on here. You might wish to use DBAN to wipe your computer's hard drive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.

    I'd like to thank you once again for the secure Linux distro. It's really nice. Right now, I'm at a hideout spot and I'm constantly looking out the window to see if there's anyone outside watching me... And it looks like they aren't checking for me at this place. I'd like to ask:

    Does anyone know of a good method to check if there is a tail on me?

    If you think they know your cell phone number, they can find your exact location via your cell phone. So to be on the safe side, you have to take out the cell phone battery, just turning the phone off is not enough. And don't just put another sim card in the old phone, they can still track you because the s/n of the phone is linked to your old SIM card.

    Best to use a new phone + new sim card.

    I'm gonna call it mate and believe me if I am wrong I am really fucking sorry but this does not sound plausible for 20 grams, you are describing a major police investigation and surveillance effort, I cannot imagine a police force anywhere with the inclination, time or care-factor to mount such an operation, if it was 20 kilos that would be different. Seriously mate, I think you are either having a major case of the noya or some seriously weird shit is going on, maybe get out of town for a few days and chill out.

    Actually I wouldn't do that right now, that would definitely look suspicious IMO, the best thing you can do is act normal, do what you usually do (except with all the drug related stuff), hang out, have a beer or something, I don't think this can last more than a week or two, it involves too much money for the LEOs, and you're not a "big target". Then you can go back to your getting high bussiness, but I don't know how you are going to do it to buy again from SR.
    <br/>
    Anyway, good luck man, I hope to read from this thread again.

    That aspect of tradecraft is, unfortunately, outside my area of expertise.  That said, I did a quick search, and found something you may find of value:

    Dude it's really easy for you to be out there in the Western world doubting my words. But this shit is real! The LEO tried to make a controlled delivery to my house man!! If I opened the door that day and signed for the package.... I'd be in the cage for 10YEARS!!!! This is fucking Eastern Europe dude, shit is real out here. If 20Grams in the West is OK and no problem, here it's considered a major operation. I came on this forum because I have no other place to seek advice, and this shit is really nerve wrecking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3r3,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the advice. But I'm leaning towards what TheBullsEye said. I think that I should behave normally. My goal is to stay away from my apartment, because I know 100% that they are watching that. What I want to find out if they are watching me move around the city ....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NightCrawler,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A lot of respect to you man. I will look into that article that you've provided and try to gain important knowledge for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FACTS:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. They intercepted my shit and tried to make a controlled delivery.
    <br/>
    2. After I didn't open and didn't accept the package my apartment has been watched (trust me it's fucking obvious how they do it).
    <br/>
    3. I'm located at a different place, behaving normally, but staying low (not talking to anyone I know, and not making any moves to get anything to smoke)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    RHETORICAL QUESTIONS:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Q: Why haven't they caught me on the street and took me in for questioning?
    <br/>
    A: (My opinion): They are waiting for me to start contacting various people and get me when I got shit on me slippin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Q: How long could they continue this surveillance?
    <br/>
    A: (My opinion): For at least a month... Or they could randomly turn the heat on and off...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Q: How the fuck did they intercept my package?
    <br/>
    A: (My opinion): The new fucking RC supplier made a huge blunder and didn't use stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Q: What am I hoping for?
    <br/>
    A: (My hope) I hope that this goes away faster, and I hope for support from you guys because I have no one to talk to about this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MORAL OF THE STORY:
    <br/>

    Like I said mate if this shit is real I'm real fucking sorry for you, I've offered some advice along the way, I still think you might want to consider taking some RnR out of town if this is all going down for you, would never want to see anyone experience this kind of LE attention, hope you get clear of any hassle and nothing bad goes down.

     I'm gonna call it mate and believe me if I am wrong I am really fucking sorry but this does not sound plausible for 20 grams, you are describing a major police investigation and surveillance effort, I cannot imagine a police force anywhere with the inclination, time or care-factor to mount such an operation, if it was 20 kilos that would be different. Seriously mate, I think you are either having a major case of the noya or some seriously weird shit is going on, maybe get out of town for a few days and chill out.

    In Australia they give you a slap on the wrist for 20Grams, in china they hang you for 10Grams(not 100% fact but you get the point), i feel for you man,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i was just wondering how long have you been getting your drugs in the mail? maybe they have been keeping an eye on you for a while and are trying to catch you while or after visiting your contact so they can get him, what im saying is they might be using you to get to your bigger fish.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    with regards to your phone, just throw it away and csll your provider and tell them you lost your phone, then its not suss when you get a new number.

    I would grab a new anonymous prepaid phone and a Visa Electron prepaid debit card. You can be tracked both through your phone and any financial transactions you make that aren't in cash.
