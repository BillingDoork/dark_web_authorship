    In the event your address WAS compromised, how long would it take LE to peek inside your mail, get drug dog to sniff it, get warrant to search it, reseal it, and then attempt to resend it to you via controlled delivery? Should that severely delay the delivery process by a big number of days? A few of my packages are pretty late and I got a refund for one of them because it was unrealistic the amount of time I had been waiting, another I FE'd for didn't show either and it was a very minimal amount that fit into a white letter envelope. The original package that didn't show at first was considered a bulk order. Basically I am curious how much time I have to prepare for the controlled delivery? I haven't got any love letters or anything like that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, the address I was giving the vendors I bought from during this time period was a tad off, my city was kind of fucked up because I live on the borderline between two cities/towns/whatever, and before I had used the wrong city many times (the next city over) and still got my mail. I received a package that wasn't contraband related on june 2nd, was just from a friend and had some bracelets and shit in it. And then another I got was a sample from an NL vendor, which came rather quickly. Around 5-7 days which is quick for NL. The other stuff I had waiting exceeded 15+ days and I am on day 15 for my most current orders. The ones that should be arriving any day now, although I am hearing some people's NL to US mail is coming around 17-18 days, some even up to 30 days. I am curious if the fucked up address will actually have that much of an effect? The street address is perfect besides the city, but like I said I've had two parcels come during this time period even with an incorrect city and I forgot to add an extension to my zip code which has never mattered before. Just curious about all the factors contributing to my mail delays. :/

    thanks in advance!

    Guru is right.
    <br/>
    Always be prepared as if the LE are in on your deal at all times...
    <br/>
    ( i mean you'll obviously know if its a CD, cause the mailman will require a signature. Unless your vendor is a fucking moron and sets up your delivery for signature confirmation. )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I keep all my drugs and illegal materials in the same place, a very easily disposable crown royal bag.
    <br/>
    Its kept in my bathroom behind my toilet at all times, just incase i need to flush my stash, everything is there to be stomped and flushed.
    <br/>
    ( Except my weed, i have a medical growers card for that )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But my words of advice, never have more drugs than you can flush in one go.
    <br/>
    Being able to flush everything on the first flush leaves you ample time for multiple flushings ( So they cant plunger your shit back up so easily )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And yes, i've read/heard stories of LE using plungers after hearing toilets flush to find possible flushed narcotics .
