    I've got 500mgs of GBL from the jennifers that have read as being "Processed through Sort Facility" at "ISC NEW YORK NY" since 9/13. Today is the 25th.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm worried it got popped- would I have gotten a letter or (worse) a knock by now? I called USPS &amp; asked what was up &amp; they said they have the same info as me &amp; that it needs to be scanned again before anyone will ever know what's going on. I've extended with jennifers- they're being cool + since the cash is in escrow I'm not concerned about it. I'm just wondering if I should be worried &amp; if so then how worried should I be?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh &amp; I also have literally like 10 other orders either on transit or processing. One of which is from the Netherlands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts? Should I just chill out?

    From my recent experience with my package being seized, I would say that yours was seized as well. Rarely will USPS take that long to update a package on the website. It's done automatically when it is scanned so I am pretty it got seized. I have no idea whether you should expect a knock or what you may receive; I still haven't even heard back from mine. I did the same as you and called to see where my package was and they told me the same info over and over until I got transferred to the correct department, from where I was notified that the package was seized by federal officials due to possibility of being drug related even though it was just cash and nothing else (might've smelled like cash). Anyway, I hope this helps somewhat.

    Jennifers just messaged me and asked me to update this thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All my orders came in literally like the day after I came on here and started being paranoid. They were completely worth the wait.
