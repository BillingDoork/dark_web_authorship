    Hey everybody,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so with the way things have been lately im working on securing my safety as much as possible and would like to get a PO box in a different name.  I understand that they accept
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Valid driver's license or state non-driver's identification car",
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Armed forces, government, university, or recognized corporate identification card" for the Photo id part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone give me some advice as what is the best to go with as far as getting a fake photo id on silkroad?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know the one dude kingofspades makes pretty good drivers liscenses. Then namedeclined makes university ids, and he does them for wicked cheap.  Now im not sure im dont know much about fake ids.  But i definitely dont want any issues at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And what would be the best way to go as far as non photo identification?

    I have a spare drivers license, can the name, etc be altered, changed?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like couldn't i add another strip under the laminate, and on top of existing print, and change a few things....like everything?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Getting prints is one thing, you need something to print on plastic cards, then your set. : )

    I doubt they are all cops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm interested in this line of thinking as a part of my cash-out strategy and have done a bit of looking and thinking about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For secondary ID I would go for one of namedeclined's auto insurance or directv bills. But it needs to have the same info as the driver's license (duh). What I want to know is if and who's driver licenses are good enough to use at the post office. Also, how risky is it to use an out-of-state DL and secondary for another state? Like, if I got a banging one from the guy that just does illinois DL's could I use it safely to open a PO Box in North Carolina?

    All the shipping places that have mail boxes have the exact same requirements as the Postal Service. As a matter of fact, their requirements are DICTATED to them BY the Postal Service. Post 9/11, baby. Suck it up.

    Yea but say worst case if you got caught I think it would'nt be as big of a deal giving a business a fake id as it would usps. Seems like the post office is more cautious with everything and you could find a worker at a private place who dosent really give a shit.

    The law concerns possessing and using fake ID, not where you use it, although for mail box purposes I guess it would be federal. Not sure, but they would probably assume the federal/postal mantle to cover these other mail box companies. To be a 3rd party Postal operation that can handle/sell/mail US post they probably have to be some kind of "official" franchise and would still be considered the same as a regular post office for our purposes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good point though on the shipping office clerk being an easier target. The downside of shipping offices would be that they are much more likely to have a good camera system with full coverage of the boxes, I would think. The postal service doesn't have the budget for really decent systems or maintenance for the crap they have.

    Yep for those small ma and pop shops or UPS or Fedex they all have to fill out the same USPS form and then send it. Part of that form is collecting valid ID from the customer. Like someone else said you can make your own if you have a laser printer. There's tempates online for Florida licenses. Download the template. Next you need the right material to print on. There's a special paper(I forget the name) that you can buy that feels the same as Drivers License. Next you need a puncher to cut out the card when it's done. Also don't forget the holograms as needed. All in all if you don't have any of these things then it will cost you over $200 easily to get set up. Not the best idea unless of course you plan to be selling fake ID's on SR.

    Shit this is a pain in the ass. So many different variables.  I was planning on just paying a vender on here to make one, but yeah wtf, if he's a cop id be immediately fucked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Making my own is pretty much out of the question as far as a license, i dont think i have the know how to do that with enough confidence to use it at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I feel like there has to be someone out there who has done this with a fake id from SR. I mean when you give any vender your real name and address and there a cop its not much different than the id.

    When doing this, how do you manage to get the key for the box? I would expect you would have to go there and flash your ID to them to get your key, or have the key mailed to your house..

    I'm thinking you would have to stumble across someone elses legit ID.... if you sent them scanned documents I'm sure they would ask for it before they gave you the key?

    USPS employees are paid to question you. Mom and pop places make money off sales, and, I think, want your business enough to usually be more forgiving about the details. Also, I don't know if you can recieve FEDEX and UPS at a USPS box. A UPS box store advertizes that you can get it all there and they can message you when mail arrives (if you want them to). USPS may be getting more flexible to compete? IDK

    Yes I think it's pretty common practice not to use a USPS box but rather a UPS store or mom n pop packing store box.

    The trick still lies in the ID... as for getting someone else, sure that sounds good but you must be able to trust this person....... or try to find a nobody.

    Thats why the idea of being yourself and using someone elses lost ID might work

    Even if you get someone trustworthy to open it for you that person is still tied to you. And no matter how good of friends you are they will crack when serious prison time is hanging over their head. So this wouldnt even be an option in my book. Have to get that fake id and get it yourself, at least thats the only thing that seems smart to me.

     Thats why the idea of being yourself and using someone elses lost ID might work

    Mom and Pop shops are nice if you get after hours access and you support local business which is a cool thing to do. Do not use the post office or you could cop a charge. Have a well made fake bill too.

       Shit this is a pain in the ass. So many different variables.  I was planning on just paying a vender on here to make one, but yeah wtf, if he's a cop id be immediately fucked.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Making my own is pretty much out of the question as far as a license, i dont think i have the know how to do that with enough confidence to use it at the post office.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I feel like there has to be someone out there who has done this with a fake id from SR. I mean when you give any vender your real name and address and there a cop its not much different than the id.

      Open the mail box account online and send scans of your ID , utility bills , bank statements , I recommend the vendor "perfectscans"  :-)

     When doing this, how do you manage to get the key for the box? I would expect you would have to go there and flash your ID to them to get your key, or have the key mailed to your house..

    I've been considering my prospects lately. In regards to using a PO box attained in an anonymous fashion, I have narrowed it down to a couple options.
    <br/>
    One being the aforemention method, which would be obtaining fake credentials in order to open the acount.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems that it would be possible to use a Fake ID from out of state along with possibly forged documents from the state where your ID was issued. The story could be something like "I am taking an extended stay here in XXXXXX to take care of a relative etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think they require proof of address to be neccesarily from the same state you are appyling at.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second method would be "hiring" a street person with credentials to sign up the box in his/her name. You'll supply his/her fix with a quick hundred or two and you now have a PO box and Key under another persons name.

    I have also been looking into this as I don't want packages coming to home address, as someone else mentioned I think the fake ID way is best, as if you get someone else to open box for you, even if you pay them some money will turn you in if sh*t hit the fan and LE chased them down and threathen them with jail time!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing what I can't figure out is a way you could get the key.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have never bought anything from SR as yet, but I would imagine a lot of vendors would require a signture as proof they shipped item, if this is the case I would feel a little edgy going to pick up a drug package which required a signature from behind counter!

    Have you considered that opening a PO box with a fake ID may actually be a bigger threat to your freedom than not doing so?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We have the infamous deniability that everyone talks about around here. From what I’ve heard the deniability works. Real people have posted here about getting "love letters" instead of jail time, so I have to assume the Man knows deniability works and they don’t want to spend the money and energy going after every individual who was detected receiving a small amount of weed. But say a package was intercepted and they find out the po box holder was using a fake ID. Now they have a crime they can actually better nail you with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Real ID + busted = love letter, you stop using that po box, and continue enjoying your freedom.
    <br/>
    Fake ID + busted = you in an office, getting questioned by agents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At least that's how I play the game. But I'm no lawyer or anything.

    You might get the fake ID made to match a "drop address" you use and have them mail the key. A bit of a chicken and the egg dilemma since we are trying to come up with a drop address, lol.
    <br/>
    You might get fake ID made with a picture that kinda looks like you but is not you (found on the internet)? Then when someone else is working the counter at the store? get another box in your name near it? So you can be there and staff can get to know you for checking your real box. The Mom and Pop's might have an issue with them being there to see you too much? I think after hours access would be critical, unless it is a big or very busy place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it is a rare vendor that requires a signature. If they are too worried, they can require you FE and not promise a reship or refund unless you agree to a signature. Usually, I think they use tracking and assume you got it if the tracking shows it was delivered.
