    Sometimes i see the mail truck when I'm expecting a package and i don't have anything in my mailbox. Then later on in the afternoon i find my package sitting in my box. My questions. Do they deliver express first and then return later with regular mail on their normal route? (Do they deliver in a usps truck)

    Yes express is a whole other mail man who's job it is to deliver express packages.

    I had wondered the same thing until I ordered express and realized it wasn't even the regular mail man.

    It can come at the same time as regular mail, but usually will come at a different time.

    I once got sketched out because a priority package was delivered at the same time as an express order -- as in stacked right on top of each other an hour or two before priority should have arrived.  Now I often get regular mail with express orders and don't think anything of it; turns out they often do that for efficiency and customer service and all that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't know about the truck, but I'd assume it's the same one.  They're short on cash: why go painting a quarter of your fleet for no good reason.

    Usually it's a different fella, but can certainly be your normal mailman depending on when it got to the sorting center.

    From my experience, express mail is usually delivered in one of the bigger USPS trucks. They are roughly in between the size of a regular USPS truck and a UPS truck. Don't know if it's like that everywhere, but that's how it is around here. It usually comes an hour or two earlier than the regular USPS truck, although I'm sure that varies.

    Do they put express main in your mailbox or do they leave it at your door?  For example, I'm in a duplex community with mailbox stations down the road.  I've never received an express shipment so I'm not sure how it's handled.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've ordered things off iOffer from china and that is delivered to my door and I have to sign for it.  Everything else USPS is put in my box.

    If its express that needs to be signed for obviously they aren't going to leave it without you signing for it.

    Express always shows up in the morning before 10am-11am in a mini-van for all my drops and it's always women with them sexy postwoman cavs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sigs on express is only done if shipper requests it or I believe if you receive an order from out of the country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for dropping it in the mail box....I'm not even sure. I never tried or any of my drops has either. Don't want to take the chance of them having it in their hands for another day if they don't drop it.

    If your mail carrier's route would normally take him/her to your address before the guaranteed  delivery time then usually it will be delivered with your other mail.  If your mail usually comes late afternoon then of course, it will be delivered separately.  It's not unusual for carriers to deliver all Express mail for theirr usual route first thing..and then proceed on their regular mail route.  It wouldn't be unusual for you to see your regular carrier deliver to you twice in the same day if you had an Express pkg.  It's also not unusual to have non-postal Carriers(like a mail sorter or Supervisor, even) deliver express pks in their personal vehicles.  They'll pretty much do whatever they have to..to get Express mail delivered on time and they'll use whomever they need to to get it done.
