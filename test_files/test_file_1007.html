    So here is my situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    About a month and a half ago I ordered 50g of mdma from from a vendor out of Germany and a vial of lsd from the UK. The MDMA was ordered first. The Vial 2-3 days after. The vial arrived first...13 days after transit. The MDMA did not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Both vendors are trusted vendors with very high ratings and excellent stealth from my experience (I've used them many times before).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have not ordered any substances from SR to my place since realizing the MDMA was a no-show. However, I have not received any knocks on my door from LE or a love letter from customs. My assumption is that the package got lost and returned to sender, the mailman delivered it to the wrong location by mistake, or the vendor never sent it (He said he did -_-).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question is this: Do you think it would be safe/wise to order internationally again based on my situation?

    I'm definitely not the person to ask, but my instinct is that if you decide to order anything at all, keep it domestic for at least 2 or 3 orders before trying international again. I have no solid argument for this, just seems sensible to go domestic if you're going to do it at all.

    oldcactushand is right, domestic is unfortunately the safest way to go. I know the prices are higher but you're paying for the safety it provides.

    I'd say the same, tho it kinda depends on what you're ordering...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Little sachets of weird powder fly to me from all over the place with no issue, so far.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I still wouldn't be comfortable thinking about 50g MDMA or an ounce of weed bumping through the customs machine. Those things push stealth to it's limits.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AND USE PGP IF YOU'RE GONNA DISCUSS DETAILS WITH A VENDOR, ONE TIME I DIDN'T, AND HE GOT RIGHTFULLY PISSED...
