    I'd particularly want to ship some Modafinils and the likes.

    But I'm just not sure if customs will seize it?

    I've tried a few times (small amounts of powders).  It never arrives.  The postal workers are notorious for stealing.

    This. They're underpaid and will go through your shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, my older brother once had a camera shipped to him while he was staying in the Philippines for a month. He basically paid off the customs agent to allow him to import into the country at no cost to him (other than his bribe to the agent.)  From what he told me, there's crazy duties to import into the Philippines, so bribery is a cheaper way of getting stuff in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, would that work for illegal drugs?  Couldn't tell you. But it's something to think about.
