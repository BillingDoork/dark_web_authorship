    I'm sorry if this has been covered but on the rare event I can get TFSE to work I can't find a clear answer to my question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know you have to sign with DCN, but what about an express international order with a tracking number? I'm ordering LSD from Canada to the USA via "Xpresspost" and would like to know whether or not to sign for it if I'm asked to.

    Thanks.

    i have signed for many packages.. Only sign for it if you are expecting to sign for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in my experience in my country (maybe different in yours) Anything with tracking that is INTERNATIONAL requires a signature. Anything express that is INTERNATIONAL requires a signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    regular mail never does.. talk to your vendor.

    Mail requiring a signature is delivered at the same time as all your other mail. If your mailman is lazy and doesn't go to your door or comes while you aren't home they'll just slip a pink USPS note in your mailbox telling you to go to the office and pick it up.
