    Lol man this shit drives me insane:
    <br/>
    Come man seriously have u sent the package or just went for a scam?
    <br/>
    I am telling u honestly that i have ordered over 50 times here and never been scamed or package not deliveried.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will resolve and give a comment about your service if u don't resend me man.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bought for 133 dollars and never recived anything,... if the cought the package they would have sent me a letter or notice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    your choice if u resend or u want a bad comment that warns everybody from ur stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I sold 21 transactions and 2-3 went wrong. 2 shippings to near country's 10g. i'm sure there is atleast 1 scammer from the 2-3
    <br/>
    And now they having an attitude lol? I already refunded 10g. I'm not gonna lose money..
    <br/>
    Whats the best thing to do ? FE on all? I was thinking of refund him 50% back and some weed. But buyers with an attitude makes me so angry. we are the drugdealers , we risk or fucking lives to get quality dope. And all those nerds are having an attitude. (you can give me bad karma now i dont give a shit anymore)
    <br/>
    I only want comments from vendors.

    No, but you ARE responsible for making a serious effort with shipping and security.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Too many vendors have too lax an approach to shipping and packaging.

    This is one of the issues with vending. If you do not offer tracking then you are responsible for lost packages and if you want to be a good vendor you will offer a reship/refund. Sometimes you just gotta take a buyers word for it, and refund them and never sell to them again due to the risk of lost packages. These sorts of losses are part of vending. You could always impose a strict policy on your page and all your listings saying all buyers agree to so and so upon ordering, and state it very clearly. It may drive some buyers away, but at least you can say they agreed to finalize no matter what.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ultimately you can't just call a buyer a scammer for claiming to not receive a package. Have policies in place, and be prepared to deal with these things.

    You could ask to finalize in order to ship 100% or give a 50% refund (and 50%) reship.

    Some vendors might be selectively scamming newbies and a lot of newbies might be scamming vendors. Smart vendor would not ship first package to newbie then offer a reship and only ship a reship.

    Most countries we have a 100% sucess rate.

    <br/>
    anyone who is providing tracking noawdays is either being reckless by ordering the stickers to a connected address and risking 500 or so packages being flagged or they are buying labels and connecting however many packages it takes to exhaust a prepaid. maybe it should be the customers choice "would you like to stay super-anon and be at the mercy of the usps or have you information put into their database and have more security if something goes wrong?"

    Ha, sorry, but no. A lot of very large reputable vendors who do hundreds of transactions per week don't use tracking. I have asked some of them, and you know how many times they have ever had to even need tracking for a potential nonrecpieint? Twice... in a years period. That's nothing compared to hundreds of transactions per week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Having a simple policy in place can quickly and swiftly take care of potential scammers. If a buyer trust you as a vendor and your reputation is good then most people won't be hessitant to do business with you. Vendors who selectively scam newbies are stupid in the first place because having people say you are scamming is just as bad as being a proven scammer.

    So when a buyer leaves "bullshit never got package scammer" on your profile the SR admins are going to remove that? Ah no.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I receive my tracking from the post office when I order bulk stamps. Here is how you do it, you call ahead to a random post office you have never been to, and tell whoever runs the place "I am planning to grab X amount of priority stamps, can you make sure that I have a 400 label for each stamp." Either they will tell you no, or the manager will be fucking thrilled your spending that much money at his shitty post office he will just shove a stack of them in your hands without even counting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or order to a random apartment complex without a unit number and walk in and say "hey, you guys got my package? Yeah I use to live here blah blah blah." using stamps.com and get tracking so you know the exact day they will be coming.

      anyone who is providing tracking noawdays is either being reckless by ordering the stickers to a connected address and risking 500 or so packages being flagged or they are buying labels and connecting however many packages it takes to exhaust a prepaid. maybe it should be the customers choice "would you like to stay super-anon and be at the mercy of the usps or have you information put into their database and have more security if something goes wrong?"

     So when a buyer leaves "bullshit never got package scammer" on your profile the SR admins are going to remove that? Ah no.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And I receive my tracking from the post office when I order bulk stamps. Here is how you do it, you call ahead to a random post office you have never been to, and tell whoever runs the place "I am planning to grab X amount of priority stamps, can you make sure that I have a 400 label for each stamp." Either they will tell you no, or the manager will be fucking thrilled your spending that much money at his shitty post office he will just shove a stack of them in your hands without even counting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Or order to a random apartment complex without a unit number and walk in and say "hey, you guys got my package? Yeah I use to live here blah blah blah." using stamps.com and get tracking so you know the exact day they will be coming.

       uh no, thats why you state "buyer takes responsibility, we dont control the mail, if you dont receive your package you still must leave a 5" then if they break that get the mods on their ass. SR staff has already stated if you post reasonable policies then the buyer must follow them. its up to the free market at that point to pass on you or smear you on the forums like they do anywys.

    Not true. I have had reports of my envelopes being opened by customs and then sent along to their recipient drugs intact. If you are good at stealth then opening the letter will not reveal anything.

    I actually did not receive a package two times, the first time I really believe the vendor sent it but he wouldn't not believe me that I did not receive it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The second time I didn't even bother attempting to get a refund as the money wasn't worth raising my refund rate even more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know this happens only in extremely rare instances, and all the fucking scammers made it a huge deal to actually work with the vendor in the resolution center as so many people try to scam him.  IDK why this happened to me twice, both different addresses with legit names/currently receiving mail daily at them.
    <br/>
    The first item had an insanely high success rate, the other one came from over seas so I wasn't too surprised it didn't come through.

    I have never had any issues whatsoever (~5 dozen orders, domestic and international). You must be doing something wrong.
    <br/>
    If something went wrong, I wouldn't want to get a refund unless the vendor is specifically offering it to me. Why? Because I ordered illegal goods, basically from some guy on the darkweb that I don't know, who now has an IRL address.
    <br/>
    Also, my dealer on the streets wouldn't give me a refund either if some cop busted me around the corner.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @OP: You must state your policies very clearly on your profile. If someones trying to fuck with you, fuck them back (good) or ignore them after you have referred to your policies (better). This isn't Walmart where you can walk in with your complaints and a receipt :) At some point of the process, the buyer has to trust the vendor (and vice versa) a lot more than with a normal everyday transaction.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's just my views as a buyer, sorry for breaking your 'rule' that only vendors should reply :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
