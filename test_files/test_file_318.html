    Lol at the name, but in all seriousness, Hurricane Sandy is currently on course to mess up a lot of the NE.  Probably knock out a lot of power and could disrupt shipping.  Just making sure you aware if you are shipping to/from the NE as there could be delays.  Supposed to be hitting there in next 24-48hrs.  Then again it could just blow out to sea, ya never know..

    I'm SOOO glad I bought bulk to ride out the storm.  I can handle a power outage but not without quality weed!!!  I would hold off on ANY orders to the East Coast as a vendor.  This storm is supposed to be the worst in 100 yrs.  I've lived in the Tri-state area for many years.  It's only the last two years we EVER had so many hurricanes.  With the election coming I'm quite certain the term "Order out of Chaos" will be applied to this impending situation.

    Well, I'm about 30 minutes from D.C. and 45 min. from Baltimore and the mailman just delivered the mail around 5:30pm, was very late but he still delivered. USPS is running like normal in my area, you can also call their national employee hotline to check to see about any service interruptions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One thing about USPS is that they keep running through it all and only shutdown certain areas if they literally can't get to them.

    I'm not sure to be honest, I know Fedex handles priority and express package shipping for USPS so I'm unsure how those packages are going to be effected. I imagine USPS is doing everything they can to get em to us though. I have 1 Express package I'm tracking to see what route it's going to take to get here.

    Just an update for all the eastcoasters...I received both of my USPS Express packages today (a day late) so Fedex has resumed flights to most East Coast airports (Fedex does the transportation for USPS when it comes to priority and express packages). I believe that New York's airport is still not accepting flights, but almost all the other airports effected by hurricane Sandy should be transporting mail again.

    The mail should be on track, both of my packages were at a stand still while Fedex suspended their USPS package transportation to the major airports but now that they have resumed it looks like most areas are getting mail at their normal rate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm close to D.C. and Baltimore and we got some heavy rain and wind but nothing to serious...and mail wise my packages were only delayed by 1 day. People talk a lot of shit about USPS but USPS is damn good about still operating/delivering during major storms.

    Yeah man, I live next to a major sorting center and a major airport so I always get my packages really fast and I can't remember the last time I had a lost package from USPS. The 2 packages I were waiting on were only delayed by 1 day during the hurricane but as soon as they hit my postal office they had workers immediately bringing them to my house!

    I wouldn't worry about it, they've done a pretty good job of getting everything back to normal shipping times since the hurricane...your package probably won't be delayed that much (except for maybe the regular times where customs can sometimes take forever to process a package...but that's normal). The packages I have ordered from Asia usually reach me on the East Coast in about 3 weeks...sometimes less.
