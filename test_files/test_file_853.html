    I still see a bunch of vendors who promise that they have a DCN on each package. However, DCN's don't actually exist anymore, and the system kinda changed a couple months ago. So do I assume that these vendors have adopted the new tracking method and are just not calling it by the new name (which I think is USPS Tracking?)? Or do I assume that they are out of touch and maybe not using tracking anymore? Or maybe they just don't update their vendor pages often (which is still indicative of something)? Am I overthinking this? Or is the devil in the details?

    Details are very very important. I sampled many vendors with my buyer account and some of the "stealth" was shocking. Research well and quiz the vendor about his/her practices. Use your street sense and if something doesn't seem right = don't order. Shop with your head not your wallet. Safety first &gt; always!

    Just about every good vendor I know is on point when it comes to the new USPS standards. They have either updated their listings, their profile, or done what is needed to update the status.  I'm not sure which vendors you are referring to but I'm sure there are some. It's been a while now since the shipping changed. If a vendor doesn't care enough to update their profiles it's hard to trust that they care enough at all.  With so many excellent vendors why deal with a reckless one?

    Many people are familiar with "DCN" and since DCN basically become full tracking many people assume it is the same thing.  USPS now refers to both terms synonymously but prefers the more accurate term "tracking."
