    What's up people - I have a question for the community.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have recently ordered a fake ID on SR from a trusted seller. Order placed, ID made and shipped, however, no sign of it in the mail. I am pretty sure the order was actually shipped, but it went missing on its way to me. I have had a few dozen packages delivered to the same address without any issues, this one was never delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, what worries me is that the ID obviously has my picture on it. Since I am not sure if it just got lost or might have gotten in the wrong hands, I want to make sure that I understand the following.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) What is the worst that can happen? How serious can the situation get?
    <br/>
    2) How to prepare for an unwanted knock on the door? What to say?
    <br/>
    3) Should I assume that my mail is now monitored?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Given that it's not just a regular package, but a falsified state ID with my face on it, I can't just deny that it's mine, and say that someone sent it to me by accident. I am also a good few years over 21, so can't say I needed it to do underage stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd like to take this seriously, hit me with scenarios and solutions, better freak out and then prepare for the worst than not to count with possible outcomes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you.

    Don't say anything, ask your lawyer if it's best to make a case that someone tried to set you up. Get rid of all or any evidence that you might have made a purchase. If they can't prove you purchased it you might as well have been set up, right? I mean, you could do the same to someone else and why should they get busted for it?

    How the fuck is a fake ID going to be intercepted in the mail? seriously mail does not just 'go missing', if it was by some astounding unlikely scenario lost by the postal service it will hardly end up in the hands of LE. All this talk of lost shipments are as a general rule not anything to do with the postal service, they are either never sent or in a small number of cases intercepted by customs when crossing international boarders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you sure it was sent to the correct address??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you SURE it was actually sent? do you have tracking??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are using that address for other illegal activity i.e. having drugs sent there then it is conceivable your address has been compromised and anything sent there may (that's a very big may) be being checked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I doubt it was ever sent mate.

    Even in the worse case, I would stay calm the authorities would still have to prove beyond reasonable doubt a crime was committed.  It would be fairly easy for person to get someone they did not like picture/likeness make up a fake ID and send it to them.  And then alert the authorities about the address.

    I believe using that defense would only be more incriminating. There's a 99% chance if you got caught like that it wasn't a tip-off, and they found the lead on their own. To claim it's a setup seems pretty difficult to me. Unless you can prove, or make it seem probable that you have no knowledge of the package in question, then your best bet would probably be to accept ownership but convince a jury it was intended for something mild (like getting into a nightclub you're banned from) or something.
    <br/>
    I imagine it would be pretty much the same situation with drugs where you'd have to convince them it's just for personal use.. even if it really is.
    <br/>
    But I've got no idea. Like everyone says; if you get caught, stay silent and let the lawyer do his job if needed.

    No, you would not ever suggest something like that to the police.  You should "SAY NOTHING" and "ADMIT TO NOTHING" but be polite if questioned by them about anything, every time.  Thank you for replying to my post because I did not make that as clear as I should of in my previous post.  Many people try to suggest things like that to police and this leads them down a road of admitting to things you should never admit to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always tell them at this point you would like to consult an attorney.  If they try to scare you with handcuffs and a trip to county do not cave into the fear of being detained!!!  Bubba will likely not rape you in county detention.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A competent attorney in a grand jury hearing or court case could instill reasonable doubt with this defense:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What party created this ID?  -Probably unknown because of the anonymity with TOR and SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does the prosecutor have any evidence of the client entering into an "illegal contract" with some still unknown party to obtain the questionable document?  -Probably no as well, being as it is so hard to trace bitcoin transactions.  Even if you used your own dwolla account in your name linked to your bank account and used MT. gox again in your real name to buy bitcoins very recently the prosecutor probably does not have the time, resources or the knowledge to even bring this to the attention of the court.  Even if they did they likely would not have an unencrypted email saying I will pay 10 bitcoins for a fake AZ license.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok, so you have a suspected forged ID with my clients picture on it, you do not know who created it and you have no proof of my client purchasing/paying and thus entering into an illegal contract to obtain the document in question.  So Mr. Prosecutor what would stop someone from downloading your own picture on the county website creating at first glance a very passable counterfeit ID with readily available computer software?  Sending it to your home or office and thus putting you in the exact same situation as my client.  Nothing!

    i dont understand all these responses, before anything they probably don't even have it.  Then do you really think they are going to scan the face, match it to you and pursue you when thousands of teens uses these daily ?
