    Recently I set up a P.O box in the town next to me for the purpose of ordering SR packages, and I am beginning to worry that I may have made a mistake. Exactly one week ago I placed an order from canada to my PO box in Eastern U.S The order was marked in transit last thurs. That means the package had thurs fri sat mon and most of tues to get here. It's not a very incriminating amount either so i dont believe it would have been confiscated. My fear is that I wrote my address down wrong on the address sheet. The example address that the Post office gave me was:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    john doe
    <br/>
    P.O box 542
    <br/>
    littletown,littlestate
    <br/>
    50129
    <br/>
    U.S.A
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is exactly how i filled out my address form on SR. I'm starting to worry that i was supposed to put the street address of the post office on the address form as well. Do you think this may cause my package to get lost in transit? The example address form i was given doesn't say to put the street address down. Hopefully I am just being paranoid and i will receive my package within the next day or two. would anyone like to sshare their insight and ease my troubled mind?

    You never have to have the street address of your post office for a PO box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Post code and suburb are enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If that addy you posted was the exact addy used, i'd delete it now. ;)
