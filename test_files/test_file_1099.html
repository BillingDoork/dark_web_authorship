    As the post states, I used Tor to check tracking using the tracking site "17 track." Did I screw up and now shipment will get flagged?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Someone told me that doing this would automatically have my order flagged (using Tor to check shipping) and now I'm a little concerned.
    <br/>

    Thanks for the info!

    I would suspect you are safe.  For one, my understanding is that 17track works as a proxy for checking EMS packages.  Secondly I don't think EMS really cares that much.  It's not domestic and I highly doubt EMS has either the time or effort to both check for requests from TOR addresses and contact US customs.  Nevertheless it would be solid practice to leave your stash with a friend till it arrives safely.

    I have tested it a few times on legit packs of weird shit I buy on ebay from weird Asian countries. None of them appeared to have any additional scrutiny on them. I suspect its a good practice to not do such things, as if they were suspicious of you or your pack, it would not be hard to tie the tracking to tor if someone went looking. I doubt its automated.
