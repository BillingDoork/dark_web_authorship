    Hello SR Community,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I recently tracked a package on the USPS site from my computer on a residential WIFI network. Now, it looks like the package has been held up at the PO. My question is, should I be worried that I tracked the package on my computer, considering I tracked it in a different state than where the package was going and there was a different name on the package. Can USPS or LEO tell that I tracked the package and from where, if I tracked it through clear net (not through Tor).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again, my name is not on the package, I tracked it from another state, and I tracked it on a computer and not my phone. I am just wondering if someone will come knocking on my door for this. The package definitely qualified for a Controlled Delivery, but I don't think that they would really have enough evidence to come knocking at MY door (but rather the owner of the address on the package), even if they could tell where the IP address was that I tracked the package from. Should I be concerned? If there is a way for them to look up the IP address that I tracked the package from, is there a way to change my IP address on a Mac and hide myself?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any valuable insight to this will be SO appreciated!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best,
    <br/>
    <br/>

    I don't really have anything to base this on, but if it really is prepping for a CD or swat assault on delivery address or whatever they do, I don't think it was because someone noticed it was being tracked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason tracking is available is so you can track it.  I would guess that a large percentage of trackable packages are checked at least once, if not more than once, either by the vendor (in SR cases) or by the recipient (in real life).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I cannot believe someone wrote some computer program or watches an influx of package tracking notices and says, ohhhhh Bob Jones checked the status of his package, IT MUST BE DRUGS SHIT SHIT CALL THE 5-0.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry if it really is seized or CD or anything is amiss, but I think it's irrational to jump to the conclusion that it was because you checked on tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I don't really know much about how the clear and dark web compare or how they work really (despite being in a computer-related field).  However, I feel like I've read here before that you're *supposed* to check tracking NOT on tor.  Like, doing so would somehow communicate your IP or something by doing so and ruin whatever anonymity you've thus far achieved by using tor. Someone please correct me or elaborate - now I'm curious.  But I'm pretty sure exactly what you did was both innocuous, and the correct way to do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck!

    The paranoid answer is yah.  If an investigation ensued, at some point they might check IPs of when/where it was tracked from.  Is it worth their time to do so?  That probably depends on how many drugs were in the package, and if they can get other more substantive evidence.  If we're talking about a gram of mdma or something, I would just deny deny deny.  And never order drugs again.  And don't be an idiot and track your drugs from the clearnet.  Come on son.

    Isn't tracking from clearnet the only way you're supposed to track it? I heard that tracking from Tor just raises red flags. It was not a small amount and I definitely think that they would attempt a CD on the owner of that address. Fortunately, I am not the owner of that address and I am in another state. My main concern here is, if they can trace the IPs that tracked the package, is that enough evidence for them to come knocking on my door or make an arrest? I am in another state and it was not tracked from a phone or anything; it was tracked from a residential Wifi network, but I am not even on the lease. It just seems like they would mainly try to focus on the owner of the address and they wouldn't have enough evidence to bother with the location of the IP that I tracked it from. Also, I was not the only one to track it. It was tracked from several other IPs in different states. Do you think I will be OK here?

    Also, does anyone know how I could change my public IP address or something like that, so that they wouldn't be able to trace it back to my location if they tried? Does anyone have any good suggestions on how I should handle my situation. My house is clean already. Is there anything else that I can do to cover my tracks and stay safe?

    I highly doubt that any tracking checks raises any kind of flags automatically, UNLESS there is an ongoing investigation already and someone is monitoring this.  I just don't see how some agency would possibly have the time or justification to investigate every item that gets tracked from some random IP.  Plus tor nodes are not exclusively for tor, those IPs likely get used for other things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The point of not checking tracking from your own IP is so that if something happens later, there is no evidence of your IP address checking the tracking.   Plus I dont think it is hard evidence because it could just be your neighbor hacked ur wifi was using your name and addy.

    I drive no less than 50 miles away from my home. I then wardrive until I find a open wifi connection. I then connected to tor via my VPN. Then connect to another VPN via the VPN via tor. I then access usps track and confirm via hidemyass.com

    What do you want to bet his first hop VPN is a honeypot and he actually has no security at all lol?  Please nobody take his post seriously lol.  VPN -&gt; TOR is simply dumb, unless you are running the VPN box yourself and have a camera covering its access.

    We have to assume the worst, but honestly I don't think USPS keeps track of all the IPs that track each tracking number.  That's a massive amount of data and USPS cares about keeping their system very responsive.  I've also never seen any evidence that suggests they are tracking the IPs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But again you have to assume the worst.

    They aren't going to hold up a package because it was tracked though.
