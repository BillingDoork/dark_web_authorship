    How long are 1st class packages from domestic vendors taking to arrive at the moment with the mail system being clogged since it's Christmas season?  I've never ordered from SR during the Christmas period before so just wondering what to expect.  2 days or more?  Or is everything still arriving next day typically?

    I had three orders marked in transit on monday afternoon, two were from vendors I've had next day service from before neither of which have arrived yet. The third was from a new vendor whose package was delivered yesterday. I'm thinking RM is going to suck until next year.

    Of 5 orders placed since weekend
    <br/>
    - one arrived next day
    <br/>
    - one took 2 days
    <br/>
    - still waiting for 2 which were posted on Monday
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think it's just going to gradually get slower and slower. Snow isn't helping matters either just now.

    Cheers for the input guys, seems like delivery times can vary a lot this time of year from what you guys are saying.  Some of my domestic orders arrived just now so I thought I'd update.  One order took 2 days (usually stuff from this vendor comes next day) but the other surprisingly came next day after being sent.  I definitely think the situation will get worse in the next few weeks so I will try to order all my Chrimbo stash now while things are still running somewhat smoothly at my end.

    So I replied here earlier but it's not showing up. I basically said I'd still not received 2 packages shipped on Monday, and that I'd received an order that had actually shipped later. I then went to PM the vendors on SR and literally 2 seconds after hitting go on the PM, my girlfriend heard the postman bring a second delivery. We pretty much never get second post, so RM appear to be changing things up and being slow, but everything has arrived now. Good times.

    Yeah, RM must be shit house at the moment...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ordered 2 parcels from a very trusted vendor... 1 was meant to be here last Monday (start of this week)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I had another package I received yesterday different vendor but placed his order later than the above - :(

    The paranoia grows, I'm just hoping they're there when I get home....

    I've been waiting on one since tuesday and on wednesday. The wednesday one is one of the best domestic vendors out there. I'd be paranoid except I received a half ounce yesterday  ( had to sign for it at post office)

    I ordered a big order from one of the top rated UK vendors last wednesday and received a message later that evening that my order had been shipped.
    <br/>
    On monday, it still has not arrived, and honestly, i´m getting a little uncomfortable.
    <br/>
    I´m not very familiar with the inner workings of the royal mail or their delivery times over the holidays, but the last time I ordered, it was shipped on thursday and arrived on saturday morning.
    <br/>
    Anyone know what´s going on at the RM?

    I'm awaiting for 1 domestic 1st class marked as shipped on the 8th after 12 o'clock. It was POST RESTANTE.

    And still waiting for one from Singapore, I think it's 6th or 7th day so far. But for Singapore that's a normal situation.
    <br/>
    One from Belgium I received in 5 days. This one is interesting. It was a Methylone, but on the silver packaging there was a small printed label "Lactic Acid" or something like that and a CAS number so I asked a question is it right stuff inside, I wouldn't mind to try a new stuff but on the other hand I would like to live as well, and no answer so far, 2 days no answer, strange...

    I've had delays on deliveries from usually next-day vendors. I wouldn't panic it's a pretty usual thing for RM every december the delivery times are gonna suck. Order wayyy in advance. If you want it tomorrow you should order it last week.

    Post has slowed down further for me, I made 2 orders on Monday with vendors who usually deliver next day but neither order has turned up yet.  I just hope the sellers aren't selectively scamming this time of year and that Royal Mail hasn't lost the packages in the chaos for good.  Last year I lost a few legit orders off eBay and amazon round this time so I hope it's not the case here.  Will update on arrival, but looks like I'll be buying most of my Christmas stash on the street this year.

    Around x-mas the big sorting offices recruit a lot of temp workers who will steal interesting-looking post so yeah there is a possibility your post will be stolen but it's a very tiny % out of the thousands of 'interesting' post they will sort that you're the unlucky one who will get stole from and if it's a generic-looking thing that doesn't have ebay or amazon plastered all over it (as no 'SR envelope' will) it will look even less attractive to a thief.

      Around x-mas the big sorting offices recruit a lot of temp workers who will steal interesting-looking post so yeah there is a possibility your post will be stolen but it's a very tiny % out of the thousands of 'interesting' post they will sort that you're the unlucky one who will get stole from and if it's a generic-looking thing that doesn't have ebay or amazon plastered all over it (as no 'SR envelope' will) it will look even less attractive to a thief.

    if anyone will be stealing your package itll be your postman.im telling you the amount of cameras inside royal mail buildings is scary its worse than prison if something doesnt arrive its more than likely been lost by some temp who doesnt know what hes doing.im waiting on a package thats taking longer than usual myself. 8)

    Easy for the postman to steal a letter while walking his round. Most of them are more interested in getting all their mail posted so they can finish their shift though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are alot of temps directing the mail that the automatic character recognition machines have trouble with (bad printing / font).
    <br/>
    20% at a guess will get sent to the wrong regional distribution centres.
    <br/>
    Some will get sent to ireland by mistake to be opened as they have no address on them. (but in your case will not be opened as the address is there, someone just pressed the wrong button).
    <br/>
    Some will be stuck in the bottom of a bag/trolley that has been hurriedly emptied  until that bag is filled up and emptied again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What if some worker recognizes a return address as a fake (as they use that SR vendor themselves) and pockets the contents?

    My regular postman is definitely trustworthy and doesn't seem at all like someone who would steal mail, I talk to him all the time and he comes across as a very nice guy.  I've noticed though that this month for the most part there's been other people (presumably temps) doing his usual rounds and I've had a different postie every day, mostly young people.  Because of that for the moment I've stopped all international ordering til things resume to normality next year but I just hope that the last few domestic orders arrive soon and don't end up lost/stolen in the system among all the Christmas junk.  Indeed as brusselsprout said, you know there's something wrong when even a SweetLeafLondon package doesn't come next day (or in my case after 2 working days).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone still been lucky enough to receive domestic orders consistently next day or even within 2 days this week?

    I have an order that was dispatched on Monday. It is now Wednesday and I am beginning to worry.
    <br/>
    Hopefully it will come Thursday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Often, even at normal times of the year, 1st class takes two days if it has to travel the length of the country.
    <br/>
    1st class is no longer guaranteed next day delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have also looked at a regular legal mail order website and I see that they state that they are having trouble with parcels going missing at present?.

    Sure do. I mean it's not the most sophisticated crime and it's likely to get you caught (a quick google search you can find a few people caught for it) because of the CCTV but it happens and I'd guess it happens more regularly than reported. I've read news stories of sorting office workers opening greetings cards clearly addressed to/designed for children and pocketing the cash inside (scum of the earth, right?). As for putting the packages down their pants, they don't do that they just try and slice open the package sneakily and steal if there is something good inside.

    One of my orders from Monday made it through today from SweetLeafLondon, so hopefully the others will follow suit soon.  At this rate I'd expect another one tomorrow, so for me 3 - 4 days seems to now be the best case scenario with receiving deliveries at this time.

    I placed a domestic order (my first with this seller) with a highly regarded seller on Friday last week, its now Thursday and nothing yet  :(
    <br/>
    More worryingly i placed a larger order with Aakoven on Monday of last week, and that still hasn't arrived!!!!
    <br/>
    This is the first time ever ordering from AA that I didn't pay for priority (0.2 coins short  &gt;:( ) so i don't know if this long wait is normal?
    <br/>
    Anyone else have experience with Aakoven shipping time (standard mail)? Or even better, is anyone in the UK awaiting a parcel from AA at the moment who can put my mind to rest a little?

    All of mine from Monday have arrived now, all were domestic orders.  The quickest took 3 days but one just arrived today so that one took 5 working days or thereabouts to get here 1st class.  I'm thinking of doing maybe 1 more order next week but not sure if I should, since if it doesn't arrive on time who knows what's going to happen to it while RM goes on vacation altogether for Christmas.  Anyone else here thinking of placing a few more domestic orders next week or is it too risky and better just to wait til after the Christmas/New Year break?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @qwERtYOraNgeSa   6 days from NL is nothing to worry about.  Even outside of Christmas whenever I order from NL I always expect it to take a week, usually my orders from NL and Germany take 6 - 7 working days to arrive.  Around this time of year I'd expect it to arrive in about 2 weeks or just under, so you should hopefully receive it next week if it doesn't get intercepted or stolen.  If it's from a good vendor it should get there, unless some temp worker steals it because it's from NL.

    Waiting on a bunch of orders from the weekend, but haven't received jack shit as of yet.  I've noticed that the temp posties I've had lately aren't even turning up anymore to bring junk mail (which I usually get every day) so I think there's a pretty strong possibility at least some of my stuff's been stolen. I really hope something comes tomorrow, so far I definitely regret making this last batch of orders and would advise others not to order right now either unless you're happy to wait weeks for a domestic order to arrive.

    Keep the faith! I had one package sent 1st class which took 10 days from Aberdeen to London - arrived last saturday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But the one that shocked me was an order from budmail.biz I placed before I discovered SR - had given up on it, but then 27 business days after it was sent I got up early to take the bins out and there was a single letter from Canada sat on my doorstop - this was at 7am and the postman does not normally arrive till 12ish and they post my stuff through the letter box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All intact with no signs of tampering, but still a bit freaky none the less.

    What makes me worry about my recent orders is the fact that this week I haven't seen the temp posties deliver mail once on my street, it's as if they're just skipping work.  I've had no mail at all this week which is definitely an anomaly especially since I should have received about 5 or 6 items that I know of, it's exactly what happened last year when I "lost" a bunch of Amazon and ebay packages round this time.  I have to assume that while they're out doing nothing they might also be opening up and binning stuff they're supposed to be delivering to addresses.  Never ordering in mid December again, too much risk.  I'll stock up next year in November and just keep some shit hidden away in a jar for Christmas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I should mention I received an order just now which I had shipped to a friend's house who lives nearby, so hopefully the temps round my area are just being lazy and the orders I had shipped to my place will come soon.  The one I received to the other address today took 3 days also.

    I got an order today that took 8 days to come from Holland. Crazy. Also still waiting for a UK delivery that was supposed to have been posted first class on Monday. Like Rowsdower said, I think I'll stock up in November next year and avoid all this postal stress and hassle.

     4 days for 1st class post seems to be what it is taking for my items at present.

     4 days of paranoid hell. Wondering if the postman is really LE in disguise and is going to do me with his truncheon!

     But it got here in the end:)
