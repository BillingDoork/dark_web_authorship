    I'm new to SR, and I read in the buyer's guide that I should use an address unrelated to where I plan on keeping my item. The guide gave examples of addresses to use, such as a friend's house or a P.O. box. I don't have any friends addresses that I could use, so I wanted to ask whether or not it would be safe to use a P.O. box. I'm kind of worried that if the contents of my package get discovered, the police will monitor my P.O. box and then wait for me to open it and take the package out. Also, if it is safe to use a P.O. box (and I'm just being paranoid) should I use a fake name on the package's address, or will they not deliver it because it the name differs from my real name, which I assume I will have to use when getting a P.O. box?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have any other delivery address options or suggestions, feel free to let me know as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Id recommend the PO Box they do not have all the time in the world to sit there and wait for you. and they cant call the police the second you pull in the parking lot. especially after hours. most po boxes and can accessed 24/7.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and if you made a large order with tracking, then maybe let it sit for 24 hours before picking it up if your really worried.

    Hey guys
    <br/>
    It all really depends what you are ordering and what risks you want to take.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First of all if you are ordering the package to a PO Box registered in your name or to your own home address it really doesn't matter, both addresses are linked to you, the beauty about the whole system is that it is very hard for LE (Law Enforcement) to prove that you personally ordered that package, and will be considered a waste of time and money to gain a search warrant for a small amount of drugs, even if they did gain that search warrant, anyone dealing in larger amounts will have no evidence on there PC (it will be stored on an encrypted USB drive with a password that is almost impossible to crack) and no drugs on the property, the only evidence they have is a letter that has been sent to an address which you can easily deny that you knew anything about it. There would be no evidence for LE to make an arrest and the cops know this. Your average buyer that is purchasing personal amounts is generally safe, if LE does show up at the door, just deny deny deny!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I order my packages to my own address, i only order personal amounts of goods, if i was to order bigger amounts of good i would find a different method of delivery and that is because if anything was to happen and i did get a knock at the door i wouldn't want to involve the other people that i live with, even though i know LE wouldn't be able to do anything more than question me.

    ODB, really a great explanation of the whole situation, thanks for your answer. LE would have to do an impossible proving-job, and at the end it´ll be nothing to prove ;) ! I also think that any written notices or saved data about the delivery-address at or from your vendor could be the highest risk here, so take a look for a reliable vendor that destroys any infos about what ever, and doesn´t gives a fu** about storing something. Am I right here, or is it usual anyway not to store adresses? But really 100% sure you can never be that he takes care about it,  I think.

    Glad to have been of service.
    <br/>
    Just reread what i wrote and im glad you guys/gals got the idea haha, was slightly wasted when i wrote that. (I did some slight editing, hopefully that helps others heh)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And yeah oNLiN3 all vendors are told when creating a vendor account to delete all shipping information as soon as possible and never save any of that data, all vendors know about this and im sure the majority are deleting our info asap. A second level of protection for us is PGP, it basically turns our address into an encrypted code that only the vendor that your purchasing off has the password to, so if LE did happen to get into a vendors account all they would see is a giant encrypted code and not any real information ;D the vendors will be sure to never write this password down so noone can ever crack these messages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have fun people.

    One more important piece of information!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If its your first orders i would order small amounts from a domestic seller, not having to go through customs is a very safe way of doing this. If you do decide to order from overseas do some research on the forums and find out if that particular country (or vendor) has been successful in delivering to your country =.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know here in Australia that anything from the Netherlands and other spots will get looked at alot more when going through customs than mail thats coming from USA etc, certain countries are known to be drug hotspots and can have a much harder time getting into certain areas.

    I have everything sent to my addy and under my name, have yet to encounter a problem and as others said deny deny deny, if you feel there is something wrong wait a day to open the package, if they bust down your door and claim its your package you can tell them you were planning on returning to sender cause its not yours, or even better yet don't say a damn thing, call a lawyer. It is alot harder for them to prove it is yours then for you to prove its not. On top of that i doubt they would put that much time, effort and money into a personal user so as long as your not ordering pounds and kilos i wouldn't worry that much
