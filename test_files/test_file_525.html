    I received my package in the mail today but I'm afraid that I fucked up along the way and I read on a thread for newbies to not open a package for 1 day. The vender only sent 7 grams of weed, should I wait a day or should be fine opening it now?

    Some people advise against it, my thinking is once you grab it and its in your house thats enough for them to come knocking on the door.

    you think that LE would let you keep the package for more than 10 seconds before busting you if they wanted to?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they will wait 1 day to give you the chance to:
    <br/>
    - give it to someone else
    <br/>
    - smoke all of it
    <br/>
    - dispose of it
    <br/>
    - hide it outside of your house
    <br/>
    and at this time put a surveillance on you for a whole day for your 7 grams of weed just so they can wait that long to lose of their evidence, highly unlikely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Controlled delivery is something else on the other hand - and in that case also you would be busted instantly.

    If anyone had found out about the delivery they likely would have just confiscated the package, or worst case scenario, busted you before that package got anywhere near you. I don't see LE going through the trouble of setting you up over a few grams of weed. Just open it and make sure you got what you paid for so you can release escrow to your supplier.

    I recommend opening your pack BEFORE you try to smoke it. LE will for sure know whats up if they stroll up and you are poofing away on an envelope, but if you think that looks less suspicious, then by all means...

    I just open them, peek inside and toss them in the trash for a day or more.  Since you were not expecting the package and there is no indication your ordered it, you can't really determine what is inside from just peeking and this makes it VERY difficult to prove you knew what the contents were.  When deliveries are expected, I remove EVERYTHING illegal from the premises.  Raid me.  You would be lucky to find a pack of papers (which are legal anyway).

    People LE typically will not let you have suspected drugs on a controlled delivery for more than minutes not hours. LE number ONE goal if they know what is in the package is NOT letting those drugs get back on the street PERIOD. So here is what you do, after receiving package and writing return to sender and sitting by door, grab a bag trash bag with something, anything, but those drugs in it and IMMEDIATELY go to your car. Try to dive off and you will know in seconds whats up. If you are some kind of PABLO and have tons of packages coming to door they might wait longer after a delivery but they would never let the substance leave IMO.

    Haha I remember getting my first weed. Scary and exhilerating. Check your package well. If they did a good job use em again. If not even if the stuff is good seek a pro at stealth instead.
