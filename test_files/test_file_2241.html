    What should I make of this because this is my first time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It has been almost 2 weeks and the vender Thefrenchconnection has been offline for 8 days now (seriously never buy from this guy).  He PMed me saying he lost my address and that I needed to resend it so I did (encrypted of course) and this was on friday 8/31.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I only ordered a total of 1.2 mg of 3 different things not a large order, but I'm scared that my package was intercepted. If it is should I just lay low for a while? I was really hoping to try 2c-i and was gonna place an order with a different more reliable vender.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also what are some better ways of receiving packages I know Pine is loaded with ideas but I can't seem to find any of his/her's when I filter pine's posts.

    To me it sounds more likely that this vendor fucked you and didn't actually send anything, but it's always good to play it safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would continue ordering as normal but clean my house of anything incriminating first, so if on the off chance the Hitler youth-I mean police came knocking they wouldn't have anything to find. They can't really prove you ordered it and if you have nothing in your house there isn't much of a case as far as I can see.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mind you this is just what I would do, not necessarily what you SHOULD do.

    I'm just curious BlackEnd (since I'm not experienced), is that even a realistic scenario? If it gets seized, how and why would the cops come to the delivery address? Wouldn't they do a controlled delivery, if anything?

    If the vendor is absentminded enough to lose your address before getting the package labelled, he's absentminded enough to take a while before shipping things out, in which case your order could reasonably still be in transit.
    <br/>
    Also, depending on country of origin/destination, it could still be in transit regardless of when he shipped it. I'd wait a while before taking action beyond asking the vendor when he shipped/what the problem is.
    <br/>
    If he did ship, and once enough time has passed that the package definitely should have arrived, then yeah, it's possible that it got intercepted by someone or other. From your wording, it sounds like you gave your real address to ship to. I wouldn't be concerned with laying low so much as never having something shipped to me or in my name again. Believable pseudonym and empty houses is how it goes.
    <br/>
    But that's just me. I fully understand the paranoia, but no point dwelling on what may yet be nothing.

    If you didn't receive a letter from customs(assuming it was international), I would say you probably safe to order again.
    <br/>
    Form what I have seen no letter = Either never sent out, or lost/stolen in the mail.
    <br/>
    Or I suppose it's even possible with such a small amount that, if they did catch it, they could have pretty much disregarded it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would also advice against using the pseudonym/empty house method, could cause you more trouble than it's worth with a higher chance of getting busted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But that's just my opinion. Go with what you feel and listen to you instinct, if you feel you should lay low for awhile, lay low.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Goodluck  :D

    Thanks for all the replies, I appreciate it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some more information: Used a fake name (potential problem) and real address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This vender hasn't been online in 8 days otherwise I would NEVER call him out in a forum like this. He is clearly gone and doesn't want my BTC so I find it unlikely he scammed me. I think its more likely it got seized or he just never sent it out at all. I want to make another purchase (I guses using my real name this time) but I'm not sure how long I should wait.
