    Okay, so I just made my Sr account about a week ago. I live at a university  sanctioned residence- not exactly a dorm. I have received two packages and both were brought to the center building, I simply get an email from my building , go down , show my id and pick it up.Im not planning on purchasing cannabis -does not seem smart considering the possible odor. I have however contemplated buying dmt, mdma, shrooms, or lsd. all 4 of these seem like they would be discreet if bought in relatively small amounts from a reputable vendor.  I'm new so I dont know what other options I have. If a p.o box would be a better option would someone give me a little better idea of how to get one and effectively use it. Please dont give me the lecture on how i am stupid for  jeapordizing my education. I am an adult like everyone else on here who jeapordizes their life by dealing with illegal drugs. Any help is much appreciated!

    While we are a newer vendor, we have already shipped to college campuses several times with no problems. Just be sure all your information is correct and you'll likely be dandy with your mandy ;)

    Also... search function. This has been asked 100 times. :P

    Packages should be okay but I would tweak about getting letters from different countries/states all the time unless they were business mail.

    You should be fine.  If there is alot of foreign students there...I'm sure there are alot of packs from outside the USA.  Just exercise the usual precautions.
