    Looking to order about 50grams of substances into my drop box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are there any chances of the LE staking out the drop box and wait for me to pick it up?
    <br/>
    Or is it too small a quantity?

    Before you consider this make sure you have a good read of Customs media release's over the last few years, it will offer you valuable insight into how people get caught!

    OP no offense but your question is stupid. Of course there is A CHANCE of this happening, it just depends on if you are willing to risk doing it and whether you know how to minimize the risk by doing it right.

    Asking if there is a chance you can be caught is like asking if it will hurt if you put your nuts in a vice and turn the handle.

    Agreed!
    <br/>
    Just wondering why customs only release media about significant seizures tho eg 1 kg plus? Why don't they report trafficable seizures, do they not prosecute for trafficable amounts?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why not getting it shipped in more packages with lower quantities? Or even to different addresses.
    <br/>
    Have u really got a need for 50g's all at once? But I guess if it's 5g or 99g it's still below a commercial amount.

    Because there's little PR value in busting someone for ordering 3g of Molly via the intarweb.  You see on the news during the mid 2000's those dudes that attempted to import TONS of Eccy pills in tomato cans?  THAT'S got PR value.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was under the impression that very small amounts count as a trafficable amount, as in &gt;3g for a lot of substances.

    Is funding a possibility ? Like how in the world could state or federal gov even have enough resources to try and bust all the under 100g orders? Like think of the just the man power it would take..

    Do some drugs over other make you more nervous to order?  Not really bothered by ordering MDMA or prescription stuff . but H and Coke on the other hand im alot more apprehensive about, is this warranted? Even in small amounts?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Say you got done first offense with 50g of MDMA, I would imagine LE would be alot more lenient than if it was 50g of H right?

    That's some pretty serious misinformation right there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Commercial quantities" although varied from state to state, generally start at around 3g, at which point it is up to you to prove that you had no intentions of making a commercial gain. 50g+ is sure as hell considered a commercial quantity wherever you are and you'd be up the creek if caught with such an amount.

    Been a long time since I had any contact with the law,  but 5 or 6 years ago everyone who got caught with a ounce or more of meth was getting 5 to 8 years in prison.

    I would still think if you get done with a ounce or more of hard drugs like H, Meth, Cocaine, maybe (MDMA if the courts are seeing a lot of it). You be doing some time.

    I would keep any single package under 10 grams in postal system because a) penalties if caught b) better chance of getting threw or be a full boss and go for multi kilo imports via other means.

    Why would 10g be any different from 50g? It's still in the trafficable amount range.
    <br/>
    It would still be looked at as a trafficable amount in the eye's of le,judges,jury's.
    <br/>
    50g is not a commercial amount, and it's not upto to u to prove anything unless u rep Yrself in court.
    <br/>
    If it were a first offense a good lawyer could very well save u from visiting BUBBA
    <br/>
    And also don't forget that it goes from the amount of PURE DRUG so that 50g could possibly be 35-40g but either way it's still in the TRAFFICABLE amount range.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I nearly went for a commercial quantity of pills(hundreds) a few years back(not importing just trafficking) but they dropped it to trafficable after the analysis came back and also another trafficable amount of another drug.
    <br/>
    2x trafficable amounts plus other charges, well whatever they could get on me.
    <br/>
    One of the worst times in my life,spent time in jail when they initially caught me, raided my parents house, I had a very early curfew for 6 odd months, going to court once every month for well over a year, meetings with my lawyer, even sent me to see a shrink, It really took a blow to my state of mind going through all of that.
    <br/>
    I rehabilitated myself and got off the drugs and stopped going to clubs slinging my shit, proved to the court that it was one big mistake and I was(had) bettered myself.
    <br/>
    On the day of sentencing I thought I was going away, said goodby to my parents and my gf, I was shitting it but on the other hand after going to court for so long ect I was prepared for the worst and pretty much accepted that I did the crime so I just had to accept the punishment handed down, I pleed guilty at the earliest time possible so I got a reduction in my sentence.
    <br/>
    I WAS SPARED JAIL
    <br/>
    I'm not going to go into what I recieved for my own safety but from that one night from getting caught it Held on to me for 5 fucking years.
    <br/>
    Theres lots more but I'm not prepared to go to deep.
    <br/>
    This is my true story I don't know why I wanted to share this with everyone but there u go.
    <br/>
    It's not pretty!

    AND!!

    <br/>
    A mate of mine got caught with a quarter of the amount I did but much more cash, he did nothing to better him self and got caught a number of times after that with small quantities while he was on bail for his initial charge.
    <br/>
    Well the court didn't like that one bit, he got sentenced to a year on the bottom.
    <br/>
    He had no choice tho, he owed a fair amount of cash and had no way of paying it back except "sell drugs".
    <br/>
    Just a young cunt too, 20 I think he was when he went, with no other priors except that.

    +1 for you when I can, I've had some weird ass pm's man on here, where did you get day 6 from? lol  (EDIT now I'm going have that dude from that other thread calling me a sycophant of yours)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Safest bet would be to move to Tassy, trafficking doesnt start until 25+ grams down there, everywhere else is 2g+ of pure product once tested so I think 5-10grams would be safer and easier to get more leniency than 50grams
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But it also depends on your record, circumstances, judge blahblah, but if they raid your ass for 5-10 grams and find cutting agents and 1000's of empty pill caps on top of scales and baggies and you have a long record then you may want to stock up on some Wet Stuff

    Ok, speaking as someone who got done back in the '90's for trafficking the cops will get you if they want to- we got raided and they found less than a gram of gear in the place but we had some shitty old powder scales and some foil squares so we were charged with trafficking.
    <br/>
    Those cops bashed the shit out of my ex, smacked me around, had their guns out and trashed my house all for less than 1 gram of smack- they still got the case successfully prosecuted because my ex was known and they wanted to make a point. Now that SR is around, on the news and so on I will bet that the cops (state or federal) are wanting to make an example of someone, so please don't fool yourself into believing having less than a certain amount will spare you- they will fuck you over if it suits their needs.
    <br/>
    OTOH I have had a cop let me finish having a whack in my car back when I used heavily (10+ years ago) with a talk about waiting for 20 minutes or so to straighten up a bit before I drove.
    <br/>
    However, I honestly believe that the publicity surrounding SR means TPTB are going to want to put the scare into users/dealers and continue the illusion that the ~war on drugs~ is being fought vigorously , so eventually someone is going to get done- with a great deal of publicity- and held up as an example and it's really pot luck as to who will end up being the sacrificial lamb. Sure minimise your risks, go with reputable suppliers, be smart etc etc etc. Just don't fool yourself into thinking they won't hang you out to dry if it suits their needs/agenda.
