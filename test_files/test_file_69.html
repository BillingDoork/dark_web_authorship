    Hey, so I'm kind of new on silk road, I haven't yet purchased anything but I'm definitely wanting to get in on the trade. However, my problem is that I do not have a house that I can ship drugs to, I'm 19 and live at home and have very intrusive parents. They would like go through my mail and what not.. So, what I'm getting at is, do vendors on silk road ship to PO boxes? If not, does anybody have any suggestions for places I could get my product shipped to other than my house or a friend's? Shipping to a friend's house isn't an option. Thanks!

    P.O. box. is your best option. They also ask for TWO forms of ID with your current mailing address on the ID. The PO Box I got is not in my own town, but a few miles away. It also is 24/7 hours and has no cameras. I feel pretty comfortable taking a ride to the PO Box at night knowing there is no one there to bother me.

    PO box is your best bet. If you are shipping large amounts only rent in three month periods instead of annually as you want to be able to switch if your address gets flagged.

    Is there a way to get a PO box or something like it without providing identity. So say I do provide identity to the post office. . If they find something suspicious what will stop them from coming to my home address and getting me? Future thanks for replies.

    Having a PO box registered you is only usefull for keeping stuff out of your house that you do not want your parents to find. The people that work at the PO box wont ever visit your house. For larger amounts customs/LE will but other than that you will just get love letters to your PO box.
    <br/>
    Open it with a high quality fake ID and you are a lot safer.

    really if you were making orders to the same PO box, and it got flagged.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they would easily just look up the details of the PO box and come get ya.

    I've been using a PO box for a little while now and it works nicely. I trust the vendors to be secretive about their packaging so I'm not too worried about my box getting flagged.
    <br/>
    It's a trade off- do you want to run the risk of LEO catching your shipments or do you want to have to explain to your roomies why you keep getting mail from Germany and companies in Texas no one's ever heard of?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Setting up a box with a fake, now THAT would be killer

    Some stores will accept and hold your package for a small fee, even without a PO Box. I have been using one store off and on for years. I try to switch it up from time to time and keep the shipments low. I just say its from ebay and that I do not trust my building roommmates. Mind you, I do not order anything illegal.
