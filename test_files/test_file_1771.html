    Hey guys, im a little curious wondering how many packages you guys have had coming at once to one address,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And also how many of you use multiple drops or fake names anything like that. ATM i have made about 30 orders to a few diff drops, and the most i've had coming at once was around 5 letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    100% arrival  rate

    I guess it depends if u live near a city or rural area. I have had all my packages delivered to my address successfully for about a year now. b 4 the road I'd buy shit off eBay and amazon frequently so the postman doesn't bat an eye when I get a parcel. casual like. I'd be suspicious if I was a mail carrier that had to delivery these random packages to these seemingly random drop off places. but if it ain't broke don't fix it.

    I am with you.  Regularly get all sorts of packages.  Use home and PO and spit them up about 75PO/25Home.  You should be good.  Just don't sign or anything you shouldn't have to and avoid international to be on the safe side.

    Order lots of legal shit to your place off of ebay from the same area that you get your drugs from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they do check a package they may get one of the ebay ones and give up.

    Getting 5 packages a day without a return address is for sure not a good thing. Other than that I don't see a problem when the packages make sense and look normal. Maybe if you never get anything, and then it starts to flood, but even that should be ok, you just started to use the possibilities of online-shopping. ;)

    I order legit stuff online that I try to have shipped from states that I receive most of my packages from. Like the known drug sources states.

    I ordered about 50+ parcels to an address that was a total trap (in a 6month period.) After number 50something I ordered 1-Oz of Wax from Just4u2NV, and behold a love letter arrived instead of my wax. Thanks to J4U for reshipping, but it was quite surprising and my first experience. Usually their parcels arrived in 3-4biz days, this time it took about 5-6 before my postal inspection service letter arrived. Not too big of a deal, but enough to obviously stop all traffic and scrap the location within a week :P I'd say moral of the story, it depends a lot. Take in to account your location, the demographics of the area, vendor location, number of international vs domestic orders to your address, and I may be missing a couple others. All of these in conjunction can give you a pretty good idea when it's time to stop, or even time to get the hell out of dodge. Hope this experience helps!
