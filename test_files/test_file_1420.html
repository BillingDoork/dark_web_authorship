    I was wondering if the click n ship mehod is safe to use as a vendor if I use a fake name/ return address as well as use a prepaid debit card for payment? If this method isn't acceptable what is the easiest way to get tracking anonymously?

    It seems a little risky but I have heard of at least one vendor saying s/he did that by using public wifi with a prepaid credit card activated with fake info. Otherwise people use the form 400 labels for tracking though I guess those are getting harder to get.

    I believe you just add .90 in postage and slap it on the package.

    I also need this tracking thing answered.

    I get what people mean by, buy 400 labels, and then "slap .90 postage on there".

    This is holding me back from offering fake ID's at a fair price! ($100).

    USPS has another piece of software called Shipping Assistant that prints labels with tracking but without postage. So you would not have to associate a bank account or credit card, just print the label and then affix the proper amount of postage with stamps. As a bonus, tracking is free for First Class and Priority when using this method. Mail with stamps can be dropped in a blue box if it weighs less that thirteen ounces- over thirteen with stamps must be handed to an employee in the post office.

    Both programs require connecting to the usps.com server and cannot be done without creating an electronic paper trail.

    The problem with electronic postage is that any system you use stores the customer's information (address, name, etc) forever. So if your mailing 20 packages a day under that account- everyone is tied together. If you get one upset buyer or someone trying to bring you down- you put all of your buyers in jeopardy

    If you use Priority envelopes, the 400 labels are free to use for track. Just slap a $5.60 stamp , and a 400 tracking label on your envelope and your good to go! I don't know if that same rule applies to other methods ofÂ  mailing with USPS though. I've always just shipped Priority myself, so it's all I know.
