    weird.. here it is:
    <br/>
    -----------
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A FORMER Hobart nightclub owner had a cocaine package addressed to his dog and delivered to his house from Victoria, a court heard yesterday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Builder Samuel John Morse, 26, of Kingston, pleaded guilty to drug trafficking yesterday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He was nabbed in May after the Kingston Mail Centre informed police a suspicious package had arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Drug squad detectives investigated and discovered an ounce 28 grams of cocaine in the Express Post package addressed to "Benji" Morse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They replaced the drug with sugar, prosecutor Patrick Dixon told the Supreme Court in Hobart, and waited.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Postal workers tried to deliver the package to Morse's address and left a calling card when they discovered he was not home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He picked it up the next day and opened it during the drive home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After finding it contained sugar instead of cocaine he threw it out the window, Mr Dixon said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Drug detectives arrived at his house a short time later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They learned Benji was Morse's dog and the package was the second such delivery he had ordered in recent weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first ounce costing $7500 arrived undetected weeks earlier, Morse confessed, after he and three friends put up the money and he arranged for a Victorian-based dealer to supply the drug, which is not widely available in Tasmania.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Defence lawyer Jim Saric said because Morse was the one with the drug dealer contact, he agreed to place the order and planned to store his quarter-ounce share away for future use.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police could not have charged him over the first ounce had it not been for his confession, the court heard.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mr Dixon said that Morse refused to name his dealer or provide the bank details he had used to deposit the money until they told him what he was being charged with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Morse had recently sold his share in CBD nightclub Halo for $80,000, Mr Dixon said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mr Saric told Justice David Porter that Morse was very remorseful and had undergone drug counselling during which his counsellor determined he was unlikely to take drugs again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Justice Porter was told Morse, who was ashamed of what he had done, had led an exceptionally industrious life and was in every other respect an excellent contributor to society.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The judge ordered he be assessed for a community service order suitability before bailing him to reappear for sentence next Thursday.

    Actual Translation: Basically cocaine goes for up to 300 USD a gram. It was probably complete junk purity too. I bet all Oz cocaine is stomped on dozens of times before it reaches their shores. I'm willing to also bet $100 USD of unadulterated cocaine translates to $400 - $600 AU dollars or so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australia, New Zealand, they are the new Spice Islands and we are the new Dutch East India Company.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Time to schedule a flight to Taz!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But seriously, it's annoying some people suddenly envisage somebody buying drugs as a dangerous psychopath, you know immediately you're dealing with infantile minds who know all about the real world from cop shows/TV serial dramas and hip hop music or some other equally depressing bullshit. Even that recent researcher on SR wrote that he was amazed it is business as usual on here /subtext/ that we're not madly stabbing each other in the head every five seconds. /subtext/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is also annoying that anybody thinks sugar looks like a substitute for cocaine. Was this really really really finely ground down granulated sugar that was then processed in such a way to create a cocaine like texture. Inquiring minds want to know. Because if somebody thought regular granulated sugar looks like cocaine, then I concur with the article mentioning that cocaine isn't frequently found in Tasmania.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At this rate, drug buyers will be standing there poleaxed, wondering why somebody has sent them a packet of sugar cubes with overnight delivery when the Tasmanian LE agents raid the house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Protip for vendors and Oz buyers: Taz has a higher threshold for possession/trafficking than mainland Australia. If I remember rightly you can be shipped 25 grams of cocaine and it is still a possession charge. 25 grams of weed, 25 grams of heroin, doesn't matter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this boy was smart, he would have ordered 20 grams at a time, over time, making new orders upon receipt and product validation of the previous package. Especially since he was ordering from a geographically local location, the order delivery time was not a real factor. Given the quantities involved, it would also have been economic to be using 3rd party addresses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, cocaine, like weed, has an odor with very high permeation rates even though humans can't smell this as well as dogs can. If that vendor had packaged properly in triplicate using the techniques often described in several threads on this forum, it is unlikely the packages would have even been intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally, for the nth time, when you receive a package, you leave it alone in the letterbox/mail slot for a day or so and don't open it. Say nothing to the police and they have literally nothing to go on. I could mail you all kinds of things, but it doesn't imply you ordered them.

    <br/>
    the caliber of people that the police are catching don't exactly sound like criminal masterminds, lowest hanging fruit I guess,
    <br/>
    do the local post offices look out for dodgy mail a lot? or was this just a bad case of packaging from a dealer who has no experience in it?\

     If you sell bread croutons to an undercover cop and claim it's 10 grams of crack, you will get charged with selling 10 grams of crack. So you might as well sell 10 grams of actual crack, except you don't have 10 grams of crack. You're just a piece of shit, trying to scam people with bread croutons.

    Likely the seller wasn't experienced and didnt use any concealment techniques of any kind. Regardless, considering the guy had plausible deniability regarding the contents of the package he should have, as the person stated before, not opened it for as long as possible. Secondly, should have not spilled his guts all over LE's shirt and said I received an unknown package for my dog, like any curious non-paranoid person I opened it and it was sugar so I threw it away. That is if he HAD to open it.
    <br/>
    This stresses the importance of packaging and the practice of personal amount buys on cross-border shipments.

    Yes I know. It's bullshit of the highest order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It also completely misses something else, which is that if your aim in life is to prevent people obtaining crack cocaine, then allowing dealers to sell croutons is fine because it frustrates customers, relieves them of their cash, and dampens demand because croutons are unknown for their miraculous highs.

    Ask for the Australian government for their rationalization of it. I have no idea and I think if I tried to work out their labyrinthine mindset about what is or isn't legal I'd be dribbling at the end of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For one thing, almost no drug users or dealers I know IRL (SR is another thing completely, we're leet) actually know the percentages and quantities distinguishing possession from intent to supply. Well, the MDMA merchants I know do, but then again people who sell various kinds of amphetamines tend to be fairly streetwise (and wired) because their margins are thinner than most. This is because the law is not remotely transparent in many places about these things. In many situations, even the lower level LE agents don't even know what constitutes a felony. This means when they go on a raid, they sometimes don't know whether they are putting a door hammer to some typical drug consumer or some dude who's been preparing for that day like fucking Rambo or something. This kind of unproductive obfuscation leads to all kinds of horrible calamities on both sides of the drug war.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure if this is deliberate, but there is such a huge gap between reality and the law, that if you walk across state lines with 1 gram, that's right, 1 gram, of heroin, you could be thrown in jail for a couple of days or you could go to prison for the rest of your natural life and there is really no way to distinguish between these outcomes in most cases. I wish I was joking, but I can find you references to back this up. This may not be the case in all countries, but it sure as hell is the case in the US of A. This turns the concept of punishment = an example is made = crime is prevented into some kind of sick sordid joke.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This results in a situation, where a lot of RL drug vendors actually take risks which are way over the top in comparison to the reward, which implies this strategy, whatever the rationale is, is definitely backfiring. We got oddles of Law, but Order seems to be a much rarer beast.
