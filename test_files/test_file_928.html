    so recently i have heard of people getting cd for 100g packs of mdma.  i don't recall ever hearing someone getting a 50g cd.  possible, but i have no account ie news story to support this.  i guess im trying to figure the sweet spot on where the gov would just simply throw away/destroy vs send you a love letter and or do a control delivery
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i would believe that 100g+ would constitute for a cd
    <br/>
    <br/>
    10-50-love letter?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1-10 just destroy?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *i guess once it past sorting facility everything is solid.

    I'm pretty confident that LE's guidlines aren't that specific. What they're looking for is resale intention and I would think 50g would definitely justify their curiosity. Logically, someone ordering 50g most likely has other drugs or quantities in their possession. Having said that, I too haven't heard of a CD for that amount but that doesn't mean you won't be the first. Again what matters is the vendor's reputation for stealth and professionalism.

    having a very very very hard time deciding on a vendor.  the 3 i am looking at all have lots of fans, lots of sales, steady 5/5 and success.  its very different/difficult to be on the receiving end rather than just consulting and grinding the numbers
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the max ive had come through is 30, but i feel 50 is another ball game in and of itself when considering stealth ect

    Have you read about cloudsurfer? his stealth is known to be legendary. He currently has 30 and 50g listings. I haven't heard a single negative thing about him and his product is also supposed to be one of the best.
