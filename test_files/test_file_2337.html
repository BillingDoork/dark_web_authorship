    Hey guys. My roommate in my apartment ordered about a quarter (7 grams) of bud on Monday night, shipped Tuesday morning for Domestic Priority shipping. Vendor had a near perfect rating with lots of transactions. He had to finalize early since he was a new buyer. It still hasn't shown up in about 3 days, including today. Should I just have patience and stop panicking over my friend getting a love letter? I use the silk road too and all of my packages have made it okay under my name. First time he bought something for himself so he used his name. I just don't want to lose the wonderful service of silk road :(. Is it unnatural to wait this long for priority shipping in Domestic? I live in a busy city in an apartment by the way.

    Priority mail from the West Coast to the East Coast, especially in a major city, takes a maximum of 3 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the vendor simply marked the item "in transit" on Tuesday, that doesn't necessarily mean they shipped it then.
    <br/>
    And most vendors for bud that I've dealt with, will only ship Priority if it's 1 oz +.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    7 grams is most likely going to arrive safely, in a First Class(3-5 business days) bubble-mailer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, if it WAS shipped priority, the vendor should be able to provide a DCN. If they refuse to provide a DCN, then call BS.
    <br/>
    DCN = Deliver CONFIRMATION Number. This is NOT a step-by-step tracker, nor will it reveal any information about the sender.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just origin scans, sorting, and expected arrival and delivery declaration.

    Ok, the vendor provided my roommate with the DCN number. I have to commend how quickly he responded and how much support he gave my roommate. 5/5 communication for that. From the DCN number, it said it arrived in our home city sorting facility late yesterday afternoon and that's the latest update. You think the chances are good?

    Yup. It will most likely be there tomorrow. I've lived in a couple major cities on the East Coast, we get the luxury of a package delivery truck separate from our regular mail. If it was priority, small flat rate will come with regular mail. Medium + will come with that extra special delivery truck which can come as late as 6 PM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most likely if it left the accepting facility, and made it past the first sorting site, you're golden.
