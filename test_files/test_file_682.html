    Hi guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Say if you were going for a short holiday to an unknown country, but it was really short, say 4 days.
    <br/>
    How confident would you be of getting stuff delivered to that unknown country, to the hotel, under your name ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would presumably have to be your real name, else the front desk wouldn't know who its for.
    <br/>
    And it wouldn't have your room number either, because you only get one upon checking in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously the difficulty with a foreign country is getting in touch with quality stuff (whatever that may be!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Reason why I'm asking cause I'm planning some short holiday to an asian country(not sure where yet), and most of them aren't very tolerant of drugs. i.e. Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, that kinda thing.
    <br/>
    Well actually, scratch Singapore, that place is whack.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this a good idea?

    It would be hard to estimate the delivery time due to the postal workers not being able to read English or being able to read English and delivering faster. Contacting the hotel in advance and saying you are waiting on visa info, and having the sender put a return address for a random embassy would help...

    If you're talkin about blotter, stick that in your wallet/middle of a book.  They won't catch anything.  I dunno how much I'd trust the postal service/customs of some wackaloon country with decades minimum sentencing for poppy seed bagels.

    The thought of  walking through customs with drugs on me gives me the heebie jeebies!
    <br/>
    But yea, thinking more MDMA than anything else really.

    Think this happened in UAE, and that incident where some marijuana got stuck on some reporter's shoe. http://dopemagazineonline.com/cannabis-shoe-brit-freed-from-dubai-jail/
    <br/>
    Maybe this is a terrible idea after all.

    Once met a guy who did exactly this. He complained that it was so hot that on the ride from the airport to the hotel all the caps melted and stuck together though.
