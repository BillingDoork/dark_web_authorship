    ...why?  What is the rationale?  (Talking about PO boxes at USPS locations in the US).  I have been curious about the reasoning for vendors restricting orders to PO boxes for a long while, but never cared enough to ask until now.  If this question is out of line, let me know and I'll edit it away...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been using a single PO box for my SR orders for close to 2 years.  I have had 35+ orders delivered to my box, plus tons of other mail from ebay amazon etc..  I have never had any issues whatsoever.  Every single order was delivered.  (A few international orders required a signature, but I just went to the desk at the post office and signed--no issues).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also work very close to my PO box (but live pretty far away), so in terms of finalizing in a timely manner, I never take more than 24 hours to finalize from the time the package is delivered to the box, and usually I am able to pick it up and finalize in &lt;6 hours (one time I checked the box as my letter was being put in the box...the postal worker handed me the letter through the box).   Most times, I get the package within 3 hours of delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In addition, I was informed a few days ago that USPS offers a service that will notify customers whenever any parcel is put in the box, and another service that allows customers to have parcels delivered to the street address of the post office for the purpose of allowing people to have items shipped to their box from vendors who will not ship to PO boxes (such as Amazon Prime 2-day/Overnight shipping).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regarding the security of the recipient, since the box is tied to a fake identity, there is a much better level of protection to the customer, in case the package is intercepted.  In that  case, LE doesn't know the customers real address, and so the best they can do is just confiscate the package.  The customer would be safe (not considering a sting op at the post office, and CCTV at the post office--both relatively unlikely compared to having a controlled delivery for a package with your real name and address on it).  Plus, a package that is being delivered to someones real address with their real name *still* has to go through a post office to get delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, what is the issue that some vendors have with shipping to customers with PO boxes?  Is there a security concern for the vendor that I don't understand?  Is it the fact that some customers (not me as I mentioned above) will only check their box once a week, thus delaying finalizing when the package is sitting in the box?  Is there something else that I'm just not seeing?  Or is it that vendors just want to have their customers' real addresses? (I fucking hope not)!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every vendor I have ordered from has had no problem delivering to my PO box.  I am posting this solely out of curiosity.  Most vendors will ship to PO boxes in my experience here.  But I still have seen vendors state in their profile that they won't ship to boxes, and I've seen vendors post along those lines in the forums as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just curious to know the rationale, or if it's just some vendors random shipping policy quirks.

    I'd really like some insight to this as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The service you're referring to with having the package delivered to the street address of the PO is called Poste Restante or General Deliver unless I'm mistaken.  You can have the package shipped there with your name but you have to show ID and sign to receive it.  Most vendors are opposed to shipping in this manner due to the high number of no-shows/scams/confiscations/idiot being to scared to go pick it up. haha. ;)

    As a vendor, I am actually curious about this as well. I don't have a problem with sending to PO boxes as I just assume the client either has a large PO box that can fit whatever in it or accepts the fact they might have to go to the counter to get the packages. As it would be with anything sent to a PO box.
    <br/>
    If anyone wants to chime in with some concrete reasoning as to why not to send to a PO box, I'd be interested to hear it.

    Controlled deliveries would be more worrisome I would think at home, by far, than at a PO Box.
    <br/>
    You are much less likely to have anything illegal on you when you get a package at a PO box than your home being 100% clean.
    <br/>
    If they wanted to bust you at the PO they could just drop a notice at your door and make you get it at the PO anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Care to elaborate more on that?

    @weirdal, I don't see why vendors would hesitate to send to a Poste Restante or General Deliver address as it would look like a regular street address, and I am inclined to think that most vendors don't check every address they ship to, to check if it as a PO or a residence, but I don't know either way.  However, thanks for pointing out the fact that they ask for ID every time.  That one fact turns me off from using that service, since my alias ID that I used for the box isn't "official", and having to show it each time is just adding an extra level of risk to something that already works for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @Empathy101, I would hope that anyone who wants to receive packages to a PO box would purchase a box large enough to hold a small box parcel.  My PO box is about the same dimensions as a standard residential box, maybe a little bit smaller (it's their typical size, not the smallest, but the most common size they offer).  The packages that I have had to pick up at the desk were probably too large to fit in my residential box, too, so I'd be surprised if a vendor would choose not to ship to PO boxes, just because they fear their package won't fit and will be held at the desk to be picked up there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and @loniax and @pPharm, controlled deliveries are precisely the reason I chose to opt for a PO box under an alias identity.  If the USPS detects my illegal parcel, and wants to set up a CD, they would be SoL, becuase the identity tied to the box is a forged identity.  Unless they want to park a LEO at the post office 24/7 until i decide on my time to show up and pick it up...which is absurd, of course.  I've picked up some packages at 1:00 AM.  And if a cop was at the PO when I rolled up at 1:00, I'd be gone immediately!!  Plus, it lets me give my alias identity to the vendor rather than my real name (an alias which is officially authorized to receive packages to my PO address).  If the vendor is confiscated and goes honeypot, or saved addresses which they shouldn't, they won't know who I am for real, they will just have my alias.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So yeah, I know it's uncommon for vendors to deny PO shipments.  Judging by the replies so far, I'm thinking it's even more of a non-issue than I previously assumed.  But I am still curious as to the reasoning, since it almost seems to me that PO boxes are a better choice for a SR transaction for both parties, but much much safer for the buyer (if they do it anonymously and safely).

    The way to do PO Boxes is get a big one like i did it can hold multiple packs delivered the same day if it had too and i've had up to four delivered at once and it was barely half full, two i can go get them at any time which is nice.  I'm up to 61 orders on SR and never once has a vendor voiced any hesitation or concern about me asking them to deliver to a PO Box.

    I'd keep in mind that if you open a PO box under a fake ID, this kind of shit is EXTREMELY intriguing to LE. You're not just another guy receiving some drugs in the mail. You look like a professional. Busting a professional-looking criminal is the kind of thing that makes LE's dick harder than a diamond in an icestorm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're receiving large amounts to your PO box with a fake ID, there's a very specific strategy to picking up the shipments. If you're not following a good gameplan CONSTANTLY, then you might as well open the PO box in your own name; that way, you won't get some fed charges added onto you when you do get busted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, just because you don't see a cop sitting there in the post office parking lot, it doesn't mean they aren't nearby. Hell, they could be sitting half a mile away with binoculars just waiting for someone to pull in to the PO box late at night. Maybe they won't even bust you the first time. They'll just analyze camera video and see what your routine is for picking up the mail. i.e. what kind of car, what time you usually check, and where you park. Who's to say they won't just put a tracker on your shit that'll activate upon motion? Yes, it is very expensive for them to keep a unit sitting on your PO box for large periods of times, but there are more efficient ways to bust an importer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't underestimate LE. Or you'll be sitting in a pen for 7 years wishing you didn't act so cocky and lazily.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm actually curious about finding some type of police detection equipment. I know there are really fancy radars for street racers and such, but I wonder if this would pick up on an undercover detective just conducting surveillance. Maybe I should make some appointments with some private detectives in cities nearby me. I'm sure I could find some ex-cop that'd be willing to sell some valuable intel. I'd be reaaaal careful to maintain my anonymity with them though.  I've often considered purchasing a second PO box next to mine so I can go in on one night to the the second PO box that has no drugs, then walking out to see if I get followed etc,. If everything goes fine on the first night, then the following day I'll go back in for my package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I see no reason why vendors dislike or refuse PO boxes though. It's just another piece of mail.... The way my boxes are setup wouldn't even give away that I'm using a PO box. Just looks like another address to everyone except the fella delivering the mail.

    What's with people worrying if their pack will fit in their po box? At every post office I've ever seen, if it doesn't fit, they put a key in your box, and you walk down the hall and open the corresponding locker and get your pack. I have numerous successful orders to a 3x5.5 inch PO box. When I see the key, I know it's here!

    We deliver to PO boxes and have never had an issue.

    <br/>
    My one personal question that arises is: "why would you want an illegal item in a government facility for a single second than absolutely necessary?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're fucked, you're fucked.  If they figure out there's drugs coming in, they'll track you down if it's a PO Box or not.  But why give them any extra time for something to happen that gives them a second look at your package?

    If the shipping stealth is up to par as it should be than there really shouldnt be an issue with shipping to a PO BOX, or anywhere for that matter. I would definitely suggest a PO BOX through an independent company though. In my area there are small mom n pop stores, packaging stores etc. that offer PO Boxes within their store. As far as CD, like another user said, if the police know whats in the box theyll track you down regardless.
