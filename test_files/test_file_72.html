    Hey guys. Iv recently carried out my second and third purchase on SR.. My second was 5 grams of weed from holland. Unfortunatly it never arrived but the seller agreed to reship. Neither package arrived. The same week i puchased 1gram of weed form th UK. Sayin as i live in Northern Ireland (UK) i thought my chances of recieving the package would be greater but unfortunatly it never arrived either. All in all that is 11grams of weed. Have i been selectivly scammed for being a n00b or should i be waiting on the cops coming knocking..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone also know what the postal services or customs do when items like these ar found. although my address was on the package the name was one of a previous tennant.

    UK&gt;UK being stopped is rare unless the seller is a complete idiot and didn't package your stuff up properly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've never had a package lost UK&gt;UK.

    ... I believe you have just sent 11g of weed to the previous tenant who put in a change of address (that's how it would work in America).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either he'll blaze it up and never send you a thank you, or turn it in to the police and they'll come knocking.  You really shouldn't have used the previous tenant's name, IMO.  Sorry man.  Even if the first package got through, it may have been a mistake -- 3 in a row?  Sounds like there was a definite reason, and forwarding address seems most likely to me.

    You know, I'm sorry, that's not true: they may just ignore it.  It's not worth the time or effort to try and prove you ordered the package (which they probably couldn't do if you shut up and didn't say anything during their "interview" of you).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure.  I spoke too soon -- sorry man, didn't mean to give you half-truths.

    One shipment disappearing is likely to be selective scamming/intercepted by poor packaging techniques. Two, I'd suggest that you use a new address. Three, and I'd suggest you format your computer and rid yourself of all incriminating evidence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is of course unlikely that they would bust you for such a small amount, but it's better to be safe than sorry. With 3 failed shipments I'd say the address is compromised.
