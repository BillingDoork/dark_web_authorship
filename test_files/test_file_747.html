    There's some concern over the new tracking labels that USPS could correlate the number range to the address it was sent to should a package get flagged. Well there's only one way to test that out:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Someone get a roll of labels, not a dealer or anyone who cant take a visit from the cops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Temporarily get all the drugs out of your house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. Give a label to someone who lives far away from you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Have them ship a unsealed bag of weed in clear violation of best practices (while still keeping it anonymous) to someone they know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5. The shipper alerts the recipient that a unsealed package is coming their way and to refuse/ignore it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    6. See what happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the buyer of the labels get a visit, then we know they do this, then he can just say he sold them to someone online who was looking for some and doesnt have any more information. If we can determine this than we wont have to jump through hoops for what might be a non-issue. Anyone want to take one for the team?
