    hi ,
    <br/>
    thank you for taking the time to read this post. I have been researching setting up shop on SR for nearly a week now. I have sent out 2 samples using my stealth packaging. I was wondering do you think i should wait and see if my method is successful before setting up shop on SR?  I have already made up a batch of packages all ready to go .All with printed labels and business return address .  I am intending to sell mainly oxycontin at the best prices on SR. I just want to make sure i do it all properly so that way i can offer a first class service at great  prices.Once again thank you for taking the time to read this.
    <br/>
    Kind regards
    <br/>
    RP
