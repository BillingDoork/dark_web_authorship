    i recently bought 100 25i trips and they came in a lettter just stuffed between 2 bits of paper!
    <br/>
    i would have thought they would definitely come in plastic of some sort! i mean u are suppose to handle them with tweezers correct?
    <br/>
    also there was powder in the letter i assume from the blotters themselves!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and they were shit compared to others that i have purchased! that being the reason for this whole post!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thoughts anyone????

    Yeah I'm failing to see the issue as well... awful packaging?  Put it in the vendor feedback and move on.  Awful product?  Put in the vendor feedback and move on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously you should have a chat with the vendor before hand to see if there's a reason for any of it.

    Well the packaging wasn't awful as nbome is legal as most everywhere!
    <br/>
    All it needs so to be discreet and I very much doubt that we product suffered because of this packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't leave anyone bad feedback over this and if you want it to be packaged differently suggest that to the vendor.

    nbome is not legal almost everywhere...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sounds like you bought weak nbome. In between 2 pieces of paper is totally fine. Probably even better than in plastic.
    <br/>
    You're lucky nbome is cheap. Still it is pretty dumb to buy 100x weak nbome...
    <br/>
    Be more certain about the quality before buying such a quantity...

    So im wrong but you don't tell me how so. Well thats very helpfully!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as I know NBOMe is illegal in Australia, Russia, Israel, a handful of states in America and was just very recently made illegal in the UK.
    <br/>
    Given the fact there are 196 countries in the world and it's illegal in 5 I don't think I misused the phase 'almost everywhere'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But hey, I'm no expert...
