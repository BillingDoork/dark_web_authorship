    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm yet to place my first order but I'm just wondering if I can get some advice on the implications of things going wrong if my package is intercepted..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in rented accommodation and regularly receive mail for tenants who no longer live here (they don't even come to collect their mail).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My thoughts are to order a package using one of these ex-tenants names so that should things go wrong I have no ties to myself, I also have the pile of mail addressed to this guy sitting in my kitchen too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any opinions on this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To say I'm a little bit nervous would be fair, I could really do with keeping a clean record!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't really see how this could go wrong?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm planning on ordering from someone who is already within the UK too, so that should help matters I guess?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice would be gratefully received :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance!!

    Using a previous tenant would be ideal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Failing that, I find the PO do not stop or look if mail going to an address has that person registered there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People move a lot. May have lodgers. My postman just delivers to my address and I have a few previous tenants whose mail still comes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ;D

    Put a woman's name down also is a good one if your a single man, not good if your married
