    Today I got a package with 50-100 cut out hearts and I didn't order them. Also they came from a state in which I have never received a package from so I don't think  a vendor sent it to the wrong person. The weirdest thing is I cant find these pills anywhere on the road.. So what could be going on here? Im pretty weirded out

    This is very strange, There was a similar thread posted yesterday which a buyer received a powder substance he never ordered, It seems to be happening a lot lately.
    <br/>
    Well look at it this way free drugs. However! And i mean this is the most important part, Somebody somewhere has your address and has not destroyed it. That is a big danger. I dont even need to get into reasons on why it is, However im telling you know you need to be careful, i would not want anybody saving my address,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    trust me be careful. get to the bottom of this shit and name and shame the prick, Fucking address keeping bastards put us all at risk. excuse the language,

    Maybe you actually became a victim of the classic SR defense. I.e. Some stranger somewhere just send you drugs and you have no idea why. It could also actually be a vendor who saved your address, shipped this one to the wrong house, and is using a different return address

    PM any vendors you recently ordered from.  It doesn't matter if it's from a state you've never gotten an order from - sometimes vendors ship from multiple different locations.  It's possible the vendor Ctrl+V'd your address onto the next order he processed.  Or he saved your address, which is unsettling.
