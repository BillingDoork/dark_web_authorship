    Ready to place my first order, done all the research so I think I am ready to go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think my order falls into the "low risk" category as it's going to be a small amount (1g MDMA) that'll ship domestically.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I gather from all my research that it's best to use your real name for shipping.  Been at my current place for about ten years now and I still get the occasional piece of mail from the previous tenant who had to be evicted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Question is, if I were to use a fake name, wouldn't using his name offer some excellent protection?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry if this is a dumb question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    Just use your real name, why take the risk of not getting what you paid for.

    Use your own name, to be honest as long as you don't sign for it then you are fine. If it gets caught with your name on it and if LE came to your house (which they wouldn't unless you were placing a very big order)  just don't sign for it as anyone can send anyone anything in the mail.

    Use your real name. You said you get the occasional piece of mail, not ALL his mail, so there's a chance the package would get forwarded on to him, or (bc it's a parcel and not a small letter) simply that the post office would catch the error and try returning it to the sender. Your first order of protection is making sure the parcel looks as much like your regular mail as possible &amp; here using your real name helps.

    you've done your research and found a top domestic vendor with excellent stealth, and you have used encryption

    now just sit back and wait for your gear. relax
