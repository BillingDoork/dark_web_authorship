    What do you think about the following:
    <br/>
    You order the stuff to some random guys house (apartment house, 10 apps +)
    <br/>
    If you can, pick some guy that is working during the day.
    <br/>
    You hang around that area for that day
    <br/>
    You have a camera on that house
    <br/>
    You see if anything weird happens when the mailman comes.
    <br/>
    You go there fast, after the mailman left
    <br/>
    You check the area
    <br/>
    put your sticky fingers in the box.
    <br/>
    get the letter
    <br/>
    leave
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you have a good vendor, order domestic and have a good postal service...? should work?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes... before some smart guy ask "what if that guy comes out of the house, bla bla bla bla bla" you have to think about that in advance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EG:
    <br/>
    Put some fake blood on your arm in advance.. if somebody comes you simply flash your arm, tell them you are injured and need some bandages. send them in the house and get your stuff from the box

    I was just thinking about this today as well. I think it would work, but if you were to do this on a regular basis you might get caught stealing their mail. Maybe if you had multiple people in different areas where you could ship to and rotate between them it would be more feasible. I'm not sure its worth the risk vs just shipping to yourself or a friend. Proceed with caution and good luck in your endeavors.

    The only way i would ever even consider trying this was if I sent it under that person's name, otherwise it may not be delivered. There's just to many better, more anonymous, safer ways to procure a drop. You can do better than that ;D

    Some of the crazy mofos on SR here do that. I mean, yeah I suppose it works out as long as there's no signature required and you can move about without raising suspicion. But leave no room for mistake, because the consequences would be ten times worse.

    Then again, USPS does have it's surprises...

    I guess alot depends on what you're having delivered, and other factors as well. One really unpredictable way to receive packs is to look up a UPS store/etc., contact them and ask them if they offer package acceptance services(they will say yes). Might cost $5. DO NOT GIVE THEM NAME/OTHER INFO. Place order using said address. Myself, I know EXACTLY when my packs will arrive, because i order from the same vendors and it ALWAYS comes in the same time frame. The day of delivery, just stroll in and grab your package, paying $5. This is really good if you think someone is on to you, but they only know of, or expect you to use a certain drop. Only you know where each one is going. Alternatively, open a VO box at similar store, and say you have a private business or the like, and send packs to "employees" or "colleagues" names. Most VO stores will gladly let you receive mail for others you deem necessary. If they say no, try the next one. It's fairly easy. I even have a PO box that isnt in my name. Just be resourceful. There's tons of good ways. But in my opinion, using some random person's house is just committing an unnecessary felony(removing mail from their box) to cover up the one you're already committing.

    well.. if u ordered the letter i dont think its stealing
    <br/>
    <br/>
    that package receiving thing is great. i did it back in some small city when doing some environmental protection work. but i got actual packages back then. german vendors are not really flexible about their shipping, only small letters. (unless you order large amounts of course)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    + i dont think it will work that easy in bigger cities because of all the carding crimes that are going on.

    If you play your cards right, getting stuff shipped to the post office is almost as safe as shipping to your home. The problem with asking UPS to accept the package and hold it would be if they opened it and found contraband. USPS is much less likely to do so, because they are government owned and must go through the proper procedures before they can open anything. Asking UPS to receive the package presents more risk because you asked them specifically to receive the package. If they found contraband it would most likely be game over, so you're kind of banking on UPS not opening your mail.

    Also UPS does not need a warrent or anything to go through your mail if they want to. So besides having to walk into a store with cameras and pick up drugs straight from the hands of another person every order, i really dont think this is a good idea. I'm sure a time or to wouldnt hurt but just seems like to many risk factors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And OP i HIGHLY suggest finding yourself another way to get your mail. Your not bringing in wepons of mass destruction lol, so just chill out and send it to your house, open a PO BOX, send it to Grandma's house or another family member.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dont USE A FAKE NAME, it can end up with vendor issues and you loosing product and money.

        I guess alot depends on what you're having delivered, and other factors as well. One really unpredictable way to receive packs is to look up a UPS store/etc., contact them and ask them if they offer package acceptance services(they will say yes). Might cost $5. DO NOT GIVE THEM NAME/OTHER INFO. Place order using said address. Myself, I know EXACTLY when my packs will arrive, because i order from the same vendors and it ALWAYS comes in the same time frame. The day of delivery, just stroll in and grab your package, paying $5. This is really good if you think someone is on to you, but they only know of, or expect you to use a certain drop. Only you know where each one is going. Alternatively, open a VO box at similar store, and say you have a private business or the like, and send packs to "employees" or "colleagues" names. Most VO stores will gladly let you receive mail for others you deem necessary. If they say no, try the next one. It's fairly easy. I even have a PO box that isnt in my name. Just be resourceful. There's tons of good ways. But in my opinion, using some random person's house is just committing an unnecessary felony(removing mail from their box) to cover up the one you're already committing.

      If you play your cards right, getting stuff shipped to the post office is almost as safe as shipping to your home. The problem with asking UPS to accept the package and hold it would be if they opened it and found contraband. USPS is much less likely to do so, because they are government owned and must go through the proper procedures before they can open anything. Asking UPS to receive the package presents more risk because you asked them specifically to receive the package. If they found contraband it would most likely be game over, so you're kind of banking on UPS not opening your mail.

     Also UPS does not need a warrent or anything to go through your mail if they want to. So besides having to walk into a store with cameras and pick up drugs straight from the hands of another person every order, i really dont think this is a good idea. I'm sure a time or to wouldnt hurt but just seems like to many risk factors.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And OP i HIGHLY suggest finding yourself another way to get your mail. Your not bringing in wepons of mass destruction lol, so just chill out and send it to your house, open a PO BOX, send it to Grandma's house or another family member.

     <br/>
     Dont USE A FAKE NAME, it can end up with vendor issues and you loosing product and money.

    They WOULD need a warrant if it was a USPS package.  Just because it's a UPS store, doesn't give them the right to open your mail, unless it was shipped specifically by UPS...

    Use a Mom &amp; Pop store for a Private Mailing Box. I have a mid-size (~4" x 6") for $42/6 mo. All I needed was a fake DL and a fake auto insurance card.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've rented a PMB from PostNet before and they didn't even ask for my ID when I applied! Really, just dress nice, play the businessperson-from-out-of-town role and you should find plenty of people willing to rent you your very own anonymous mailbox for minimal cost - cheaper than even a PO Box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would avoid renting a PO Box, as the USPS can be real bitches about forms and seem to be suspicious by nature. Go w/ the private sector, who loves your money and has no reason to be suspicious, unless they're holy-rolling, nosy busybodies. Avoid that kind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've done the borrow-a-mailbox thing before and it's a real pain. I was lucky to never get caught. Rural, isolated boxes, ideally out of sight from the owner's house, are best for this sub-optimal method. Timing can be everything and makes for a big waste of time often.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can find an isolated cluster of boxes, maybe you can get away w/ putting up your own box, complete w/ address lettering/numbers. Some mail carriers will deliver to anything with an address on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just beware of getting caught doing something inadvisable like this, trying to avoid getting caught doing something easily deniable, like having bud mailed to your home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay Safe.

    I use this method, but for people that have moved out.  Only problem I foresee is, I'm screwed if some new mailman up and decides he wants a signature for some reason.  i.e. I'm forced to go to the post office with ID.  (but would I want to go even if it was in my own name/address?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In apartment buildings like what you're asking about, 10+ units etc., there's always people moving in and out, and mail showing up for those that have long since moved away.  Even the landlord and/or super that doesn't live there will have mail delivered there.  Not to mention all the mis-delivered mail, wrong address etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Typically this mail will just collect up by the mailboxes since nobody, not even the mailman, knows what to do with it... eventually the super/landlord will just toss the stuff out or whatever, but this is irrelevant.  Imo it's much better to get packages delivered in this situation, those mailboxes in said building type are small and the mailman will just leave the package out next to the boxes/in the foyer/lobby etc. anyhow.  As long as you have access to the building, your golden.  Stuff that will fit in the mailbox, well you're at the mercy of the new resident to be law abiding and not open it... and leave it out for the landlord/mailman/whoever to handle.  (You can try just leaving off the apt # to avoid this)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Send some test blanks, try stuff out.  I haven't had an issue... and since I'm part of the complex, me picking up mail just looks normal.  I pick people that have been gone some time, that way I don't have to worry about them implementing mail forwarding.

    What JKBliss said: The UPS Store can not open your USPS first class [which includes priority and express] mail without a warrant. The USPIS can not open your USPS mail without a warrant.
    <br/>
    The UPS Store can (not acting as an agent of the law! just a concerned citizen!) certainly call LE to notify them of sketchy mail.
    <br/>
    If you're picking up General Delivery parcels at the PO, expect to show ID.
    <br/>
    Same for package acceptance services at a commercial mail receiving agency, and the ones I've been to make a copy of ID for the pick-up log.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your UPS, FedEx, DHL, Mule Carrier Service, and other common carrier parcels can be opened by the carrier for any damn reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you live somewhere that it is common to have packages sent Gen Del/package acceptance, maybe you'd blend in - this came up a lot in college towns, agriculture towns with migrant populations, etc.  Otherwise it's unusual... and you're trying to avoid standing out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Problems with mail shipped to previous tenant.
    <br/>
    It can be 1) forwarded, 2) noted as an irregularity and marked return to sender by the carrier [they do in fact get audited/checked on this stuff], 3) noted as an irregularity and therefore flagged for inspection. #1 and 2 being the most likely, but still not desired.
    <br/>
    Lot of complaints/warrants out there that cite 'missing apartment number' as an irregularity. They're in the minority, but still, it's one more thing wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if there are 10 mailboxes, with people who know when their carrier comes, you really want to take the chance of getting caught? And this being the week the guy doesn't stay home sick?
    <br/>
    My apartments have always been pretty... aware of the mailboxes, and with 10 apartments (for example), there's someone who's at home and comes down on time to check their mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Start a housesitting/dogwalking/errand business or something, perhaps? "I'll walk your dogs every day" [and, later,  offer to bring their packages in, or around to the back of the house. Starting with the mail offer would be creepy and weird.] Then be reliable and don't flake out once you get your pack. You'll have a) a reliable job, b) potentially a pool of addresses you can rotate, c) utter plausibility,  etc.
