    I have placed two orders. One last week and one today.  Both state they are in the processing stage.  What does that mean and when should I expect the delivery. I have been burned before and am concerned about these two orders.  They are supposedly to well respected sellers on this site. I emailed both sellers and have not heard back.

    Be patient.  If you are really frustrated, you could try to PM the vendor and ask for a DCN.

    If they have really good reps, it's almost impossible they would try to burn you. They're rep is worth more than that. I've had orders take 10 days before just because the USPS fucked up. Odds are they will come. Don't ask for DCN until you are ready to file a dispute. It's not wise to check a DCN on an illegal package ever, but if you feel you must to settle a dispute, wait until you are sure the package isn't coming and do it through TOR.

    Hi blue1,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the orders are still marked as 'processing' then they have not yet been sent out yet by the vendors in question. When they are sent the order status will change to 'in transit'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Silk Road gives vendors 4 days to process an order, after which point the 'cancel' link will become active and you can cancel the order if you feel that the vendor is taking too long to process it. As far as your messages are concerned a lot of vendors receive a hundred or more messages a day, and time spent reading and responding to messages is time that could otherwise be spent packaging up orders. Give your vendor 24 - 48 hours to respond to any messages, and if you want to cancel the order when the 'cancel' link becomes active then you can do so: your buyer stats will not be affected.
