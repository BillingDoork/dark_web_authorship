    I'm waiting on a shipment (sent Saturday night), domestic 1st class letter. Not particularly worried yet but I did some searching and it was actually pretty difficult to find useful information about how good RM are at delivering mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    RM targets are "93% of first class mail to be delivered next working day" and historically they have achieved anywhere between 50% and &gt;95% in a given year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I thought a straw poll here might be of future benefit for others...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, typical annoying newbie question - anyone else seeing any delays in Royal Mail atm?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Enjoy the rest of your week guys :-)

    Revealing your location isn't the wisest idea. You should try and be fairly anonymous on this forum. I know it's fairly unlikely that saying where you are from will have any repercussions but it's better to be safe than sorry!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The seller may have not actually sent it on Saturday. Don't worry about it. It should come. The royal mail are pretty good. And it shouldn't make a difference being from the North.

    95% of UK2UK 1st class mail arrives in one day.  It really is a rarity for 1st class mail to take longer than 2 working days.  Also contrary to what many people believe - only 1 in 1000 CORRECTLY ADDRESSED letters are lost by Royal Mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I agree with Naloxone though - I really wouldn't worry.  Many vendors will mark an order as "in transit" well before they actually post it.  By doing this they appear efficient and speedy and any delays can be blamed on Royal Mail.

     I live in London. Good luck LEA finding me amongst one of the most populated cities in the world with one of busiest mailing centres in the world. I'm not worried at all about revealing that because VPN's, Tor, encryption and plenty of other precautions have been taken. My stuff doesn't get delivered to my home and I don't pick it up myself. DPR's at more risk than I am.

    Yeah. I guess I'm just overly paranoid. All that cannabis... But I just feel that if the law enforcers ever get hold of your account and somehow manage to associate it with you then every post with personal information would be used against you to incriminate you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also feel DPR is more at risk than a lot of us!

    How would you recommend to send mail safely and securely?

    With first class recorded or special delivery obviously there is a high chance your product will get there but if you're sending illicit stuff then it's whether you want to have that added risk of going to the post office with your package. Could be traced back a bit easier. Not that there is much chance of that with domestic postage but it depends how paranoid you are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think there is any difference between 1st class and 2nd in terms of success of delivery. They're both pretty good.

    It is possible to send recorded and special delivery items without necessarily having to go to the post office, it just requires a bit of roundabout thinking to do the latter in a secure way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For recorded though you can get recorded delivery stamps and fill out the tracking bit yourself. That's how it's done for bulk mail in a lot of places anyway.
