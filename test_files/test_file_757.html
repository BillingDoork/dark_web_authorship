    I had a pack sent the 9th from netherlands, and one from belgium sent on the 13th. The one from belgium beat the package from the netherlands, WTF?! WHY, they're right next to eachother? Maybe customs holds packages from NL longer to inspect them? Im getting worries =[ meow hopefully they didnt get me 30g of MDMA

    Sorry if this makes no sense free ket sample came.

    It depends, was one from belguim a smaller pack?  Also, yes NL is a well known country for their major drug trade! Hence it may just be held up. They did have storm nemo in new york. Had a shit load of snow, lost power for a day. Maybe backed up, Maybe one just slipped threw. Maybe one slipped threw?
    <br/>
    Also did either have tracking&gt; if so that can be a major factor! I have ordered from both, once got one from be in 6 days once 3 weeks. Nl once 7 days once 30days. So may factors. but i hope for my time and since no one else answered you could throw me positive +1 a karma point:)

    i'm british so i don't know really. some people say mail from NL is flagged in the USA and will have greater scrutiny. i've never had one stopped but then i'm within the EU. some people are cautious, some overcautious it's hard to say which is which but the fact that a lot of dutch vendors have changed their shipping locations to germany/belgium says something about the success rates!

    There are so many factors. Are you going by the actual postmarks though or just when the vendor mark dispatched?

    I too expected to come into this thread &amp; make fun of the silly American who didn't know about European countries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shows us eh.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously there could be a lot of reasons for delays, different postal systems, timescales &amp; security checks in the two countries, postal service industrial action - it happens, Dutch packages getting a more thorough going over in customs, vendors using different values of postage/different services, post only being flown out to your country every few days &amp; your package just missing the window.

    i think that thread would have been more fun.
    <br/>
    let's just pretend like that was the real question. i want to say i'm massively biased towards the netherlands, hello nederwiet! coffeeshops, chips and mayo, edam, gouda, so much cheeese, bikes, picturesque canals, febos kaassouffle, krokets, pretty much everyone can speak english, feminism took hold so strongly here you never get hassled by dutch men. downside the wietpass was bullshit and now us damn foreigners can't buy weed in many border towns even though it was abolished. RLD is grimy and sketchy as hell, geert wilders far right populism, need i say more?
    <br/>
    belgium mmmm mussels, again chips and mayo (apparently home of "french fries" discovered by an american), world famous chocolate, great beer(not for me), brussels pate easily best pate in the world, groezrock, pukkelpop.. but they speak 3 languages or something for a country that small.. french, flemish and dutch, correct me if i'm wrong but that shit is bonkers and brussels smells like piss.
    <br/>
    you can tell i'm not the kinda museum and art gallery kind of traveler haha

    Well, Belgium is a lower profile country, and by own experience it has been faster than the Netherlands.
    <br/>
    This might be because of different postal systems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Netherlands is the capital of most drugs, and also makes it a worse place to order from, by my own experience it has been slower than others also and ive had 1 letter missing from there.
