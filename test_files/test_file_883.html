    If your packages are doing through US west coast customs, then some of them are going to get caught.  They actually use the xray on some packages and they've caught a lot of steroid shipments over the years.  If they see vials on the scanner then it is just that much more obvious.  Vials just aren't going to make it through the xray.

    Vials are difficult to reliably get through customs so in my estimation the vast majority of steroids are sent to the US as powder and then made into vials in the US either for personal use or for resale.  The customs center you're going through makes a huge difference and many steroid distributors flat out refuse to ship packages that are going to go through the difficult customs centers (based on origin and destination zip code).  For the customs center that is more difficult it is important to at least ship in smaller quantities to lessen the probability of a controlled delivery for your customers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My experience is that if customs finds liquid using the x-ray then they are doing to check the package.  I don't know much about x-ray so I'm unsure about liquid x-ray stealth.  It does seem like dry vials get through easier than liquid vials though.

    I've ordered tons of steroids, vials + pills, never gotten seized and most of the vendors don't use any stealth at all, never gotten anything that was even vacuum sealed. USA customs should be pretty easy, west coast I hear is the toughest. Australia is in a different league all together. I think it's beat practice to make the package small, flat/smooth surface. If they x-ray it, it's almost guaranteed they're gonna see the vials/liquid. Shipping from the UK is a plus, it's not a flagged country, if your were shipping from Thailand it'd be a different story, but I've gotten vials simply dropped in yellow padded envelopes sent from Thailand to me and I received them just fine lol.
