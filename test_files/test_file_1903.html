    i also got love letter #1 recently. i'm assuming doing nothing will lead to nothing. i'm assuming they won't follow through with anything. is a wrong assumption. buying from NE is the stupiest thing i could have done. is this going to affect domestic US packages?

    Can't divulge deets, but I had no idea anything was even coming to me.  Dated just last week.  Also tells me what was seized.

    Advice:  LAY LOW for a good amount of time.
