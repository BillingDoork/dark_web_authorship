    Hey everyone,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just received a package. everything looked fine except for two holes on the side of the envelope as if it was filed somewhere. (Google "ring binder" and you'll know what i mean).
    <br/>
    I PMed the vendor asking about these holes - only to get a short reply of "nop." (not made by him)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyone have any guesses on why are these holes there? You could peek inside the envelope through the holes - but with no danger of exposing the content.
    <br/>
    The inner seals and package was not touched at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My paranoid sense is tingling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance to all repliers!

    I've gotten what I assumed to be holes from a hole puncher on my envelopes before, some people speculate that some post offices hang letters in a certain order, and that's why it was hole punched. Other say that maybe certain packages get an initial red flag from something basic like country of origin or whatever, hole punch it to see if the dog can sniff it then or maybe shine a light in the package. Most vendors use a few layers of stealth or MBBs which usually would protect it from that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way I've never seen/read of it being an issue

    You guys seriously have never heard of this? Customs have been pocking hole punches in envelopes for years to check if any contraband falls out. It is a very quick way for them to check and it is impossible to prove they actually damaged the letter...I package things the way I do to make sure even if hole punched they won't find it....It is not very uncommon at all.

    So what i understand here is that customs try to poke around the envelope, but it got to me safely thanks to the inner-stealth?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never got anything punched holed before.

    I received a package from Germany with a decent sized hole punch.  Stealth was good enough to get to me.

    I've seen these smaller sized holes before on legit international orders. I don't think it's anything to really worry about as long as there is some stealth involved.

    I had a friend who didn't understand the whole "NL to US is a bad idea" thing and received two EXTREMELY small plastic packages from a vendor who I believe is still active.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Both of them had what looked exactly like a hole punched...hole...at the top and middle of the package. He showed them to me asking what they were, and I'd say they were about 1/4" diameter each.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Standard practice - either they take a rake-like group of sharp points and stamp a bunch of holes through the letter and reagent test the tips, or they punch and hole in it and take a peek/smell. This is why ordering from countries of suspicious origin (as cheap as they may be) is probably not a good idea. My friend was about 1 inch from having their "half price moonrocks!" spill out of the letter in customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor didn't seem to care once it was explained to him...he just changed the label on the package but used the exact same, highly suspect packaging to keep on keepin' on.
