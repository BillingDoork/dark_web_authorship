    Hey all...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just wondering if anyone has had any negative or position feedback in relation to Supertrips getting product through you Australia??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I remember a thread not so long ago where people said it wasnt getting through ... through now with larger orders he will do them in escrow (not much risk on my side) ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    opinions?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also just in general anyone recieved any good white from O/S lately?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Few mates who are regular on SR always getting their product from Canadian vendors... 100% arrival ... then like 2 month ago it started going down and down and down - now they are purchasing at all from there .... LE must have cottoned on ... meh
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hit me back

    Canada has faced a bit of heat just prior to one of SR's best ever coke vendor's, MoveItNice,(fuck wish he was still around) was busted and his operation shut down. It's been talked about in Canadian papers about a crack down on drugs, mainly crystal meth and cocaine, being both imported and exported from Canada. Supertrips, I'm pretty sure, was a vendor from The Netherlands who relocated his operation to Germany (good move I think). The only problem you have is his minimum order to Aust. is U.S $2000 which is a little under 1 OZ of Cocaine. If your prepared to import that much at once that's your choice, but I'd take my time and think very carefully on how you intend to do it. :)
