    I have a number of buyers that come from down under, and I do my best to get make sure your packages get through. I've read all the shipping threads that have been posted, the postal profiling bulletins, and change my packaging regularly. I've ordered from different vendors where the feedback has specifically mentioned how stealthy their packaging is. I've used various methods of concealment, different envelope shapes &amp; styles, shipped documents &amp; parcels and used multiple couriers for delivery. And I'm constantly looking for new methods to add to my shipping arsenal. And it occurs to me, who better to know how to pack, ship and send to Australia than the very buyers who are placing and receiving orders every day and who know what mail blends in and what sticks out, and most important of all, what's getting delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I'd like to hear from any of you how have placed and order for pills, pot or powder. How was it packed? Was it vacuum sealed or wrapped in some sort of enclosure or protective covering? Were there multiple layers? What type of envelope was used? Standard business mailer, bubble mailer, padded mailer or rigid mailer? What color was it? What colors are commonly used? What colors stick out and should be avoided? Maybe it was sent as a parcel. What was in the parcel? Was it hidden inside of something else? What concealed the item? How was it declared on the customs form? What was the value? How much was sent (quantity/weight/volume/etc). How much is too much per package? What worked about the packaging? What did you like? What did you dislike? What should be avoided. Any and all information you can provide so I have more options at my disposal to get your packaged through to you. I DO NOT need to know the vendor that shipped to you, only how the packaged was sent. If you have pictures, so much the better. You can email them to me at mjmuse@tormail.net. Just be sure to cover up the sender address, destination address and to scrub any metadata from the picture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unfortunately, sharing info such as this is not something to be openly discussed on the forums, for obvious security reasons. No need to let the powers that be see this info as it will only help them stop more deliveries. So I request, if your willing to share this info with me, please send me a PM, either here or on the SR main site.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In exchange for this information, I will provide you with an SR Gift Code, the amount to be determined by how useful, unique and practical the information is. The more detailed, creative and easy to implement it is, the bigger the Gift Code. And it won't be a Gift Code specific to my vendor account, you'll be able to spend it at any vendor on the site, for anything you want.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please send any such messages with a subject header of Australian Shipping so I can find the message easily amongst all the other messages I receive. And again, please do not post shipping details in this thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    He asked for the information to be passed onto him/her through PM. I see no issue with this, he looks like a well trusted seller. Aussie fucking relax a bit, this guy is clearly on our side, in USA any fuck can get anything off the street (well at least thats what I have assumed) so for US/Canada sellers can make good coin from us and their prices are awesome compared to local, so what is wrong with the guy trying to help us in turn helping him? Its what this whole site is about really (helping = making money/ getting products)

    All good bro, just sounded like you were basically trying to get the thread shut down. I would agree with you if the OP wasnt a trusted seller.

    I  really respect a vendor who is researching the market, looking to improve and implement  suggestions made  by people on the coal face of this "industry". I'm sure some creative, ingenious ideas will be heading your way.
