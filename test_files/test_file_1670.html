    When I go to check the tracking for my package, it reads:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Processed Through Sort Facility
    <br/>
    July 11, 2012, **** pm
    <br/>
    ISC **********(USPS)
    <br/>
    Registered Mail™
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I left the actual location out for security purposes. It is now the 16th and there hasn't been any more updates. It just seems like 5 days or more would be more than enough time for the package to make it to me, but nothing yet. After doing some research, I have found that Registered Mail is the most secure method and can slow down the process (especially International). I also have heard that it may take anywhere from 3 days to a week from the time that it was "processed through the sorting facility" for it to show up. I just want to know if any of you can chime in on this and clarify the situation for me. This type of shipping does not guarantee end-to-end visibility, so it may very well not show another status update until the item has been delivered. Also, if the item has already been processed through the sorting facility, then that would mean that it should be on its way to my local PO, correct? Therefore, it would have already passed the security screenings and I shouldn't have to worry about it being seized? Am I right to think this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

    It means it should be on the way to your PO box then. I`d say its safe to assume it will arrive safely.

    It goes through a sort facility on the sender's end and then through a sort facility on your end (where it will be sent to your route carrier). The location of the sort facility should have been listed (and redacted by you). Was it the initial or end sort facility? If it was the last stage, I would assume you should be receiving soon. If this was international, I'm not familiar with the particulars of that, but assume it can take some time.

    My experience domestically had been with Priority mail with a DCN.  I was able to see an update a day. There was an issue with my package so I got to see a lot of days of updates before eventually receiving but still. Even if there was an issue with the address, I could see that through the update.

    If the only update was an international sort facility and then nothing, then a customs issue is likely.  If it was updated at a domestic sort facility, then it should be clear of customs.

    Was this a large order from over seas?

    Yes, a large order from overseas and yes, it was updated at a domestic sort facility. I think it will be okay. Hopefully, it will be here any day now.
