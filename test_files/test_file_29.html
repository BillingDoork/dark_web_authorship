    So , today I received my order but it was m367 aka hydrocodone 10mg. I ordered Percocet  10mg. I emailed the vendor just waiting to hear back. My question is , do issues like this get resolved easily? The vendor has a 100% rating so I feel better about the situation I just feel a tad ripped off, the price difference for these 2 drugs on here is big.

    What was the quantity you received? It could have been a simple mistake. If the vendor wants to keep his 100 rating, I'm sure he'd be willing to do something to fix this issue.

    I received 10 pills of Vicodin but I paid for 10 pills of Percocet 10mg. If the vendor does not respond, do I have any recourse or should I just drop it ?

    What I suggest you do is give it 4 days and then leave a 3/5 as feedback. Mention in the feedback that you will change it to a 5 once the vendor contacts you to resolve the issue, as you already contacted him and gave adequate time to respond.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck! Please be open to something like a half refund or getting 5 percs sent to you, as I doubt there is any way the vendor will ask for you to send them back.  8)

    Thanks for your advice! I would gladly take 5 , I'm not greedy and I think that would make the price I paid almost fair. :-)

    Ouch man that sucks....hydrocodone does absolutely nothing for me so if I was in your situation I would be pissed to receive that instead of the oxycodone. The vendor you ordered from should have no problem fixing the problem though because it was their mistake...just stay cool/polite about it and hopefully it works out okay :). Good luck!
