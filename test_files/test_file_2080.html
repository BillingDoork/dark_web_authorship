    I don't have many packages headed my way, and am pretty sure an attempted delivery that resulted in a "Postage Due: $1.05" notice on a peach slip from the USPS is regarding a package here from SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package is being held at the local post office for pickup. Question is: should I actually go and pick it up now that it's been subject to additional scrutiny, or just have them send it back to the sender?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Needless to say I'm not too happy with the idiocy on part of the vendor (who I won't name) for improper postage. Any similar experiences? Advice? Please help! Thanks.

    I suggest contacting the vendor and obtaining information about the package to determine if there truly is postage due.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Probably safe to pick it up regardless. creating setup tricks like a phony postage due notice is not the standard operating procedure for postal inspectors or police. If they were going to bust you, they would do a "controlled delivery".
