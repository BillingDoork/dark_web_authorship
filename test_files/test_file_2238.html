    Anyone know how this works?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping domestic is easy because you just pay for the delivery confirmation with extra postage, but how does that work with international packages?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can I pay for the delivery confirmation and then just get confirmation that it's left the country? Obviously it won't have tracking once it's left the country but it would still nice to see that it's gone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I just leave off the confirmation?

    I asked this question very recently as well, The answers i got are something like this...
    <br/>
    You can just send packages within the EU with one first class stamp, as long as it is under 100g.
    <br/>
    going international outside the EU you need to put more stamps on , im not sure you find out how many? maybe a simple clearnet search will put that straight?
    <br/>
    Op what do you mean you pay for confirmation with extra postage? I take it your meanig a tracked item. But i was under the impression that you just paid a bit more for tracking and that was it, am i wrong?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im not 100% on sending interationally and there seems to be little advice on it, relating to specifics, maybe an idea for a thread to be written by a hero member and stickied. :D
