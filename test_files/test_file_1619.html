    It appears that Canada Post is not authorized to open domestic parcels.

    According to one of the Canadian Silkroad vendors,

     "Canada Customs can inspect mail items entering Canada from other countries. Upon inspection of the item, a Canada Customs Inspected stamp will be affixed to the item. When an item is defaced or open, Canada Post staff will stamp or otherwise mark the item to indicate that it was open or slightly damaged when received. This stamp or notation should not be mistaken for evidence that the item was deliberately opened. In order to request an enquiry, the Customer should retain the envelope or wrapping and call Customer Service at 1.800.267.1177."

    So I'm a bit confused. Does Canada Post inspect domestic mail or not?

    "entering Canada from other countries" ... does not apply to Domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, "the Canada Post Corporation" absolutely has the right to open mail according to the Canada Post Corporation Act.  Only under the circumstances clearly stated therein, of course.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Law and practice are separate matters of course, and the defacto truth is that Canada Post only opens mail if they have reason to believe it is hazardous or non-mailable.  Good packaging is always important, and ripped packages are what you should really be worried about.  Torn letters and packages absolutely happen, and that baggie of weed the way some vendors package it is going to be pretty obvious when a postie is taping the envelope back up.  Will that individual care is another question... but don't tempt fate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is the relevant Canada Post Corporation Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-10) excerpt:

     Inspection of Mail
     <br/>
     <br/>
     41. (1) The Corporation may open any mail, other than a letter, to determine in any particular case
     <br/>
     (a) whether the conditions prescribed by regulations made pursuant to paragraph 19(1)(c) have been complied with;
     <br/>
     (b) whether the manner prescribed by regulations made pursuant to paragraph 19(1)(e) has been adhered to; or
     <br/>
     (c) whether the mail is non-mailable matter.

     <br/>
     (2) The Corporation may open any undeliverable mail, including any undeliverable letters.

    Here is it broken down:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (1) Canada Post Corporation may open any mail, other than a letter, to determine [...] whether the mail is non-mailable matter. [Seriously, those middle parts are just about giving Canada Post Corporation the power to determine what is mailable in a limited way.]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (2) Canada Post Corporation may open any undeliverable mail, including any undeliverable letters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Summarily, any agent of Canada Post Corporation (any postie), is therefore lawfully entitled to open your mail, if pursuant to Canada Post internal policies.  Canada Post internal policies suggest that mail should not be opened under most circumstances.
