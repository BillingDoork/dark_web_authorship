    If the fake name is really fake then you can easily be fucked. If you used the name of a neighbor or someone near by, then maybe you can try and fuck someone else over. Either way be prepared to pay the pied piper.

    I've sent numerous domestic and international packages out with fake names before.  I've never had one of those seized that I know of so I can't tell you.  I even sent someone a package with the name Mario Kart before because that is what they insisted on...

    if someone happens to get to the mail before you (spouse, children, parents, whatever) and they aren't aware of your ordering methods/habits, you run the risk of someone returning to sender. same is true for using a neighbors name. they might not be cool with recieving your mail and return to sender instead of bringing it to your address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    your best bet is to know when your mail arrives and be there to retrieve it, or to accept it if the postal worker wants to ask you about the name (you have a roommate now, or something).

    postal worker that normally delivers to houses know the names usually or has a idea who lives their they do that rout everyday of the work day, so they will report it. or they might take it is a chance. also someone might return to sender because someone else got it before you

    Was only trying to help you child.....never said I was wise.    My argument is not worth the time to type it to you is all I'm saying because of the way you act when people actually try to tell you the proper way to go about it.

    <br/>
    Conclusion is you don't listen to ideas that you can't comprehend so that makes everyone retarded because you are the smart one here.   Suggest you work on your grammar along with your list of fake name's and addresses and please don't post asking where's  my package?   when You continue to put a fake name and address in the shipping details.    Stupid is as Stupid does as they say Slash.

    Surely a fake name is better, just on the offchance the package gets intercepted. I only use my real name on domestic orders as theres no customs to go through. I've used a fake name on international orders multiple times and its always been fine; although i suppose this depends on the country you live in and how their respective postal services work.

    Every house/flat i've ever lived in has mail sent through in the previous tenant/owners name....they always leave something attached to the address, so i just send it through in their name.

    The fundamental principal is you are innocent until proven guilty, and it is not a crime to be sent mail, illegal or not. If in doubt deny, deny, deny.

    From a vendors point of view, real name and address means it has the highest chance of getting through/past your postman. From the customers point of view, it makes little difference if you are prepared for a knock on the door. "I have no idea what you are talking about" goes a long way.
