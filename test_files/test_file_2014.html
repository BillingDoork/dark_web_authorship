    I think this is the only thing that is preventing me from pulling the trigger. How safe is it to use your residence address for receiving shipments? I mean you can't really get around this can you? This is the risk one has to take? Still, it gets me very paranoid to think they will be dissecting the package or you know authorities getting involved and so on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If someone can point me to appropriate threads regarding this, seeing that search is taking forever to load results, I'm sure this has been fully discussed before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have read the wiki, FAQ, and a few threads so far which tells you to write, "Return to Sender" and wait a few days before opening the package...but I mean what if they bust down your door. Really don't want lawyers getting involved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I overly paranoid here?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you.

    Safe enough.  It's safer than trying to do sketchy things like use fake names or have deliveries go to abandoned addresses.  As long as you're using a reputable vendor with secure packaging methods then everything should be good.  You always have plausible deniability.  Anyone can send you anything without your knowledge.

    hamtaro, I'm of the opinion that using a previous resident's name is the way to go, if you can.  Mail comes to my box consistently with their name on it, and I've been at this address for a good many years now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do add "or Current Resident" to the name, in case the previous resident files a "Change of Address" with the Post Office out of the blue.  This also means I can only receive letter size packages from USPS, which means confirming shipping method with the vendor first, and limiting the size of my orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd love to hear more from experienced SR buyers, and shippers, on this issue.  Like you, I'm an SR newbie and it's the only thing I'm paranoid about.

    Thanks for the word of assurance guys! I spent all night reading similar threads and I am convinced that
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) reputable and successful vendor
    <br/>
    2) safe packaging
    <br/>
    <br/>
    are essential. One last piece of the puzzle is, how do you avoid giving away your signature to the delivery man who asks you to simply "sign here please". How do you talk yourself out of signing the package? What happens if you don't bother answering the door, will they leave it out the door or tell you a notice to come to the post office and pick up the package (nerve wrecking!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it possible to have it just mailed directly to your mailbox if the contents are small enough to fit?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What shipping method guarantees that you don't need to sign and don't need to meet the mailman?

    Hi there fellow newbie! I'm glad that there is someone with largely same concerns.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for using previous resident's name, that is actually a very good idea. I hope that other's can pitch in on this idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My only concern for this is the resident situation and what is the difficulty of finding out the previous resident's name (assuming that's all one needs). For example, what if you lived on a rented apartment? Would you write Joe Smith or Current Resident? Would the mail still end up coming to you or would they check if Joe Smith indeed lives there and deliver it to wherever he lives? I'm not really sure how the logistics of these things work, it's a fascinating idea.

    You won't need to sign when receiving packages, ever, and if you do then don't sign and say that you didn't order it and you don't know what it is. The only time you will ever need to sign is if the seller specifies that they want you to, mostly to ensure you get a package (sites like NewEgg do it because they ship expensive things). SR sellers won't do that, and if you sign that links you to the package.. A nono

    I disagree with the advice about using a former residents name and "or current resident".  It's too easy to have a package forwarded or returned to sender by a mail person "doing you a favor".  Also never have "or current resident" put on a package instead of a letter as that poster said.  It's suspicious because only business mail is sent that way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As syncd said, no SR vendor will have you sign for a package but I have heard of it happening with some international orders in which the shipper didn't realize that it would be required in the receiving country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are other threads on this very subject.  Real name, real address is the way to go.  Unless you're ordering a large amount of cannabis or something that takes up a lot of space (don't do that), most packages (priority box and 1st class letters) will fit into a standard mailbox.

    This is the only thing keeping me from pulling the trigger as well, but you say it's safe? Just the thought of not having legitimate denability.....The max I would do is a oz, if I decided to do it It would be coming from a very reputable seller in canada (to the us).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So as long as there is no signature required I am good? Say even if it is delivers by usps and I am physically handed it?

    You guys need a less violent metaphor for ordering than "pulling the trigger".  Look, what we're doing here is illegal.  Nothing is going to be 100% safe.  Read the threads on package security.  Read the reviews and feedback for your chosen vendor, they usually mention the quality of packaging.  Read the former posts in this thread.  If you're scared, then don't order.

    That makes total sense. I'll have to spend some time thinking about it. The seller does seems to be a++ all around especially for packing.

    Pricing is less than half of what I would pay for just standard heads here, so I might have to place a bet (better metaphor? lol).

    I find it quite amusing and paradoxical one's chances are improved by using real name and address while seeking anonymity, however I believe this is actually for the best as many others have pointed out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ideally, it would be the most desirable to have a small amount (no more than 25 pills of aspirin at any given time and probably way less to begin with just to test) delivered directly to the mailbox. The question is with the additional packaging for security reasons, would it fit? I wouldn't dare order anything large such an ounce of grass.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What mailing options can I request or suggest to guarantee that the package is delivered to my mailbox and not in person by the mailman? This would be the most highly desirable solution as it is discreet.

    As long as the package is small enough, the postman will just drop it in your box, it makes his job easier! Never had a postman come to the door for a small package like batteries or cases, but of course this may vary depending on your post and postman.

    It is unfuckingbelievable how many people here in the SHIPPING section offer up advice on subjects they have absolutely no idea of.   The name of the game is ANONYMITY!!  How the fuck can anyone in their right mind think the best odds of keeping their freedom lay in openly attaching their name and address to their illegal activity??  WTF people?  This is nothing short of mind boggling.  The honest truth is---&gt; it is NEVER safe to ship or receive drugs in the mail.  Never forget that. That doesn't mean you can't do it.  Odds are you won't get caught but that is only because of the sheer volume of mail being circulated daily.  That by no means makes it safe.  All one can do is minimize the risk and the key to that is anonymity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't be sucked into false sense of assurance based on some twisted sense of apparent concurrence amongst  some members.  The overwhelming majority of SR members are new to the scene and simply lack the experience and knowledge required to give sound and intelligent advice on many, many topics.  So what there are lots of people saying real name/real address is the way to go.   It just means lots of people are wrong.  Common sense alone should send one's bullshit meter skyrocketing when told to write your name and address on your illegal shipments.

    From my experience, yes it is safe to use your real address to receive drugs. I have been a member of SR for over one year and have received more than 10 packages safely at my real address. The only shipment that didn't arrive was my very first order, where I used the name of a previous tenant.

    I've done this before with no issue---the key is that it can't be a very recent previous tenant, as 1) they may have forwarding set up 2) The carrier may know they are gone and 'fix' it themselves.  The key to doing this is only use a prior tenant name if you regularly get their junk mail (in their name)--that way another item fits the pattern of mail going there.

    The only reason you say its safe is because you've never been busted yet. Even in the case customs does open the package whether or not they are going to do anything about depends on the size of your order in most cases. They may even start watching you for a while, repackage without their green tape. I've heard of that happening. I've only had 2 packages fucked with both from china. One was a battery, they opened it, left my package on my doorstep at around 10PM at night. It made no sense at all. Mail carriers don't deliver that late? But I got a notification from USPS through email that said "left on doorstep", sure enough, 10pm at night I open the door and there is my laptop battery cracked open and pressed back together in a ripped plastic bag with no bubble wrap or anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The second package was in customs for a long time. (About one week) No holiday, or reason for delay so I knew something was up. The package contained several HGH kits among "steroid raw materials". Well, the package arrived with green tape that said "Inspected by DHS Customs and Border Protections) They put the HGH and everything that they cut out of the bubble wrap back in and delivered it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess my point of this is: you never know. I've been doing this for many years... For a couple years I used to receive packages to my house. But now I've got more to lose and I've gotten safer at what I do. It's cheap to get a private mail box, so why would you even want to risk the slim chance of customs seizing you're package and the feds coming to your door to make an example out of you?

    couple of months here, about 20 shipments, one no show, no issues.  before I started, I sent letters, small packages to house with chosen real sounding name. When all arrived after couple of weeks, I started placing orders from vendors with good SR cred.  If package seemed suspect to me, stopped using the vendor.  I also travel a lot and have had sent to my hotel with my name, that to me is a good system because I get mail a lot on the road and the hotel accepts it, so mix in a a few 8-b and all is good.  One time I had a concern because of shitty packaging that could have been opened and resealed, I put return to sender, set it beside the door for a day and did not use the vendor again,  Just my 2 cents....still new....don't order large quantities, so probably not worth the time for LE, but still would rather stay off the grid and get my happy letter....

    The safest way to assure your order gets to you is to use your real name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your stupid paranoid for some reason you can switch out a letter of your first or last name, or abbreviate your first name, eg J. Smith.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the police really are watching you it makes no difference what name is on the package, they won't use that as evidence against you if they charge you, they'll use whatever evidence it was they received that tipped it off to you in the first place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using an old tenant's name or a completely fake name is what's going to tip your mail carrier off.  They look at hundreds of letters a day and have to sort them, this being time consuming, and since they've already delivered 100 phone bills or whatever to your address they just sort kind of auto-pilot in the back of their van, and it's only when they see a different name to an address they are used to seeing another name that they pause in sorting to check it out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some mail carriers don't care, some will steal it, some will report it !

    This is what every new buyer should be doing. Get people to mail you some test packages using the name/address you want to use for SR, before attempting any SR orders. If there's going to be problems delivering mail you'll find out before wasting your money and taking legal risk.

    This is so true for UK, NL, FR, US, AU, and CA buyers who seem to have a multitude of vendors stocking just about everything you can think of. It's worth it to pay more for your drugs to avoid customs losses, address flagging, and law enforcement investigations. Domestic orders from vendors with good ratings are almost 99% guaranteed to arrive as the domestic mail isn't inspected in the same way it is when crossing international borders and going through customs agencies. Your chances of receiving an order in AU from overseas is probably less than 50%.

    Stupid question:
    <br/>
    I'm in Italy, which is notorious for stolen packages. Using tracked/guaranteed mail (without bothering to actually track it online) seems to be the best device against this, but does tracked mail usually require a signature? If so, why do some vendors offer it?

    Everyone has their own opinion on this. Here's mine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Truth is, like any decision you make in life, it all depends on your current situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Living in suburbia? Your mailman probably knows the 400 names on his route by heart. He works the same route day in day out, for multiple years on end. He probably has every house already profiled based on the mail they get. The families behind on their bills, the ones who travel a lot, etc. If someone writes the wrong address on a letter it will probably make it to your house anyway because he knows your name. Probably best in this situation to use your real name because sketchy letters with stamps and priority stickers, some coming from abroad often with a noticeable bulge when felt closely, are already uncommon enough. Don't toss a random name into the mix to make him think about it more. If he is cool, this probably wouldn't matter and would know what's up. But if he wasn't you could be setting yourself up for trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Living in the city, especially a poor or student area? Go right ahead. People change addresses all the time. I would recommend this as someone could be trying to 'steal your mail' if the authorities caught wind.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Exceptions apply. Some countries (and maybe cities in the USA) legally require the mailman to check the name on the doorbell, or else hold the letter in the post office to be picked up with ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All and all though as long as you don't do anything international you are running a very very low risk. These letters never see a human's hands until the postman is walking up to your door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't sweat it, especially for something small. And just deny if you are the unlucky bastard who gets a knock on the door. It does happen, but very very rare.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my opinion shipping pot is probably most likely to get you caught. It's bulky and smelly, and larger amounts won't go through the automatic sorting machines. Powders are probably almost never caught when properly packed
