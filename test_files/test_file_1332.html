    Just now, in the middle of the second day of my current meph binge,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The postman comes knocking on my door, calls my name and tells me that i need to sign something -
    <br/>
    and the feeling i felt at this very moment was: pure Joy, felt Relaxed, comfortable and secured...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    cause today i knew i already got all my open SR orders so it cant be CD or any other trouble,   i just imagine myself if it was the same situation -  im high, waiting for more drugs to come and the postman asks me to sign (this is extremely rare - maybe once in few years)  i would have shit myself. if it was just a few days earlier when i was concerned anyway due to some delayed package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, that was fun,  those little things that can make big difference :)

    I've not yet read anything reputable that would indicate that signing for a parcel could be proof of anything. I'm in the school of thought that refusing to sign and tweaking out is substantially more suspicious behavior than just acting cool and signing.

    This train of thought needs to stop. I have never read a news article about a drug bust and the mail system without the words "after signing for the package, officers." The fact is, the current persistent pattern of busting people is via face to face. They don't sit outside your mailbox all day. If your mailman knocks on your door, you should be very very careful. Mailmen are on a tight schedule, and some are lazy. They just don't make people sign for packages for the hell of it. If you have ever had a package from amazon that required a signature, then you know the mailman is usually pretty annoyed with the fact that he has to have you sign for something, and does not even wait for you to finish signing before he snatches his little pdf out of your hands and runs back to his truck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If a vendor forgets to waive the signing, he should refund the order in full after a buyer refuses delivery. Yeah, it may be suspicious to return to sender, but its a fair trade considering the other route. If its ever brought up why you rejected the shipment, many reasons could be said. One is your girlfriends ex keeps try to get you arrested etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't sign, ever.

    Doesnt matter if you sign or not. Once they bothered and came to your house to make a CD
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You will be searched.

    You will be arrested.
    <br/>
    You will be interrogated.

    The signature is a small additional evidence, not critical as the court knows pretty well that anyone will sign a letter that is addressed to them, and thats it pretty weird when someone refuses to sign a letter on hes name,

    It doesnt matter as you will have exactly 3 seconds after you sign or refuse to sign before they bust in.

    This is not at all logical. You can't be arrested if you refuse the delivery and never take possession. This is the point of a controlled delivery, to get you to get possession of the drugs so they can arrest you. YOU HAVE COMMITTED NO CRIMES IF DRUGS ARE MAILED TO YOU! Now consider what I just said. If someone, "unknown" to you, ships you drugs, you have done nothing wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When cops do a CD do they know you were expecting the drugs? Yeah, but thats not illegal. They loophole the law system and arrest you despite having possession on a drug for only a very short time.  After arrest they build a case/interrogate you. Usually after arrest they can get warrants to search home and find proof you knowingly requested the drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your getting arrested and searched anyways, I doubt police would bother with a CD. They would smash in your door jam or simply knock on your door in uniform.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police also do not usually wait to get a warrant before performing a controlled delivery. I'm not going to tell you to trust me on this one, but I will offer that I have many years of being involved and keeping watch over the news of the postal system and arrests.

    Dont you agree that if they have a package filled with drugs with your name on it,
    <br/>
    Its somewhat of more than enough for a reasonable suspicion to have you at least interrogated?
    <br/>
    And that if you refuse it more of a reason to ask you why are you refusing?...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The CD part exist  to get harder evidence (possess it, open it, etc...), thats why they do it, and there are few types of them, it depend on the situation but its not everything.  im not triyng to convince you, make your own choices (which it really doesnt matter if you sign or not) but i know these stuff not from my assumptions and logic but from real time experience of myself and quite a few more people and with dealing quite a bit with lawyers and courts.

    Im only saying this so people will not think that if they don't sign its like a magic that makes the police to just leave you.. Oh, no they wont. And people need to know this, im sure you can why this situation looking a bit fishy  in the eyes of LE.  Even if you come out clean in court - it will still be after a cery unpleasent process

    From the Official Controlled Delivery, they state that a Judge will be on hand to sign the search warrant after the Controlled Delivery has been made,  and the person opened the drug package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have no obligation to open the door to anyone without warrant.  WHY even be around when delivery is expected.  If they want to attempt a controlled delivery at 11:15PM, you can safely assume its a setup,  and refuse it.  Do not accept it, or even open the screen door.  Tell the nice men how much you enjoyed their company,  but its late and you're going to bed.  Good night officers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do not talk to any officers that come to door, just to ask questions.  That means they lack probable cause for a search, and need you to provide it.  Good night officers.  If they suggest you come on down to chat, tell  them would be happy to talk to them after consulting with legal counsel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Till then, say nothing except "I'm going to bed"

    It pretty naive to think those things are woking like described above you think they dont have their tricks? :)
    <br/>
    "Hope for the best but prepare for the worse" Thats the only thing i can say, if you guys wish to believe that you are immune to being searched or arrested just because you refuse signing, thats fine. In that case, just to keep yourself on the safe side plan for what might happen IN CASE thing wont happen like you thought and you will be searched and arrested, cause this is one deep shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope you will never have to know the truth.

    You have rights. They can't pull anyone off the street and grill them for 8 hours.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The point is, the police don't have the upper hand until you sign your name and take possession. Who gives a fuck if the cops think your getting drugs sent to your house? We both know I ordered the drugs, but they can't prove it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The cops don't have enough budget to stake out your house for a gram of meth or 2 grams of MDMA. This is something many people forget. Cops could just as easily stake out your mailbox and grab your ass the second you grab the package. Think of the man hours this cost! Most departments are operating on a very small budget as it is, they can't afford to state Rufus and Tommy outside some college kids apartment for 12+ hours waiting for him to pick up a ounch of weed. They have to work too hard for that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    CD's are like shooting fish in a barrel. Not enough arrests this week? Lets do a few CD's to bring up the stats.

    Just prepare yourself for any case, even the worse - not to be caught by surprise, cause they love that. And never believe you are immune for some reason, no matter how much logical it seems to you, for your own safety.

    From my experience, it's not good to not be home for a delivered package.  They send it back to the post office, and leave you that little note that they'll come again in a few days.  This really raises paranoia.  Found out you can chase the package.  Which we did.  All the way to the P.O.  And even then, didn't really have to show ID, I just showed the slip and said, "shit man i just missed it and it's important" they obliged w/out question.  Walked out as if everything were legit, grateful and blessing the P.O. staff.  When i got home i opened up a box w/ 2oz. of delicouse MDMA ;p CD though, practice installing a proxy at residential addy's, and be ready to get a good lawyer, usually that will keep you away from being incarcerated.  If that happens though move if you wish to continue your ventures as you will always be watched 'cause they're going to hate you when you just get a slap on the wrist for 30+ felony possessions and what not, with no leads or traces to bust you again lol

    If I wasn't expecting a package requiring a signature, I would ignore any note asking me to come sign for a package.

    When you sign, you are agreeing to take the package and likely almost assured of a unchallengeable search warrants.

    My bad i was so high that apparently th OP wasnt clear :)

    What i ment to say is:  Thats it was such fun to recieve and sign an unexpected letter at the time when i had no drugs ordered or expected in the mail ---  hence, nothing to fear of, no reason to refuse, no reason not to sign etc...  And if it has happend a few days earlier i would shit my pants cause at that time I did have drugs in the mail.

    How these little things makes such a diffrence, before i knew SR, the tought of not signing some letter would never even crossed my mind. Think about that :)
