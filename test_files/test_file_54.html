    This more or less just a thread to gather some data and maybe find a reasonable conclusion. I've recently lost two packages from the Netherlands to the US with no love letter or any indication that customs has even touched the packages. I've never had an issue before and I'm really not worried. Has anyone else had recent seizures or lost packages coming out of the Netherlands headed for the States? Granted, Sandy has slowed mail down a bit, one of the orders should have been here way before the storm hit. I'm going to have some test mail sent to try and help source down the issue, but would love some input.

    I ordered Oct 4th, split into 2 packages... It is now Nov 10th, I haven't received anything. My 1st time ordering from NL. Anything to expect or should I patiently wait as it may arrive?

    Been waiting on a package from the NL, was marked in transit October 13th, it's now Nov. 10th so 28 days and nothing received so far. Prior to this, I had received 3 packages from the NL (from 3 different vendors) in 4 days, 4 days and 8 days.

    Sandy definitely fucked international shipping. However, I've never had a pack not show from NL. From the research and reading I've done on the forum, I think that packs that don't show from NL aren't even being sent. Aussies get scammed by vendors like this A LOT.

    I should say I'm not really worried about scamming since I've had multiple transactions with the same vendor, with no prior issues even after some events that hurt business on his end, we still continued successful business. It is nice to see that I'm not the only who has had packages from the Netherlands go missing over the past month especially with people we have had a nice record with vendors before. Hopefully when SR comes back up, I can make another order with a different vendor and it will show. If not, maybe its time to stick with domestic vendors for a while.

    Ive never had a tracked order from NL not make it...if your order isnt tracked, it can be anybody's guess.Â  Personally I wouldnt make an international order that wasnt tracked, and honestly I dont make domestic orders that dont at least have delivery confirmation...its really worth the few extra dollars, because the buyer and the seller are protected againt fraud.

    I love all of the kids and burnouts with their dumb scare tactics. Most of the people on here amuse me and keep shit interesting. I always stay in escrow and I will come to a suitable resolution with my vendor. This was more or less a way to gauge if there was a crack down on packages. Since the start of this thread I did happen to receive one order, but I've come to terms with the one that I was most hoping for isn't making it here any time soon.

    yes ..tracking is costly...

    <br/>
    tracking is a very good way from holland...only the best vendors will do that.....( or the most stupid ones )

      You will have to come up with better tactics than "beware of dog" if your going to attempt scaremongering.

    Stop trying to scare people, the only thing scary about what you say is your terrible English. Trying to ruin a constructive thread with two-bit non-sense from a foreigner isn't helping the Road. People like you make these forums entertaining at times, but most of the time you are just a drag pulling people away from legitimate answers and conclusions. Have a nice day and go fuck yourself.

    Don't wanna get too specific but I am aware of someone who has been in prison for many years now because of a package that was sent to him from NL.Â  There was no love letter, the package just never arrived.Â  Then they watched him for like 2 years before they got him.Â  Why order international if you are in the US?Â  There are plenty of domestic vendors, and US Customs is no joke.

    I call bullshit.

    He must of been involved in other dealings than just having a package intercepted. Being watched for 2-3 years is also a pretty bold claim.

    Of course he was involved in other dealings.Â  It wasn't the package they busted him for, but that is what put them onto him and then they kept their eye on him until they had enough to get him.Â  That is how it works.Â  Just because they don't bust you the first time you screw up doesn't mean they aren't getting closer.Â  Once they start looking at you, you had better not be doing anything wrong.Â  If you are just buying for personal use, then maybe you'll be ok, but then again you'll start losing more packages, and have to change addresses, and they will watch you closer.Â  If you are doing like many do, which is buy in bulk from NL where it is cheap and then resell, you've got a good chance of getting caught up eventually.Â  The thing is, they are after bigger busts than just personal use.Â  If that is all they have on you they may wait and watch until they have something bigger.Â  On you.Â  Or whoever you deal with.Â  It just seems stupid to take that risk if there are so many domestic vendors to choose from.Â  The volume of domestic mail makes you so much smaller of a needle in a way bigger field of haystacks.

    One vendor that comes to mind who has awesome shipping from the NL is aakoven. Every single order was expertly packaged and arrived within 3-4 days of being marked in transit. One thing i can complain about is his prices, i wish they were lower but then again that's just me being greedy :P Some of his reviews say that they never received their package(s) but i've never had a problem.

    dunno whether holland is such a big risk...all mayor vendors and smuglars ship from belgium or germany...open borders anyway.........so the busts from Holland must be minimal....

    ps.. AAkoven is still a busy guy and a still damm fast shipper...look in his ratings...i did...because he is a hard worker...and has been waiting for his shit...years ago from others....keeping it up... day in day out.....far more than 1 year....still..he was the first guy to bring MDMA to the road....an old fox.. he is....
