    it really depends on the mailman/woman.  They will try your door first and then leave it in your mailbox or at the door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you should definitely not have to sign!  as long the vendor signed the section of the label that "waives signature upon delivery" you will not have to sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Months ago I had a few orders expressed and what do you know my doorbell rings at home around 10:30 AM.  Thats odd I thought....I figured express just came with my other mail.  LOL, the fucking mailman hand delivers me three express envelopes.  as i took 1 he would check the next for the waived signature...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    all the while Im thinking...
    <br/>
    heres the coke....
    <br/>
    yup, heres the gear
    <br/>
    and oh yeah thanks thats the bud!

    You will NOT have to sign for lettermail shipped express from Canada to the USA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Further, many get confused cuz the name of Canada's 'basic' first trackable method to the US is called Xpresspost, and that's just the name of the mailer/service .... it's not actually express delivery.  So are you sure the vendor's shipping didn't say US -&gt; Xpresspost or Expresspost (in one word)?  Cuz that's a brand, not a service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh and too add, it cost extra for the canadian shipper to buy signature at request, so unless your vendor is the dopiest character around, he didn't explicitly go and spend extra money to make sure your package needs to be signed for.

    Avoid ordering with a "signature required". Without a signature required it is easy to identify a controlled delivery. In a routine controlled delivery the undercover fed will require you to sign for the package containing drugs in order to validate their conditional warrant to raid the address it is being delivered to.
