    I like to think I am.

    I've never spoken with him, but he's made a few mistakes in the past (dropping a letter in my mailbox that needed to be signed) and I've gone out of my way to make sure he got his signature so he didn't get in trouble. Say good morning to him when we run into each other, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like to think it helps in case he had a second thought about a delivery.

    Very true -- but why not have the mailman make the controlled delivery? Just have the police nearby recording the whole thing so it holds up in court.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No idea how controlled deliveries work, and hope I never find out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You just have to be good at reading people. The postman doesn't make controlled deliveries every day and will be nervous; look for the signs.

    I wrote this rambling thread awhile back:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28101.msg307881#msg307881
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was expecting a letter today, so I spent the majority of this afternoon riding around on my bike, casually stalking the mailmen. I wasted a few hours, and probably smell like balls, but I got some possibly valuable information and exercise. I now have a good idea of who the postmen are, and their routes and routines; where they park the trucks, and go out walking for deliveries from there, how far down the route my address is, normal delivery times, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was also looking for evidence of surveillance, unusually parked cars, police presence in the neighborhood, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course the letter didn't arrive today, which is disappointing. But I like to think that I got a bit of valuable information. I've been noting the delivery times on past packages, and so far the only thing out of the ordinary would be International Express shipping, which comes earlier in the day than most, via USPS minivan, and requires a signature. To my knowledge, priority mail does not require a signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was also trying to be outside on the patio relaxing when the mail arrived, so I can see the mailman approaching and accept the parcel outside, and if it required a signature feign surprise, and state that said person wasn't home, and deny the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what do you guys think? Am I overly paranoid? I believe knowledge is power, and it would be pretty hard to perform a controlled delivery if I know the routes and positions of where the mail trucks are supposed to be at, and I'm outside when the mailman arrives. From what I've established, a police officer will disguise himself as the postman, and solicit a signature for your package, with surveillance watching the premises. I don't believe an undercover officer would go through an hour of normal deliveries and stick to the routine before doing a controlled delivery. My feeling is they would park a postal truck very near the home, earlier in the day, substitute the mailman for an officer, and would have surveillance on the street. If I know what to expect, there is no way that they can surprise me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've also been watching a lot of Burn Notice lately, so that probably doesn't help.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what do you guys think, is it a bad idea to take a casual bike ride around the neighborhood a few hours or so before expecting a delivery, and casually search for the mail truck, to see who is driving it, walking the routes, and estimate how far down the route they are? How about quick sweeps for surveillance, i.e, big dark SUV's, Crown Victoria's, unusual cars parked on the street, etc. Getting to know your neighborhood seems wise, so you can see if anything is out of place that day. How about sitting outside reading a magazine on your patio while waiting for the postman to arrive?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also accept the possibility that I'm completely insane and paranoid. But from what I've read about controlled deliveries, it seems like they be avoided with a bit of information about your surroundings, and scanning the area for unusual activity and being extra cautious a few hours before the mail is expected to arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone here ever had to sign for a SR parcel via USPS? Have you stalked your mail carrier? Are you friendly toward him, or consider him to be the enemy, and to be avoided at all costs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I now know that I am at the end of the route, and have noted my mail usually gets delivered at a certain time, and the mail trucks are usually a block or so down the street and the carrier walks the block from there. Any special attention or behavior will be easily noticed by myself. I plan on taking a short bike ride tomorrow as well, to scan the surrounding area a few hours before the expected delivery. It's unfathomably hot outside, so anyone parked in a vehicle is a dead giveaway, and I can now estimate when the mailman will arrive at my address based on his truck location in the neighborhood.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any input is appreciated. I'm just curious as if anyone has performed surveillance on a postman or their neighborhood before.

    Could you easily link me to a few? Interested in learning about this topic, especially how America does it. (Continental Europe here)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think, that if it's not happening now, it will happen. American police have been pushing their power and limits forward for awhile. Took a big leap forward after 911. Of course wire tapping etc had always happened illegally and secretly, but then it got put into law with your patriot act.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Push the limits slowly, have it tried in court and the judge interpret it as legal, then repeat. Slow expansion of power that government bureaucracies are know for. "Always test the limit of the mandate"
