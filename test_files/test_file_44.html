    So, I have a buddy out west who has access to pounds of medical herb- blah blah blah.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was shipped out earlier this week and was supposed to arrive 2 days ago. Its coming priority mail and the DCN says it was dispatched to sorting facility and then it departed the sorting facility. No other information than that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My buddy's packaging is great, thats nothing to worry about. He sent another package out the same day and it reached the east coast on time, 2 days ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is anybody else experiencing slowness right now? Theres no holiday to slow down the mail or anything, I receive and ship stuff all the time and I don't remember the last time priority has taken this long...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My buddy did mention that there were some storms and some flights in between us were being grounded because of tornado winds and shit?? Would this cause a 2-3 day delay???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I worry? Or should I wait another day until monday until I start shitting my pants...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its a fucking pound for god's sake, really hope I dont lose this shipment  :-\

    I am too waiting for a package which was apparently sent 9 days ago, domestically. Domestic normally takes 1-2 days so I highly doubt that my package was ever sent  :-\  I wait some more days...
