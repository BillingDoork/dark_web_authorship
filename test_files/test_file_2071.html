    so i ordered a half g of blow from a new vendor who seems to have pretty good reviews so far (won't name names for now).  it's been over 2weeks and nothing arrived.  is it possible LE intercepted?  is it dangerous to re-ship to same address?  vendor insists it's still "on it's way" but i'm not really buying it.  i think he thinks i'm a scammer, but i'm really just an honest dude that wants to get a bit lifted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any advice much appreciated.

    Was it sent Priority with DCN?  If so, the seller by now is obligated to provide you with that number so you can check to see if there is any scan activity.   Quite honestly, if that seller shipped that order there is no way for him/her to know any more about that pkg than you do(which is nothing)  Your suspicions are not unfounded since it should have arrived by now no matter how it was sent.   There are several factors that might explain why it hasn't arrived but for now all you can do is eliminate some of them and narrow it down.  I don't think a legitimate seller would be so cavalier and quick to dismiss your concerns.  Find out if there is a Delivery Confirmation number.  If yes..check it.  If not...ask the person how they know it is "on the way".

    some possible reasons your mail hasn't arrived yet..
    <br/>
    missent
    <br/>
    misdelivered
    <br/>
    seized
    <br/>
    incorrectly addressed
    <br/>
    returned to sender
    <br/>
    stolen
    <br/>
    just plain lost somewhere in the system
    <br/>
    or...
    <br/>
    maybe it was never even sent

    Don't sweat it!  But hey one can never be too paranoid in this business. Just make sure you do not have any kind of records, passwords, links to the site, saved to disc/paper. You could always just deny... deny... Innocent until proven guilty.  8)  So consent to nothing, and sign nothing.
