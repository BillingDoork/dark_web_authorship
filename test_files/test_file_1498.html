    Hi guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've never bought more than 3 grams of coke at one time, I'm thinking about making a bigger purchase to get a better deal but I'm worried about the weight of say 7 to 10g arousing suspicion. The post would be Belgium to the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone have any experience with this?
    <br/>
    Cheers
    <br/>

    The only difference between 3g and 7g/14g is if you get caught, you may face a harsher penalty based on the amount. None of these will arouse more suspicion than another by look or feel alone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All are fine for a standard sized envelope.

    Hi moet, have you considered ordering UK to UK, you can bet 99.9% sure it will arrive. Just a suggestion,

    there is virtually any difference between a package containing 3g and one containing 7g. The whole order fully packaged weighs about 6-9 oz, which is well under the 13oz limit for shipping priority, and a few grams difference wont make much of a difference. Once you get up to 14g, a bulge can be felt if youre looking for it. Ounces and up will most likely have to be shipped in a larger package.
