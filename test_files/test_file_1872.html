    If you get a note saying they found something, does that increase heat on your incoming mail?

    guess it depends, and may be different in your country
    <br/>

    but just to add- I had few grams of weed sent in an envelope to my home address (no stealth packaging, sent from NL) last year that got stopped.  didnt hear anything before after 2 months after the letter was expected, the cops called me in for interrogation. just denied any connection to it acting stupid and case dismissed.
    <br/>
    have had numerous new orders with all kindsa drugs to the same address since then (kinda stupid i know..:/), never a problem (yet?) =P.. so atleast that addr didnt get flagged for that.  maybe it woulda been different if I got charged for the weed and case didnt get dismissed though..

    Apparently it doesn't, at least according to personal experiences that I've read here on the forums. Unless of course you're doing bulk then I don't see it being a problem because you're not a high valued target, but this is all pure speculation, if you're paranoid like me you'll change the address next time you order.

    Care to expand on your reasoning?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All information I've read (this is in regards to US and Canada) points to the fact that there is no system to enter LLs into a database for further cross-checking. So no, getting a love-letter doesn't mean your mail will be under closer scrutiny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about the scale of things and how many love letters are issued every day. Do you really think it's feasible to watch every single address? And how would that be done, anyway? A giant paper list at the post office that employees cross-check against every single letter? You could argue that it's done electronically, but despite what people think there's no "database" of mail-in-transit. A postal employee can't just punch in your address and see what letters and packages are coming to you because it simply doesn't work that way. (Note this applies to USPS/Canada Post only, FedEx and UPS have much more information available because they scan every item instead of just sorting it).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Letters and parcels aren't entered into a system, it's not like it comes from the post-box to the sorting facility where a guy enters the full address of every single letter into a database. If you're mailing something through gov't post it just gets sorted by region, city, then postal code and then it gets delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As you can see there's nowhere in this chain of custody that it would be feasible to cross check every letter against a list of people who have LLs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, if they do seize something coming to you and they decide to sic LEO on you and start an investigation you'll never know about it until you get a controlled delivery. If you're actually under investigation nobody's going to bother sending you a letter saying "O HAI, WE KNOW UR BUYING ILLEGAL DRUGZ LOLL".

    I have no evidence to back this up, just speaking from my own personal logic/paranoia. But surely they would keep track of LLs sent to particular people somewhere, I'm guessing more in an LE database rather than the postal service. If one address got enough of them that may set of some kind of alert. Of course if this it true it would mean the address becomes an issue after multiple letters, not a just a single one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, just a thought, and as I said, not backed up by any real evidence.

    Nobody seems to know, which leads me to believe the answer is no, it does not put you "under surveillance".  But there are so many variables to consider in a case like this.  How large is your community?  Are you known to the mail staff?  Are you known as a criminal?  Or  do you live in a large city with so many residents and so few LE/Postal inspectors relative to the population that "flagging" and "watching" every address that they seize a package from is an impossibility?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How much effort is being put into terrorism right now as opposed to drugs in the mail?  How many of LE's resources are going to attempt to intercept terror money and communications or protect intellectual property?  How much effort is your country putting into tax cheats?  People like postal inspectors and federal officers/agents have a lot on their plate these days.   We are here on SR so our focus is moving contraband like drugs, but there are many issues just as important to LE and they also require money and manpower.  Fraud never stops.  Child pornography never stops.  Human trafficking never stops.  When you consider that almost all sales on SR are end users ordering to catch a buzz or get their dick nice and hard or lose a few pounds- it looks pretty tame compared to the torture/abuse of kids.  Or terrorists funding the next major bombing.
