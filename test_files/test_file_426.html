    Do all tracked packages from Germany and Netherlands require a signature upon arrival in the US?

    If it's sent under Registered Mail then one has to be present and/or sign for a package upon arrival. I received a tracked package from Germany sent under registered mail that required I be present at the time of delivery. However, they did not require a signature. I just had to be there. Others had different experiences where they did have to sign for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way...signing for a package does not necessarily mean you know what's inside of it. There are many threads out there with debates about this. I for one would sign for any package whether I knew it was mine or not just out of reflex.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How many times have you looked at a mailman who was handing you a package and said "who's this from?"..."I didn't order that"..."That's not mine"...Etc. Etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it doesn't seem fishy then Just sign it...

    IME every package from EU required a signature.  Although I had to pick them up at the post so I'm not sure if thats the reason.  Signatures don't bother me.  There's plenty of deniability when dealing with signing for packages...
