    Hey Vendor´s and shipping-community  ;) ,
    <br/>
    today i want to ask some beginner questions about packaging and shipping because i start in the near future as a vendor! :-) but atm i don´t know what to sell, that needs some time!
    <br/>
    I wish on following questions an answer, please be tolerant, i do this first time  :) :
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. How did you remove my fingerprints, from all that stuff for packaging (baggies, air-drops-foil, meta-foil, Paper, Letter, Tixo,......), i have often touched that and i know it is full of fingerprints!, any good idea how i clean that? (I have Window-Cleaner, 2x Bath/&amp;Shower-Cleaner,  Cillit-Bang and Tanchlor, are any from these, nice for cleaning?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. How i send my drug-package away?, did i go into the Post-Office and show myself in a camera ? Or how i send letters anonymously away? You guys are pro´s and know how to do it, please tell me that! :-) , maybe postmarks are one way but where i get them anonymously?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. From where did i get the anonymously packaging-equipment? From Silk Road ?, when yes from which category?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope you buyers and vendors can help a new Vendor! (atm im not a vendor, but in few weeks), so i get my info´s for all as fast as i can!  :D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope you all understanding it well!,
    <br/>
    greetings,
    <br/>
    Jump3r  ;)

    If you're a beginner wait a few months before becoming a seller, you want to see what other sellers are using as packages.. For fingerprints it's important you wear gloves when you touch to anything you are going to ship, some thing are hard to manipulate with gloves but you can use small pliers to manipulate them. You can get packaging supply from all office oriented shops and you doesn't need to go to the post office at all to send a package, just drop it in a nearby mail drop point (not the one that are the closest to your house) you have to weight the packages yourself with a scale but this is damn easy. A good thing is to vac seal everything too, depending on the drug you are wanting to ship, some sellers double or triple vac seal the stuff they ship to evade sniffing dogs or electronic sniffers.
