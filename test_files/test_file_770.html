    Do all international shipments to the US that have DCN require a signature upon arrival? I have a package from a NL vendor that require a signature. What should I do?

    you should track it everyday, and if it gets held up, then when it arrives don't sign for it.Â  i.e. you should see inbound into customs, if it clears customs your cool, this usually takes between 2-6 hours and you will have an update saying outbound out of customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now onto the local law level.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    next your package will be updated upon arrival to the nearest port city near you, or your city. once the package is close to you geographically, if its not delivered in two days, don't sign for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as an extra precaution, have a friend over to sign for it, and leave the package on the table unopened.
    <br/>
    if they do a controlled delivery and raid the house, just say oh my friend signed for it he didn't know that john doe doesn't live here he thought he must have been a roomate or something, theres the package unopened i have no idea who its for or whats in it, i was going to return it.

    Disregard what greenmonster said ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A DCN is not a tracking number ... therefore you will likely not see inbound/outbound scans or many scans at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As well ... even if it was 2-6 hours is NOT a suitable timeframe to judge customs lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An international item will require signature if it was requested by the sender or is unable to fit in the mailbox/PO box
