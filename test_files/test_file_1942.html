    Hey bro,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had same sit. - i fucking peaked as it would flag my beautiful drop spot.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    took a while to chill and gain perspective.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    most important - just clean house---------------- drugs, weapons, paraphernalia. etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    clean any previous shipping package material.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do not take ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    present yourself well, smile, be polite - no nerves! (well try hehe)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just cruise up with card, no ID - if they ask/press you say "fuck sorry i just walked up - i live close i can go and grab it"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    either they'll just hand over and tell you not to worry - or ask you to get your ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    at this stage you can decide whether you go back or not - i.e. NOT.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    pick it up very late - just before they close.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck!

    Same thing happened to me recently.  If there is no delay, you should be fine (they need to go through the process of getting warrants, etc if they are going to attempt a controlled delivery).  And if they ask for an ID just tell them you lost it and ask if they will deliver it again or just leave it in a safe spot.  That's what I did and they gave me another "we missed you" card the next day, which was enough to get the package at the PO.  Most importantly, make sure you know your mailman because if it's not him/her attempting to deliver it, your f-u-c-k fucked (unless you deny delivery).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    being friendly and putting a smile on your face goes a long way...because I'm pretty sure the blond at the PO wasn't supposed to give me it without proper ID, but I got it.

    you can, but if you at the PO you're going to be on camera.  Just chill out, if it isn't late they probably haven't had time to get warrants and create a plan to get you.
