    Hello community.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am not sure as to what i am to do now. usps guarantees 2-5 days for shipping, yet it has been more and i have not recieved the package. if i do not receive it in a couple days how can i get a full refund? this is unfair completely, especially so because not only have i paid alot of money, but other people have stated they got their package (same item) in two days, it has been seven for me and no package so far.

    You say 2-5 days and more. How much more have you waited? Be patient as USPS can be unpredictable. I'm pretty sure that's a "soft" guarantee.

    Where is it coming from?  Is it a domestic shipment or international?

    Be patient and try to cover all the possibilities before you jump to any conclusions.

    Do you see if the vendor has been on since you have sent the messages?  In your 'sent' folder, does it show the message as being read yet or not?  Does the vendor have a good reputation?  Is your transaction still in escrow?  Did you make sure to get your address correct when you encrypted it?
    <br/>
    One time a order that was supposed to take 2 days took closer to 11 to get to me, and it was the post office's fault, the address was correct but they sent it to a wrong sorting facility somewhere along the way.  So, a lot of different things can happen to delay a package.  In my experience It's VERY rare that it is the fault of USPS, but it does it happen.

    Login to SR and look at the top of the page. There is a link that says 'Account'. Click it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That takes you to a new page. On the right hand side of the page it says 'Account history'. Click it. Within that page is your transaction history. Find the transaction you made with that vendor. Send those transaction details to the vendor.

    For some reason, where I live, shit takes long to arrive. It's been 9 days so far for a domestic and they said it should ship in 2-3. Really weird. I'm starting to get paranoid that I didn't write the right address in the order box.
    <br/>
    Seller just said mail moves at it's own pace, which is true. But also said they don't track, which is weird since they are a top seller.

    Yes, i went to my sent and clicked "read" to read the messages i sent, and it shows the messages i sent and beside the ones he has not respond to it says "read" and then "delete under it, i sent another message and it says unread so he has obviously been reading my messages and not responding. This is sketching me out. i believe it is in the escrow system, i bought through the website, added it to my cart. the only thing different is he says he saved me another ounce of the mushroom capsules he said so he made me a whole other page of the item, i suppose so other people could not get to it because he said he was "saving" the item for me. He has a fantastic reputation, 100% top 22% of vendors, with 113 transactions. all feedback looks amazing, and MOST people are saying it has taken their orders only two days to get to the east coast, and i live on the east coast, and it has been almost ten days. I told him tomorrow would be the last day that i will wait (tenth day) and if it is not here i will take action in getting a refund/reporting him, whatever i have to do to get my bitcoins back. The vendor is blueveil, and it is really sketching me out knowing he has read my messages and not replied, he also just put up a new item when he had none so that shows he has been on since. What should i do??

    Posting this on the forums after only 2 days past the expected delivery date is only going to piss off the vendor and make it less likely that you will get it resolved.
    <br/>
    Even on ebay my packages are usually late and this isn't ebay so I would quit complaining.
    <br/>
    I've had domestic orders take up to 8 days longer than expected and I've never wasted a vendors time by nagging them about my order.
    <br/>
    In fact if you read most vendors pages they usually say "DO NOT message me about an order if its been less than 30 days"
    <br/>
    I don't know about Blueveil in particular but you should really be patient.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And how do you know that the order was actually shipped 7 days ago?
    <br/>
    Most vendors mark the item "in transit" up to 24 hours before it is actually shipped so its probably on it's way to you right now.

    2 days is late is a little soon to panic. Do you know for a fact what day it was shipped?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It depends on a lot of factors. For domestic priority shipping shouldn't take too long to ship. It depends on where you and the shipper live. Also believe it or not on the size or shape of the box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would not wait 30 days. There is no way a domestic priority mail will take 30 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you using an address you control? Is the name you used to a real address? If you used a fake name or a bad address there are all kinds of things that can go wrong. Non of which are the vendors fault.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you used a real name to a real address and isn't in a large or weird  shape than most places will be received in 3 days from the shipping date. There are a few states where shipping can take 5 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since you stayed in escrow and said you are dealing with a vendor with good feedback you probably don't have to worry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have to factor in the weekend as well. There are some legit reasons it might take a little longer. Remember this isn't just any package. The shipper has to have time to take care with packing as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do get in touch with the vendor don't assume anything yet. It is a little soon to be in panic mode. Just ask if he could please let you know when he/she shipped so you know when to look out for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helped you.

    If you finalized early and indeed get scammed for $80 (that's if you did get scammed...I not saying that but please remember USPS service has been slow all January)
    <br/>

    Consider yourself lucky should lose just $80 as their any many, many others that have got scammed for a significant amount more.

    I think,  DO NOT FINALIZE EARLY.  needs to be mentioned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Escrow is for the protection of both the vendor and the customer.       Also,   wait a week, if it hasn't came, then I would contact the vendor.     If he is reputable, u should be able to get it figured out.

    So yes never FE. Either ivorys stealth is pathetic, or it wasnt even sent.

    So thats it, your not protected and vendor doesnt refund, so its a loss and a hard lesson learnt.  ;)

    Don't feel so bad. I think 90% or more of us that have been on SR for an extended period of time have learned that lesson. Things are a lot better now, but back in the day the shit was rampant. I personally lost $350 to hybridmike. He was one of the top coke vendors and when SR had it's first customer appreciation sale he lined up a huge FE scam. Nothing like tony76, but he still got away with $10k+. Just like tony76 when he did it he had built up trust beforehand by completing hundreds of successful deals. Then once he had everybody on board he flipped. It was an expensive education for me.
