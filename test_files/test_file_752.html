    I'm waiting on a 1.5LB pack that was sent express mail before noon wednesday.  I just checked the tracking and it still says dispatched to sort facility even though guaranteed delivery was 12pm 2/14.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm concerned to say the least. It was a domestic transaction.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anybody know what the tracking would say if it was seized?

    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=122293.0
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyways.. yeah i would be very cautious when picking it up .. is it getting delivered to your house?
    <br/>
    if so clean it make sure nothing is there.. and have some money for a lawyer..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i have herd of express mail getting lost for a couple days.. but its very very rare..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and the fact ur pack is that heavy is also a red flag.. wtf is it weed? is it from a flagged State?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    either way i would ditch that shit not worth it to me.. but hey .. do what u gotta do man.. i would suggest you
    <br/>
    not fuck with that package..

    What do you mean the package wasnt there? its not being delivered to an abandoned structure is it i hope. Have you contacted the vendor and asked them if it was sent priority instead of express?

    Tracking still saying the same thing.  No doubt in my mind it got seized, express doesn't take a week.  I'm not worried though my funds were in escrow.

    its almost a sure thing if tracking quits updating like that on an express pack its gone... if the last scan was at the sorting place it may have been pulled off the line because it was something that stood out with the package. dont bother calling the po with the tracking number all youll get is the run around. theyll say that maybe it got lost but you know the truth, dont file for the insurance or collect a refund for it not making it on time, and dont use that address for a while on dirty packs. sometimes they just dont make it coulda been a number of reasons, lets say if it was weed n the person who drops off the box maybe had contaminated surfaces (car door handles, house door handles from like smoking a joint and going outside or back inside, or just packed in a non-sterile environment) and touched the box again and contaminated it. sorry for your luck, if it magically shows up dont sign for it, and ignore the mail man if the knock, if they leave it on the porch (its not gonna happen) be cautious of taking it inside. dont panic tooo much people lose way more everyday and never hear anything from it 1.5 pounds is pretty small anyway so just wash your hands of the situation and keep it moving forward. some lessons (like how to deal with a lost order) are just more expensive than others but atleast ur not in trouble, if they were gonna do a CD it wouldsa happened already before you even knew the box was late.

    I admit, i work at the sorting facility where this package was processed through and i spotted it because of your post. It was just running a little late because everything is a little slow here at usps this month. yours wasnt hard to find. ( the only 1.5 plus lb express package) mmmm,is that purple kush? im just messing with you dude. next time though instead of posting a problem you should hit the vendor up and see if they will track it for you. theres probably not too many express packages that size that are regularly shipped from the same area to your address so be careful about what you post. probably ask somebody to delete the thread altogether?

    so OP.. you ordered 1.5 lbs of weed.. and request it to be next-dayed from a vendor who doesn't even use PGP? seems like you want to get caught.

    the reckless SR users can take the fall so the rest (studious and careful people) can get away with getting drugs shipped to them.
