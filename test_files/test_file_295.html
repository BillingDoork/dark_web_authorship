    I doubt it.  If it's priority i would plan on 4 days.  Could be 3 or 5, but plan on 4.  If it's express it's sometimes 2 and sometimes 3.  Coast to coast adds at least 1 day.

    You could ask your vendor for the tracking number. I don't know anyone who sells online who doesn't pay the extra fee for one.

    Read the vendors profile, they usually put guidelines for when to contact, etc.  Definitely give it an extra day, I'm on day 3 myself.. its really hard to be patient.. I know, but at least wait until day 5 priority before thinking there might be an issue.

    What country are you in?

    92%+ of Priority Mail [in the US] is delivered within 2 business days. The rest in 3 (if you live in the sticks). That said, shit does happen and RARELY a package will take longer.

    Sometimes priority will take up to 5 days I have noticed.  Most of the time it has only been 2-3 days for me.

    See, I always provide tracking. I think it's just 'professional' to do so and there's really no harm in it. Sure, it's possible someone could figure out that you ordered something and find the DCN, but it's really a moot point as they have to figure your exact location also.
