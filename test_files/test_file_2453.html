    I have a question here---
    <br/>
    Should I ship a magic mushroom spore syringe for cultivating MM's to my HOUSE or my friends APARTMENT (He agreed to it)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ask because they should just leave the box at my door, but since he lives in an apartment the mail man delivers mail personally, which can hurt if it is a controlled delivery. Thoughts?

    I'm new to the SR side of these things. However, I would be very surprised if you got a CD for spores.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know some people that receive active species spore prints through the mail fairly often. They will be hard pressed to tell the difference between legal and controlled spore types.

    well the package looked good everytime(like a sr package) came in small priority box no vac seal needed and syringes cannot be seen if opened and a hell of a lot cheaper than vendors on the road selling spores but do whatever you like just remember no risk=no reward

    Long story short - do what you have to do to feel comfortable. But just keep in mind that literally thousands of people on the Road are getting illicit substances shipped to their house/apartment. Read through a vendor's feedback and see if there is mention of solid packaging or whatever... do a little research and you'll be fine either way.
