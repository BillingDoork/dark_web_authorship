    So, I've read a lot of the threads on these MBBs but I can't seem to find any info on how to do it anonymously.  I'm sure it's out there, but I've obviously missed it.  But... on the off chance that it isn't out there, will someone please explain how to do it in the US?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've ordered them before but I can't use them because of the stupid lot numbers on them.
    <br/>
    I can't use gift cards at checkout on sites unless the card is registered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do I need to buy a gift card, buy a burner phone, register under fake name and then have it deliverd to some drop address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Little help would be appreciated.  I just want to keep my customers safe.

    Where are my manners, thank you.

    However, I am a vendor and anonyminity is imortant.
    <br/>
    I'd have to supply some fake address and even then somehow get my hands on the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now let's say that the lot number on those packages is used as tracking.  LE buys from me, gets the lot number and now has a buyer account, and an address.  Sure, it may not be a good address but it may be a start.  I'm just trying to be safe here.

    Surely a vendor would have all these issues already ironed out.

    <br/>
    Go find yourself a dead drop, and if youre really paranoid, make another buyer account, and just purchase it to the dead drop, and go and pick it up.

    Don't order from your vendor account. Use a dummy account, then Pluto will know you're ordering because you are probably a vendor but what one of the fucking hundreds that use this place daily.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you can't trust Pluto (the founder of the MBB's on here), the guy who brought MBB's to use to make it safer for vendors and customers, then you shouldn't be here.

    LE are not after the small time here. If they are even actually doing anything about the site, they will be trying to shut it down completely, catch DPR and probably the biggest of the vendors.

    1. Buy Mylar bags instead - they don't have lot numbers and are just as good.
    <br/>
    2. Buy bigger MBBs and cut them in half, cutting out the lot number. Every size I've seen has been too big for me. Of course, there's a difference if you're shipping grams or ounces.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's no need to order them anonymously. PlutoPete's heat seal foil is vastly overpriced in my opinion but it won't have any lot numbers on it either.

    Here's my take on it: I have some MBB's that I use to ship out product. They have only one identifying number on them, some sort of batch number. A friend had gotten something legal (quasi) off of SR recently that was packaged in the same MBB's, and it had the same batch number on it. So maybe the only people buying MBB's are preppers and online drug dealers. Anyway, I'm not too worried. Or am I?

      Here's my take on it: I have some MBB's that I use to ship out product. They have only one identifying number on them, some sort of batch number. A friend had gotten something legal (quasi) off of SR recently that was packaged in the same MBB's, and it had the same batch number on it. So maybe the only people buying MBB's are preppers and online drug dealers. Anyway, I'm not too worried. Or am I?

    Something that might work?:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Get a business to stock them for retail sale. Have someone talk a business, possibly in a nearby - rather than your own - town, into selling them. Indoor horticulture supply outlets, headshops, glassblowers,... come to my mind. Choose a national chain and you might help many people with this issue. Could be a bad idea? Anyone see a problem?

    So those 3m Moisture Barrier Bags ( 7mil )

    Are the ones I have too.  They do have a lot number, and you can order them from ULINE.

    How many per lot?

    I have a company ordering them for me, a couple thousand.
    <br/>
    I'm using them for opening up a new market to the US ( MDMA ).

    If for some reason the MDMA market goes south, I'll be happy to sell them out here for cost ( 2.80 per bag plust S/H ).

    From the point of a customer yes, but we absolutely cannot allow vendors security to drop to that of customers or else they WILL get busted. Everybody agrees that LE is really after the vendors, what better way to identify all of them than to be the number one seller of bags that only vendors buy? I cannot stress enough that vendors should not buy shipping materials from other vendors on SR, it will quite definitely turn out to be the Achilles Heel of SR.

      Where are my manners, thank you.

      <br/>
      However, I am a vendor and anonyminity is imortant.
      <br/>
      I'd have to supply some fake address and even then somehow get my hands on the package.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Now let's say that the lot number on those packages is used as tracking.  LE buys from me, gets the lot number and now has a buyer account, and an address.  Sure, it may not be a good address but it may be a start.  I'm just trying to be safe here.

     Don't order from your vendor account. Use a dummy account, then Pluto will know you're ordering because you are probably a vendor but what one of the fucking hundreds that use this place daily.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you can't trust Pluto (the founder of the MBB's on here), the guy who brought MBB's to use to make it safer for vendors and customers, then you shouldn't be here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LE are not after the small time here. If they are even actually doing anything about the site, they will be trying to shut it down completely, catch DPR and probably the biggest of the vendors.

    Your logic is completely flawed. For all we know Pluto brought MBB here simply to get vendors using a product that is hard to come by locally, so they would all give him shipping addresses that can be put under surveillance in order to bust a ton of vendors. We cannot assume the best about people in this trade, or give anybody the benefit of the doubt. Simply ordering MBB, even if from a throw away buyer account, is enough to signify that you are a vendor and warrant further attention, such as surveillance of the pick up spot / box. Also, I love how when customers worry they are told LE is only after vendors, and when vendors worry then they are told LE is only after DPR. I am sure when DPR worries he will be told that LE is only after Mexican Cartel lords. This is not a good mentality to have, it is the mentality of those who get busted.

    This is a good idea. Being able to buy the bags at local stores with cash is the ideal solution, less than ideal is buying them from sites that have NOTHING to do with SR (as in, are not even suggested on SR), and having them sent (preferably a ton at once to not have to repeat the process) to a one time use fake ID box or random mail box not linked to the vendor. Nothing else is acceptable imo.

     1. Buy Mylar bags instead - they don't have lot numbers and are just as good.
     <br/>
     2. Buy bigger MBBs and cut them in half, cutting out the lot number. Every size I've seen has been too big for me. Of course, there's a difference if you're shipping grams or ounces.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There's no need to order them anonymously. PlutoPete's heat seal foil is vastly overpriced in my opinion but it won't have any lot numbers on it either.

    My foil actually works out pretty cheap compared to ready made bags, you can make 50 10cm x 10cm bags from 1m which costs about £9, that works out at 18p per bag :)
    <br/>
    Remember as well that my foil is 5ply while all the alternatives are 3ply, the extra strength may be overkill but if the best is available why use anything less :)

    In a post before you said you use your real return address on packages and understandably you probably do not take many other precautions because your products are legal. This makes it much easier to track you and if you did keep records, then you would have a huge list of vendors "addresses" if/when they came to pressurize you. Vendors selling any legal products (especially targeted at vendors) should always be approached with caution by the "normal illegal" vendors here. ;)

    I take lots of precautions with my business, it's my livelihood  :)
    <br/>
    Any vendor that kept addresses could be pressurized, but they could exert a lot less pressure on me than on an illicit vendor that they'd compromised, what would they pressurize me with?

    Any illegal vendor they can cut a deal, what kind of deal could they offer me?

     In a post before you said you use your real return address on packages and understandably you probably do not take many other precautions because your products are legal. This makes it much easier to track you and if you did keep records, then you would have a huge list of vendors "addresses" if/when they came to pressurize you.

    I believe sellers are required by SR policy to delete all address info once an order is shipped. It should not matter if the products were legal or illegal.

    I agree although it is impossible to monitor whether vendor do delete addresses.

    Yes, I think this might tempt more vendors. ;)

    I think it doesn't matter if someone selling legal or illegal things is selling these bags. The last thing we want is a centralized compromisable node that has the address of every single vendor using MBBs. That goes against security in a very strong way, it creates a single point of failure and no matter if vendors get things shipped to fake ID boxes or not getting product is always the most risky part of this business. For customers it is less risky because they only need to worry about interception for the most part, for vendors there is a concentrated effort to fuck them and having all the vendors ordering bags from a source or even sources on SR is just absolutely horrible for security and I have no doubt whatsoever that it will lead to arrests sometime down the line, regardless of the legitimacy of the person currently selling them. Decentralization is one of our biggest security assets, don't throw it away by linking yourselves to a single point of failure.
