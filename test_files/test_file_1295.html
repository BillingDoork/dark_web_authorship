    So my friend ordered a good amount (over 20g) of stuff from canada and used xpresspost to send it to the US. It shipped on Wednesday (2 days ago). Supposedly it came today but he wasn't home so the mailman left one of those stickers on his door saying how he needed a signature to release it or something and to pick up the package from the post office when it's available (starting tomorrow) like UPS does. Is it safe to go pick it up or are their going to be cops waiting for the package to get released to him? was this a failed CD? I mean I never heard of USPS no putting it in the mail. apparently it said "The envelope was too big for the mailbox" or something like that. Help?!? Should he go tomorrow to get it or not? Also the tracking says it never was "Delivered" and still in transit.

    express post from Canada to the US requires a signature hence the note. CD wouldn't leave a tag for you to come pick it up, they would just try to deliver the next day.

    Yes this is perfectly normal... go in tomorrow and get the package! they didn't put it in the box because it requires a signature buddy! Clearly you can't sign if they just drop it off but all is good... just cause you missed them doesn't mean they all of a sudden know what;s inside! Thousands of packages are missed for delivery every day and it just sits there waiting for you to come in and get it bro!

    express post pre paid envolopes(what most vendors in Canada use)come in two sizes.He probably used the bigger on and it indeed is too big for a mail box and needs a sig so you should be fine!

    If it's on time and there is no delays in time-frame from the sending of the mail to the time it was delivered, then just go in and pick it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2 days is normal from express from Canada to US, yes? It's when you all of a sudden get an express delivery on day 15 and a note left to go sign for it that I would be worried about any type of controlled delivery attempt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I say this because if there is no noticeable delays then you have to think to yourself that if the package was intercepted, an investigation would have to be started by the authorities and there would be a lot of red tape which would take (days) to organize and setup.

    You will be fine, go for it!
