    So I've been bumming around Europe, generally enjoying the faster shipping times from many SR vendors. I had one major hiccough recently though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just got into a new apartment, and obtained the mailing address from the landlady. From her wording, I read it as me being able to put my own name down for delivery (it's an apartment building with about 40 mailboxes at the bottom floor) and it would show up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Upon recent inspection of the e-mail however, I found that she had put HER name above the address (it was in french and I was a little blasted the first time I read it, so I guess it didn't register.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's the thing: I'm in Paris right now. The order I made shipped on Wednesday around 8:30 UTC from a vendor who's location is undeclared. One of his last feedbacks says 4 days to Germany (maybe you can guess who now). I'm afraid that the letter arrived on saturday morning and that the postman had no idea where to put it and just took it back with him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem is that I went to the local La Poste office to see if I could find the letter and they were not tolerant of my basically non-existant French and said they couldn't help me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I consider the letter lost? I wrote my name on the mail box, so if it's delivered today I should get it. I'm about to leave Europe, so it would be just peachy to get some of this particular substance in my hands before I go back to the boring, fat US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone have any suggestions, other than praying?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Incidentally, could anyone estimate how fast Ivory would ship to Paris? I sent me an email saying my order from him was dispatched yesterday. Wednesday is my last night here, so fingers crossed for that too.
