    Obviously i'm new here, and to be honest im not looking for bland answers. I would like to hear experiences, and as the subject saids opinions and advices. I'm just very cautious person, but hey not a bad thing right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a delivery being made using someone's address that i know, the content is bulk size. The person's address this is being sent to has been informed to check out who usually deliveries the mail, also for the next couple of days see if anything is stranger is happening in the area (anyone sitting in cars, walking around near his general place periodically etc.), and i don't know if this matter but if/when signed for not to open it at all for a few days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any flaws id like to be pointed out, is there any more i can do to avoid trouble, what are your ways of going about this?

    Find out from the shipper if it was sent with a signature required for delivery...hopefully not.  This way you simply refuse to sign for anything.  Be aware LE won't necessarily need you to sign for a package to charge you with receiving contraband via the mail.  Also, they are now using tracking bugs slipped inside the pkg so even if you open it 1 week later..it won't really matter.

    all you can really do my friend is pray, and try to not worry. if anything DOES happen they cannot prove you knew what was in the contents of the package, nor prove that you were expecting a package, so if your t h a t sketched out about the whole thing i'd suggest what you said from the getgo, let it sit for a few days, watch around the area for any different movement and such, basicly what everyone should do dealing in bulk.

    I haven't personally seen ANY cases of people getting done solely for purchases on SR. Protect your anonymity as best you can, sit back, and pray. Ideally, make smaller purchases in the event LE catches up with you.

    out of the 100-1000s of packages from sr that get sent out daily its unlikely that one person would get singled out unless the vendors packaging was obvious
