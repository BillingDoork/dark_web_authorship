    Straight to it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today I received an expected package from someone in the Netherlands. All was good except for quite a big tear on the side of the envelope which had been re-sealed by my country's post service. I have not opened it yet, and am going to let it sit for a day just in case it is a controlled delivery. I can still feel the product inside. I don't think such a big tear was due to post handling, the parcel was only moving for 6 days. I know for certain that the contents are very well packed as I have received from this vendor before. I find it a little strange that the product is still there. Do customs need a warrant to search a parcel?
    <br/>
    I have also written 'To be returned to sender' on the back of it in case le decide to show up. Has this happened to anyone and how can I better handle this situation?
    <br/>
    Also, if the dutch customs opened it, wouldn't they re-seal it as it was stitched back up in my country of residence.
    <br/>
    So many questions but any advice is appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sincerely,
    <br/>
    Dr. Paranoid.

    I would say it's probably the seller putting the wrong product in and having to tear it open, put the right product in then reseal it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing to worry about most likely. I've never known for a package to be opened and I've made quite a number of orders.

    Could be they opened to check and didnt find anything so resealed and sent it off. Or it could be accident.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Test your gear and see if it is real, and if it is real you are prolly ok and  Iwouldnt worry.

    Definitely not, the way it is packed it is impossible to do so.

    If you live by yourself, couldn't see any harm in just leaving it in your mailbox for the time being or something.  Just make sure you get it out before the next time your mailman comes to deliver mail so he doesn't take it with him lol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First thing I would think to do, if you haven't already, would be sending the vendor a message and confirm with him whether or not he had to reseal the package with the correct product which is possible but seems like an unlikely mistake to me too.

    It would also help to know what was (supposed to be) in the package, and what country you had it delivered to.

    Yes it was sealed with the official postal tape of my country, one that I do not feel too comfortable disclosing.
    <br/>
    The product is hash and I can still feel it in the parcel.

    Hmm.. I'd say hash is something very easy to indentify, so it would have been seized if it were a customs inspection, and you would probably receive a notice of this (depending on your country).

    It might simply be a tear that they figured would be fixable by applying some tape. These things are not as rare as you may think - envelopes sometimes get lodged between the end part of a conveyor belt and such and get torn. Most postal services will tape over the tear and send the letter (if its something that fits a mail slot) on its merry way. For most customers this is also the best solution since there is little or no delay, and usually post is about the content, not the envelope.

    I once received some electronics from China and the package was torn but nicely taped.   Inside there was a note from Canada Post explaining they had to tape it together because the package was torn open during shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No biggie.

    I've had similar things happen with non-SR orders too, sometimes including a apologee note that stated that the envelope was damaged somewhere in transit, and the decided that patching it up and sending in on was in their mind the best solution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This was a order of some electronic components from china (dont recall exactly what, i shop online a lot). The contents were, luckily, just fine.
