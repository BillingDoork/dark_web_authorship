    Hello :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would like to know if it's possible to send a international letter (Priority USPS) directly in a USPS mailbox ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or we absolutely need to go in the USPS post office ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance

    It is indeed possible to drop an priority envelope with an international destination into a blue box. You need to make sure you have the correct postage (duh... but can be difficult for international locations).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As long as your priority envelope is LESS THAN 16oz AND no more than 3/4" thick you do NOT need a customs form. That said... you really shouldn't put anything over 13oz in a blue box. Mileage varies and they may ship it anyway, but why risk it when their 'rule' is very clearly 13oz.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is VERY important to make sure your package has no bulges or is unbalanced if you don't fill a customs form out - this exception is for documents only... so if it's clear you're shipping something else, they will fuck with it if it doesn't have a customs form.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that helps. You can also find additional information here:

    The 16 oz rule was changed to 13 oz, that is now the max that can be put in a blue box domestic or int. Sure, you can do what you are suggesting but more than likely it will be sent back for a customs form if its a padded mailer or looks like it has more than a page or two in it. I got a couple back (legal stuff) and i would not chance a package without a customs form anymore. To use a customs form you must take it to the post office. It will not go forward with a hand written customs form and stamps. This i am sure of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bottom line, you must go in the post office and be photographed to do international packages. The only other option is a rehandler like a place that does ups and other services. They will do it for you for an extra charge and you avoid the cameras.

    Sigh.. .please don't post unless you know your facts. Go toÂ  the link I posted and all the information is there. The rule is 16oz FOR NOT REQUIRING CUSTOMERS DECLARATIONS. Yes, the rule for blue boxes is 13oz - AS I MENTIONED IN MY LAST POST.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Further, I mention the use of Priority Envelopes AND making it look like documents... did you even read my post?
