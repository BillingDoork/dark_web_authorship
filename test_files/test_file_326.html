    I have seen vendors offer bonus's for using PGP and others refusing to sell to anyone that doesn't use it.  I understand how PGP protects the buyer but how does it protect the seller?

    The only thing I can assume for people using pgp to send their address, with the vendor giving a bonus, is for the customers to use their brains.
    <br/>
    AND, if SR gets/is compromised, they vendors might get into more trouble as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was once asked not to use pgp, since that was better. I can only hope the guy meant that it was better because he couldn't decrypt it at the time.
    <br/>
    My current mission is to send messages to vendors that don't offer pgp. (and getting frickin donations to start vendoring myself but nobody donates,  :'( )
