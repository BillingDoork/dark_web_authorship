    I used a fake name on a sample some time ago and it never arrived. Luckily it was nothing illegal but probably suspicious. I used my last name and a similar first name. Now that I have orders on the way I'm rather worried... Any advice?

    Coulda been a family member like a cousin or something visiting and was getting mail at your house, which is why a different first name but same last name was used before. if you put john smith then sure, be paranoid.

    More likely that the sample was never shipped than something happened to it.  But yeah, fake names are suspicious.  Unless you can confirm with a DCN or absolutely trust the vendor, then they probably didn't send it.

    First thing you do is, “immediately” get out your label maker and put “this” fictitious” last name on your mailbox.  Keep it there for a while.
    <br/>
    Then train your postal carrier  and start sending some little packages and letters over a two week period, you'll invest about $10-$15 in postage and envelopes and now you've established a fake resident.  Now you can start ordering your things on Silk Road and have it sent to your address and send a letter to yourself maybe once a week or so just to serve as a reminder  for the mail carrier that mail will continue to arrive for your new fictitious roommate?   Paying the cost of a stamp and an envelope sending it your yourself once a week is a small price to pay as insurance to protect your $200 SilkRoad order.  After a month or so, then remove your fictitious label but continue to send yourself the reminder envelopes to your fictitious roommate.  Now you don't really need to worry about it any more.   It's a no brainer.

    My idea may not be perfect, but perhaps some of our other friends online here and chime in and further help to refine this approach?

    No offense, but there is no reason to go through all that trouble. They aren't going to give a shit what name you use unless it looks totally fake. If you are ordering to your house, you have more to worry about then simply using a fake name.

    Actually, some zip codes have extremely strict postal carriers and management, and they force each address to fill out a form listing all the deliverable first and last name combinations. They'll return it to the sender if you send it to a name not submitted on the proper form.

    At what point does a package not get sent on if you use a fake name in the US? Street level? Does the postman know everyone that lives at your house and that of everyone in the suburb? So any slight variation of name or even change of the person residing at the premises will not get delivered?
    <br/>
    Mail sorting facility? As far as I know mail only gets sorted automatically to postcode/zipcode and then gets manually sorted into postman pats mail bag. They sorting names and not addresses these days? USPS sounds extremely efficient. To know who resides where at all times.... ::)

    Only speculation but I assume the sorting machines are able to flag names tied to an address as well. I imagine this is how the FREE mail forwarding forwarding in America works. It probably wouldn't be free if it had to be done at a local level manually by the postman. It gets tossed into a separate bin and then the same people that manually enter addresses into the computers that can't be read by the machines slap the new address sticker on the envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They probably do this task during any down time they might have, explaining the slightly extended delays with delivery and the service being provided for free.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The whole goal of the postal system is to remove people from the process as much as humanly possible. For efficiency reasons, both speed wise and economics. National postal systems are expensive to run in the digital age, with ever increasing transportation and labor costs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just ship under 20 grams total weight of powders (or request ground up weed you potheads - no one cares how your nugs look)  from trusted vendors who switch up their style daily, and use proper packing techniques.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Order from C63AMG and watch your package arrive. Appreciate the level of detail and know why it gets through no problem in Europe, and very high rates internationally. The only way those packs can get caught is by customs manually peering into the envelope, either by the alleged pin hole cam technique, or more likely an x-ray belt mass scanning mail. But even then people that have to look at mail scroll by on a screen all day will get bored and not watch the screen. Packs will get by.  Way to cut down on this human flaw would be two people viewing the feed in separate areas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australian customs, if you want to catch more packs there ya go. Not that expensive to implement given your lack of international mail and already modern postal infrastructure and sorting facilities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Glad I am not a drug user in Australia.
    <br/>

    This is only an educated guess though.
