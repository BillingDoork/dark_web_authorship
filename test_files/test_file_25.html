    This couldn't have been said better. If you don't have anything they can pin on you, you don't have anything to worry about.

    the heat was the bozos who got caught in esperance. If you read that news you find that they got busted by their mom who rightly wondered why her darlings were suddenly receiving so many international business envelopes. She called the cops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So cops got together with esperance auspost, and they started checking the *100* international articles a day passing through that local sorting center. Fuck. just 100? they could be done by 10am and that task force spends the rest of the day kicking back. Anyway after they intercepted a whole bunch they then haul the crying teens up, and of course they admit everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stupidity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The moral of the story I think is if you live in a low population area forget your dreams of becoming a vendor, your incoming shit will stick out and if you mummy doesn't twig, auspost will.

    Aus Post are now xraying every piece of domestic and international post. They have just finished training 500,000 canine's to inspect every piece of incoming international mail. Julia Gillard is now personally inspecting every piece of domestic mail to make sure Matrix's mdma and acid tabs do not make it around the country. ORDER WITH CAUTION (In fact don't order at all, better yet don't even log into SR they know who we are)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    p.s do the rest of the aussie community a favour and delete this stupid thread asapÂ  &gt;:(

    Everything is covered elsewhere but you wouldn't know that because you would rather start a new thread than being bothered to do some reading you lazy bastard. Seriously is it any wonder AU gets flamed so much on here with this shit getting put up day after day.
