    After talking to a friend of mine that works for the USPS we came to the conclusion that most seized packages were shipped in air tight packaging but the drug dogs still flagged them. Not because they felt odd or were too big to go through the machine, but they had trace order on them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So imagine this. You are a vendor and you have 10 orders of some good weed to fill today. So you sit down and weigh them all out. Next you vacuum seal the orders. Then you place the vacuum sealed product in the envelopes and get them ready for shipping. Sound good but the problem is that you handled weed and then you went and touched everything else, or you may have smoked some pot in the same room that the envelopes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My point is that you should wash your hands and keep the envelopes in a separate room as the weed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know I may be a little paranoid but I would rather see the packages get to their destinations.
