    Placed an order for 100gm's from NL to East Coast USA on Oct 4, and Oct 5.
    <br/>
    As of now it has been 44 total days, 29 business days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I just assume a loss at this point? Have not received a customs letter either.
    <br/>

    Let me know what you think, thanks!

    I would write that one off.  Be thankful if they just seize and don't follow up.  That's a fairly large order.
    <br/>

    Be sure you weren't scammed as well....are you sure it was sent?

    Well who knows, im leaning more towards the scam side, vendor probably didnt even send. Seems like a reputable vendor, but you never know. Offering a reship for 25g followed by 75g once received.

    Don't think it's a scam... if it were, your vendor would be "Sorry you lost out. No refund."  The fact they're offering a reship is a good sign.

    Some vendors have been known to say they shipped...then actually not ship...and offer you 50% reship, so they make alot more profit.  NL to the US is always a gamble, though.  I'd use a different address for the reship.

    When an order just doesn't arrive I'm kinda hoping I got scammed. To me that's less scary then it being intercepted. I've had a few packages not show. Two of those times the vendors admitted they were never sent, the other time was on an international order. I was given a full refund but no idea what happened to the package. I'm hoping that it gets here still but that's looking more and more doubtful as the days pass.

    Yeah...i hate to give up hope too.  Waiting for almost 6 weeks on a pack that was sent.  At some point you gotta give up and move on.
