    I got this in the mail a couple days ago and didn't see anything already here about it so I figured I should share it

    "We're helping to make sure every home in America gets convenience, reliabilty and value when they ship packages using improved Priority Mail Flat Rate- at no extra charge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Imprved USPS Tracking. From pickup to final delivery and many points in between, it's easy to get updates on your Priority Mail package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Insurance is free. Most packages qualify for insurance up to $50 at no charge to help save you money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Know when it is expected to arrive. Now 1,2 or 3 day specific delivery means we can tell you what day your package is scheduled to arrive. Or you can choose Priority Mail Express, formerly Express Mail, for overnight service along with day and time specific, by noon or 3 pm with a money back guarentee.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, you can still depend on low Flat Rate pricing, free Package Pickup and free delivery of Priority Mail shipping boxes and envelopes right to your door.
    <br/>

    Oh hehe. I wasn't scared or anything I was just informing the community of the new practices. With the improved tracking and insurance, is this something to consider utilizing for vendors? It seems like it'd be good for them but I assume if they're not already doing it, there's probably a reason.

    Guy to post office after package is lost: "No, I'm telling you it was primo Bolivian right off the brick, not that street shit that's been stomped on several times. Now give me $120 or a gram of the good stuff."
