    So hi everyone!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before making my first purchase on the road, I would like to ask something.. My problem is that I have recently moved to Austria, and since then I have bought twice from Amazon. While it wasn't shipped with DHL or UPS, but with the normal mail system, I always had to go to the post office and sign something before getting my package. Also, the packages would clearly have fit in my mail box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question now is what can I do to avoid that? I've read that it isn't recommended to sign something in order to get a package from SR..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any opinions?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or is it unusual that I have to sign something, and I just had bad luck because it was from Amazon? But what if I actually had to go to the post office and sign something to get my package from SR?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help is greatly appreciated!

    Not sure on austria mate.

    <br/>
    But if it were me,  I would place a small order on the road.   See how it goes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they ask you to sign then just call it a loss, or sign for it.   Either or.   If you go with a good vendor with good feedback on packaging then you should have no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And smaller orders sometimes come normal post and not in boxes anyway.   I would say,   *package?  hummm I was not expecting any amazon orders today,   scribble your name, and then your sort of covered.     I think you will be alright.   Don't stress.   Good luck.
