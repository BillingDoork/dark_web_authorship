    We are hearing many stories lately of packages being open, inspected but still being sent to the buyer....Simply reading feedback on silk road proves this...We ourselves have also received multiple orders that have clearly been opened by customers yet we still receive the items? We first thought it was not possible for customs to allow us to receive goods they do not allow however its happening more and more often. Not just with small orders either  ??? ??? ??? ???.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any ideas?

    This definitely does happen. I recall a while ago it happened to nomad bloodbath with a gram of ket.  As I recall, they put customs inspection stickers on the envelope and sent it on its way.  About a year ago, if memory serves.

    I have read feedback for 100g methylone mentioning both the envelope and foil vacuum bag both having custom stickers on. Can't remember exact details of other orders but I've definatly read many posts on the forum's of users wondering how they actually received their goods. Another coke vendor had multiple customers mentioning the envelope being sliced open at one end, I received a order from a difference vendor the same way, one end of the envelope opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Each package we received was delivered to a different address each time and received some time ago and still heard nothing from LE despite packages clearly being discovered...Maybe they're just giving up now?  ;)

    I also received an insepected package. My guess is that they let go small quantities, because otherwise they have to fill a lot of forms, lots of paperwork and like everyone, they do not have much time to do so. So they'd rather not do the unrewarding paperwork. I believe they seize only big quantities so they can make the news.

    That's what I'm thinking. Never attribute malice to that which can be explained by incompetence. These may be lazy or overworked customs inspectors. Maybe they don't take enough time to recognize the contents. Maybe they just open the packages and slap stickers on them to make it look like they are doing their job. Maybe they just don't care.
    <br/>

    This is a busy time for shipping. We'll see if these incidents decrease after the New Year.

    I think we might be attributing the successful delivery of these packages to something other than the true cause.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't have any firsthand information regarding the topic, but I believe that opening packages may be a "customary" action by customs officers. Once the packages are open, dogs can patrol the aisles sniffing for drugs while officers are able to peer inside also. However, well sealed and packaged shipments are likely to pass this form of inspection, especially with airtight containers and packaging where the drug itself isn't visible.

    That's the thing. There are almost no "well sealed", air tight packages. The standard in this community for vac sealing is not good enough (there are several threads about this), especially several days after the package has been sealed, which is when the package is likely to be inspected. I seriously doubt your average SR vendor package would get past a drug dog.

    Never happened to any of my orders and I would be very worried if it did..
    <br/>
    Probably safe enough as others have said, could be lazy workers or they just let it slip if the shipment is pretty small on the grand scheme of things.
    <br/>
    If it did happen to me, I would get the order away from the address after a day or so (with it still unopened), get the goods shifted as quickly as possible and never use that address again.

    It's because they can\t be fucked to deal with the paperwork so they just let it slide. You'll nptoce that this generally happens with small orders, large ones they wont let go.

    Just about to bring that ^. I think there's a bit of difference from sending a goddamn bushel of MJ bunched ^ in a bulging packet to couriering small quantities that they may not have read ^ on yet because of their lower use/popularity.

    Customs officers are desk monkeys and probably don't want to write reports and send off samples 20 times a day over a gram or so of powder. I'm sure they're trained to immediately spot coke, MDMA or heroin but RC is probably a WTF for the field tests that they have.
