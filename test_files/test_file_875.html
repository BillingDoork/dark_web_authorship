    I have done some research and others have said that the package was just sent to the wrong area or address by accident of USPS (put on the wrong truck sent to a different area) and is now supposedly forwarding to the actual address I originally put down. I have also seen that the case could be a mislabeled package with wrong shipping info but I am 100% sure this is not it. The package was marked missent in even the same town as my drop address so it's not too far away. I have a feeling USPS just tried to send it to the wrong side of town or something. But it was marked arrival at unit yesterday on the 19th, then missent on the 19th, and now forwarding on the 20th which is today.... I will call them tomorrow if I don't get any updates by tonight... I just hope they are forwarding it to the actual right address this time as I don't need drugs being sent to some random for free instead of me. Worst cases scenario is that they try to return to sender or send to some random. I think they just made a mistake and then marked forwarded since it will be delayed in making it to my address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can someone put me to ease or give some insight to this situation?

    This happened to me before and, yes, it turned out to be just a case of USPS fucking up. I can't say for sure if that's always the case when this message appears, but my package showed up the next day.

    Update: They tried to deliver it today at around 2 and my drop location person was on spring break so I now have to wait until they get back and can go to the post office to sign! All is wellÂ  here!

    Just a fuck up on their end as usual/
