    Hi all , been a member fora good while now always had my orders arrive, A very nice vendor agreed to send me one of his samples in return for a review. The order is now late but not overdue, i have 4 days until it will auto finalize. i have already been in touch with the vendor who offered me a 100% refund or re-ship anyway so i have no problems at all, the guy is being more than decent about it all.
    <br/>
    my question is this.
    <br/>
    If i was to ask him to re-ship or whatever, do i click resolve? And then let him choose to re-ship? or do i let it AF and get a reship ? I know the second does not sound likely as if it Auto finalize's not only do i get a AF mark on my account which i in no way want, but i lose control over the situation, not that i really need any as the guy was being very friendly and helpful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So how do arrange the re-ship without getting an AF on my account?  probably a dumb ass question. but i appreciate your help.
    <br/>
    Hff :)

    Whatever you do, don't let it auto-finalize. Just bring it to the resolution centre and work something out with the vendor. If he agrees a reship, just send him your address again and hopefully it will reach you the second time around ;)
