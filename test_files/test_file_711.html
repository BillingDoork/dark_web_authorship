    If the pigs wanted to do a controlled delivery to a PO Box, how would they go about it?  Has this every even happened?  Looking for inside information from postal workers, LE types, lawyers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Elsewhere I've seen it said that the pigs would try to lure you into a private place like maybe reroute the suspect package to the residence that was given when the PO Box was paid for, which makes sense in that it wouldn't be such an expenditure of resources, but it'd be a red flag to the package target that LE was onto them and there still seems to be a lot of deniability in it even if you did accept the package at your residence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, how would LE try to do a controlled delivery to a PO Box?

    You do realize you are invited everyone with an opinion to speculate on what they 'think' LE might do yeah? So please take all replies including mine below with a pinch of salt.

    <br/>
    Controlled delivery attempt's to PO boxes are rare unless you have ordered a large amount of course. I can only comment on what I have heard can happen in my country and that has included LE obtaining CCTV footage of the person collecting the package and using that to build a case with other surveillance intel, basically letting the drugs through and then busting the person later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have also heard about the 'card in the box' scenario saying please come in and sign for your package which could go either way as sometimes everything is just fine and others not so much.

    Bottom line there is HUGE amount of uninformed conjecture on here and very little substance of fact.

    <br/>
    I think they would put a GPS tracking device in the package. When it moves from the PO box location, they come grab you.

    i think thats absurd.. yeah i have herd of that in a post some guy made..
    <br/>
    but
    <br/>
    shit think about it.. cops let u take a package with drugs in it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but they dont open it to see whats inside? ( you should know if its been opened unless ur a jackass or noob )
    <br/>
    they just get u on camera picking up a box.. ?
    <br/>
    then they arrest you the 10th time u do it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    then u go to court..
    <br/>
    and they have NO PROOF that there was drugs in the other packages they have you
    <br/>
    recorded picking up.. ??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so what? they cant charge you for the other packages NOR prove that there were drugs in them..
    <br/>
    so they charge u with whatever u got busted with .. and thats the only charge.. and even then u can deny deny and get a lawyer...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    naw man thats some dumb ass bullshit.  cops see there is drugs in it they are busting u the first time.. they would NOT let shit go through
    <br/>
    its federal .. aint no fucking local cop bull.. its feds..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    post office box is the best thing to do. IMHO
    <br/>
    cuz of this.. and they cant raid u..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AND u can share it with people.. all u gotta do is add they name.. then say yeah i had a roommate i was sharing it with and he lost his id so
    <br/>
    thats why his name is on it cuz he couldnt get one..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thats ur story.. stick to it.. fuck getting shit sent to your house where ur fam at and ur kids.. thats just dumb
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyways im out.. stay safe

    Never make the mistake of assuming what LE will do mate. If you think they would not intercept and then let through to follow the drugs to help build a case to bring down a larger importation operation you are mistaken I am afraid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if you think LE/customs could not open your package and reseal it without leaving any signs of tampering you are again I'm afraid mistaken.

    I respect your opinion but I should point out that I am not merely speculating in this instance, I know the details of the person this happened too and the charges they face are real, I am not in the habit of spreading FUD.

    well that changes everything u live in a country where they are cracking down on this silk road shit.
    <br/>
    and imported drugs..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    shipping drugs in the usa has been going on for fucking decades ..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they are on to it yeah they talk about it but shit so much mail around here that its damn near impossible to track down and have
    <br/>
    feds take pics of you picking up packages bro.. think about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    last year there was like 1200 some odd drug bust through mail..
    <br/>
    mostly people telling on themselves or getting told on .. OR not knowing how to package shit..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    think about that number.. 1200 some odd people get busted.. there is sooo many people shipping drugs.. not even just on SR
    <br/>
    BUT just in general gangs and shit.. its just not even plausible that they would single a guy getting a pound of weed in the mail when there is MILLIONS of dollars in
    <br/>
    drugs getting shipped every day... u think they are gunna hire feds to take pics of a guy picking up a oz of weed? FUCK NO..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    its just not gunna happen unless you have been told on ..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    odds are there yeah.. but there just like hitting the fucking lotta damn near. unless u fuck with stupid people who dont know how to package shit..
    <br/>
    or u get told on..

    I agree thelorax. If you use a PO box, don't have anything at the address on file, there's little to worry about except snitching and bad packaging. It will be hard to get a search warrant for your residence unless they have a GPS tracker in the package, and they use it to see that you took it home. If you open the package and remove the GPS tracker while on the move they aren't going to be able to maintain a proper chain of custody over the evidence. If they lose sight they lose most of their chance at a successful prosecution.

     To add to that I know for a fact undercover LEOs can do whatever is needed to further the investigation including using drugs &amp; selling drugs.  However I'm sure a risk/benefit calculation comes into play at some point, or is supposed to 'by the book'.

    Here in Australia they use AusPost and the "collection" notices they leave in the mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They'll stalk out the PO that has your package, wait for you to sign and either jump on you immediately, or they'll photograph you leaving with the package, wait X amount of time (usually the same day) and then come pay you a visit.

    im not doubting you meatgrinder.... but thats alot of resources to sit on a pobox. ofcourse if theres and ounce or three thats a different story. perhaps wa coppers were bored and had to fill in the day.. no-one knows...  I can only speculate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    regarding pobox's.... surely one would have opened the box with fake documents.... and surely one would have given a burn phone as contact number.... and surely that person would have ticked the option to receive a text message once something is waiting in the box. and surely that same person makes sure that what they are ordering will fit in their box, and that the vendor sending it will never require a signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    correct me if im wrong, but you are encouraged by auspost to collect mail atleast every 3 weeks from your pobox...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as for a CD...... your order, takes 2 weeks to get here, hits mail system blah blah. within 2.5 it hits your pobox. between now and 3 weeks, you would be 'expected' to pick it up.
    <br/>
    i just don't see it being practical for LE to sit on a pobox in the hope someone will come and collect. this, not to mention, i know shitloads of pobox pickups, that are indoors, no cameras, and not even possible for LE to watch what box your going after, without hanging a sign out saying we are watching.......
    <br/>
    however this is my opinion.  :D and millions of variables come into play.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now if your to get a txt saying come into office, or you need to sign, run a mile. your fucked ;D

    This is how it works in the USA
    <br/>
    FEDs will let packages go through the mail knowing that they are drugs.
    <br/>
    When they open these packs, they do it so meticulously that not a single detail will go unchecked. They do it in steps with cameras and document everything as they go.
    <br/>
    LEO doesn't care about the guy dropping off the packages, chances are he's a pawn. They will follow him and watch to see where he's getting everything from. If they get impatient they will conduct a no knock search and seizure warrant on the shipper expecting/hoping to find drugs in his possession. Then they will try to make a deal to get the shipper to roll on whoever else is involved, ultimately they want the source of the drugs, not the leg man making deliveries.

    just been reading up on how all these people get busted.. yeah they will let shit go through
    <br/>
    but every case ive seen they do not let them go through several times..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    once they have opened it.. that mean that they asked a fucking judge to open ur mail..
    <br/>
    feds let it go through only to bust them right away.. they do not from what i have been reading and seen in case by case basis
    <br/>
    let u collect your drugs several times then bust you..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they see drugs are in it. THEY BUST U
    <br/>
    they dont let u get a pack and then hope u do it again to bust u
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they do it right the first time

    100% I can tell you what happened to a relative of mine in a po box CD!
    <br/>
    So, he was ordering a half pound of mexican brick shit from west coast. Now mind you its a smaller town in Il he lives not far from me. but he had tracking and knew when it would be there. So he gave it a day and went to his PO box and as soon as he opened it and had package in hand. He had a gun in his face! 2 cops were waiting!  I guess they busted the chick that was the seller dont worry not SR! but they went threw her email which she operated and did this too like 20 people.

    You want to hear a real story?  in 2003 or 2004 long before the road. my friend had THE BEST FUCKING HOOK UP FROM INDIA! i mean val 10 name brand 10cents a pieces. any anabolic steroid, specail k by vials. any benzo and even last order he had oc 80s. Well, he sends money/ rupees to dude WU:) and gets a tracking # next day. Now he only tracked it at the mall. If you remember back in the day the local cable company were advertising cable internet:)  So like 4 weeks go buy and he checks tracking and it said last stop was in the major city in our town that the mail goes too before here. about a hour away. So he gives it a week &amp; goes back to mall. STILL NOTHING, but he goes to the drop place he was using and it had a card left there from day before for that pack. needing signature at time of pickup or agent delivery! So. he goes to a pay phone and have his girl call usps.  The lady said this is fucking weird... she looked into it and said let me connect your to the local office. Anyway he had the phone like between his and his gf ears
    <br/>
    Then a guy gets on and says hi there was a problem with tracking but no worries its safe at your local post. So. he tells me about it and i tell him man i have that gut feeling DONT FUCKING GO. Anyway, the guy on the phone tells her You have to make it to the post office by 3pm because the manager leaves and it will be locked up for the weekend. Right then he should have said fuck that!!!!
    <br/>
    So he left and his girl was a pill head bad. fiend. at time he was getting everything from dude and would always show me. he got anabolics for a guy at the gym and so on. but this pack it had 20 oc name brand 80s for $15 a piece. So I was with them earlier and we both told her no way its a set up its the cops. but this crazy girl was bound and determined to get it! So back then i smoked so we all smoke they drop me off down the road and they go. with nothing in the car!! im far away but close enough to see him drop her off and park. I wait 5 minutes.  then 10. then 15.
    <br/>
    I say to myself fuck. So this huge fat guy bald walks up to his car and says his name i see the break lights he tried to dip. This asshole pulls out a gun and badge. I almost shit. So long story short. I am watching them thinking they are going to fucking prison! They had 10 cops some were in the post office  interviewing his gf and for a chick she held her ground she said she didnt know shit. Now i  dont know if they got off because his girl never had possession of the pack. but this was a smart guy. I mean obviously this wasnt but he was quick on his feet. So i see a big fat italian looking dude walk up to my friend no gun i could see. just a badge around his neck it was a postal inspector. he drove a hour from the city for this shit. Any way. They did not snitch and i do know how he talked his way out of it but he got out of it. but what i learned from this was
    <br/>
    follow your gut!  and they def do CD because they left that card at the place so they were there to get him to take poss. and if i did not see it i would not have believed it! but another true story I think with all the new laws now they would both been fucked! I am glad i saw this when i was like 26 or 27 or i may have made a similar mistake but figured since you said good to hear a real story thought id throw the only other one i know:) I have heard shit i mean i kinda believe
    <br/>
    and read in paper that a lady had 10 pounds delivered from cali and in paper they left it at the door(so all this they need signature) i dont think so. They also waited several hours until she left with it in her van. She later confessed she was doing a friend a favor and was on the way to drop it off, She snitched and set him up. I know because he was arrested to in same article.
    <br/>
    well hope this helps and its interesting as well
    <br/>
    BE SAFE. BE SMART AND IF EVERY PUT IN THE SITUATION BE QUIET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    <br/>
    Hey i have a question i have a pack on the way. Its been in customs for week but it never said inbound into customs just inbound out of customs (clearing united states customs) now that was thursday at evening. Now since then it should go to the next hub in that state then the next day be here.  Well 5 days nothing!!! fuck
    <br/>
    do you think i am in the clear because it said cleared customs? me i am nervous thinking its a way for them to bide there time. Now i have had a order from same place with tracking inbound out of customs on a friday and did not move until monday. So i did not know with presidents day monday...? i mean i know they are open every day but is the hub? are they backed up? i mean be honest do you think i am in the clear since say it cleared customs?
    <br/>
    and wtf do you think i should expect&gt;
    <br/>
    thank you for your time ill +1 for your answer:)

    I just dont get why if it cleared 6 days later it has not left! i mean yeah it may have and not scanned in? i dont know but this tracking is some BULLSHIT. I mean sometimes it updates instantly and other times i have checked it and said nothing then 3 days later nothing then a day later and it updates and says something from days ago that should have showed long ago. I dont get it and i do not want to check it too much and raise flags. I just hope either tomorrow its delivered or atleast shows it moves man or i am going to be noyed!
    <br/>
    well if you have anything else inspiring or something you been threw to help appreciate it!

    I'm no expert on US customs but from what i've read on here tracking is often unreliable and the status can sometimes go days without being updated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just out of interest what does the tracking status say when a shipment gets seized? does it just not progress beyond arrived at customs?

    well i had a buddy had one seized at customs. It never updated and my other friend the one i told the story about few posts up. one with his girl. Hell it said made threw customs and even made to the states closest processing sort faciliy. like if you mail a letter from a small town that we were in, In IL it would go to burbank. Well it arrived there and never to our local town post office and i think that was for the CD. but this was in 2005 maybe 2006 that would make sense that is when they made the law that postal inspectors can open suspicious mail with a warrant. So yeah either it just quits updating or it stops for a long fen time then starts moving slow.
    <br/>
    but you really think i am good since it cleared customs man its fucking with me i cant sleep right and i do not want to keep checking it. I know one thing it arrives at my local post at 6am the day its delivered and always well so far has said item out for delivery. So my ass will be up before the mail goes checking.lol  I like tracking to know its coming and to know not intercepted well good chance but sometimes its just as disappointing as looking in a empty mailbox until it comes lol

     Just out of interest what does the tracking status say when a shipment gets seized? does it just not progress beyond arrived at customs?

    As far as I know from other it stays in Customs for several days then just 'disappears' from the system.

     Cheers for that website dude that will definately come in handy later. As for now, no dice. It's either medievel systems or seizure...
     <br/>
     I'm gonna go with medievel systems cos I've stressed hard too many orders only for them to just show up. Ima gonna chill for now, there's a LOT of post floating around the world right now. Mine is not special.  ;D
