    Received package last week of a completely legal powder (but could appear illegal before testing) shipped UK to UK. First thing i noticed was the Royal Mail plastic bag around it saying 'sorry your item has reached you in this condition' first thoughts where...it's been opened and inspected, not at all a problem as its completly legal however I thought domestic customs did not exist? The package was defiantly inspected as some of the powder was leaking out of sealed bag as well as the envelope being cut along the side. Thoughts?

    Domestic "England, Scotland, Wales" is NOT inspected, no mail is inspected. Unless of course you recieved a package? Mail does not get inspected honestly I have friends who are postmen, we do not have the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UNLESS of course its leaking white powder out of it, the "Sorry" is probably some postie got it wet or something, or the sender didnt pack adequately.

    the letter was sealed along the usual top bit, and taped. The side however had been clearly cut open with a knife etc, so the letter was defiantly opened up at some stage 100%

    No visits/letters or anything similar so my guess is it may of been leaking slightly before and the postman decided to 'inspect' himself before posting...Quite odd if that's the case though as that means my postman happily knowingly posted me a white powder hahaha.

    Northern Ireland is part of UK although is seperated by a body of water.
    <br/>
    Would it have to go through customs for NI?
