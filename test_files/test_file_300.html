    Hey guys, as a vendor of fake IDs I just had an idea!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should'nt tamperproof stickers be standard on all packages for drugs/etc? They are the stickers that when you peel them off they leave behind dots and junk so you can't restick them on and to mark they've been opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Picture of what I'm talking about: http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00evKTHfmYYRuo/Tamper-Evidence-Stickers.jpg
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I've heard - when they get your package and want to bust you they usually open the package and check the insides for drugs and then reseal the package carefully and send it to you. Then, they wait for you to have it in your home and to open it up and they bust you later on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, if a tamperproof seal was on the bag the cops would leave evidence of opening the package which the customer would see. They could then mark the package as "didn't order, return to sender". This would rid the buyer of all legal responsibility for the package!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And best of all they are REALLY cheap!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This seems like a great idea to keep SR one step farther with being careful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will soon be implementing these on my packages!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good idea?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers,
    <br/>

    Why would a standard business letter have tamper proof stickers on it? Sure the documents might be sensitive, but IMO it would just make them stand out

    What about shipping the tamper-proof sealed envelope inside another envelope?

    I meant on an envelope inside of another one - this is how I normally ship.

    BUBBLE MAILERS!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you my good man, I didn't think about this, but would a postal inspector be able to feel detailed attributes of an item through bubble mailers (as the bubbles would alter the feel of the item).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically what I'm asking is by using bubble mailers, would it be hard to figure out whats inside moreso than plain envelopes without opening it?

    Bubble mailers really make it much harder to feel what's inside the package. That being said if you add a bit of paper to the inside of the package to even it out they won't be able to figure out what's inside the package.

    As far as my memory goes from reading an FBI document that was floating around somewhere (can't remember which one sorry, I think it was case file about a bust they did) they tend to reseal intercept post they want to try and catch you for so I imagine they'd use new packaging etc, the solution is to know what type of packaging your seller uses (although the problem also comes that vendors change packaging often and some types of large company produced packaging are easy to find anywhere and so easy to remake exactly the same)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So there isn't really an obvious solution (as with all types of problems related to this otherwise we wouldn't be discussing it would we) My advice is, they don't care about personal amounts so if you're ordering a gram or ten you're probably fine. If you're ordering larger amounts, know your postman, know your sellers packaging, correspond with them about what it's being sent in so you know in advance and do not sign for anything you shouldn't be signing for.

    I did a similar thing to a package in my thread in this forum section, using a black light marker to make small x's. I sent a second package to a close friend to see if it was seized, but instead of the black light marker I sliced sealing tape with a razor knife to make 3 X's on it, so the tape couldn't be removed without tearing.
