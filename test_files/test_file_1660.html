    Hey guys so I was looking over some of the shroom vendors and a lot of them go into detail about how they use MBB and the latest stealth etc and I was thinking "ok i get it what to use as much stealth as possible" but mushrooms are not even detectable by dogs (as far as i know) and I feel like the MBB are just a little over kill.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I wrong making this assumption. I guess when I get domestic packages I really just dont worry about it unless its got a strong smell like Pot or Coke or something and even then as long as its secured in a bag properly and no odor I'm good to go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think?

    Dogs are not trained to detect mushrooms. I don't use MBB, but I do vacuum seal. Not for detection protection, but to compact the mass and also to protect the boomers from oxygen.

    hell no, shrooms are the safest thing u can mail unstealthed. vendors either clueless or just marketing hype. either way the buyer will pay extra for it, mbb's arent cheap.
