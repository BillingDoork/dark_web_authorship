    So, every single international package received by everyone I know in my country has been open and inspected, and stamped with a customs inspection stamp....should I be worried about ordering items like a dmt pipe thats coming as a package and not in an envelope?

    Just make your own DMT pipe.   It's called "The Machine" and uses a small Hennessey bottle.   But yeah, I would be weary of ordering one if that is your situation.

    If its clearly used for drug taking and the country you are in opens everything then they could seize it, where the fuck are you? half the country must be employed by customs to manage that type of operation! either that or you live somewhere with a population of 50.

    Inspected &amp; Opened? You're sure about that opened part? Usually it's pretty easy to tell and there's probably even a leaflet inside any package opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Inspected and stamped might not mean opened in your country. I find it very hard to believe every single package is opened and inspected, that's an insane amount of customs manpower required. Unless you live in a country of 100 people and 10 of them are customs agents =-p.

    The pipe would be illegal as drug paraphernalia. Im in trinidad (small island in the caribbean) where lots of drugs pass through from south america to north america. I dont know if they inspect every single package, but so far from all the people I know that receives international packages (quite a few), their packages have all been opened and inspected and they are not involved in any illegal activities.

    If the pipe can be used for legal purposes and doesn't have any "druggy" logo's on it then it should get through fine. The customs declaration should be correct but vague, "glass kitchenware" or similar should do the trick :)
    <br/>
    I ship pipes all over the world and not one has been captured by customs :)
