     Checking DCN - did I mess up?

    So I was expecting to receive a package today that didn't show up.  I've had a few deliveries go through before OK, but this time I was going to be out of town so I asked for the DCN from the seller.  He was reluctant, but ended up providing it to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I made the mistake (or was it a mistake?) of checking the DCN through TOR.  The tracking information said it was supposed to be delivered today, but to my surprise when I get back into town and checked my mailbox just now, I could see my mail was delivered, but the package was not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure what exactly is going on, but my fear is that the package is heading back to the office for some sort of inspection.  I guess the good news is the package only contained a couple of prescription pills so hopefully they don't do anything more than confiscate at the worst.  I did a search and everyone on here highly recommends not checking DCN's through TOR (I should have checked here before I tried because I didn't know that, I assumed it would be the safest way), but there are also people who say there has never been a story of someone having their package "red flagged" or confiscated because they checked their DCN through TOR.  Does anyone have any updated info on the USPS and flagging because of DCN's?  I appreciate it.

    There has never been a proven case of a package being seized or someone getting busted for checking their tracking through Tor. As far as I know, it's a myth. I highly, highly doubt that they would have stopped a delivery that late in the process. It's not like they get some alarm notification that someone checked a tracking number through Tor. Plus, there has to be some people who use Tor to track packages containing legal items (and I'm not talking about RCs).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking this is what happened:
    <br/>
    1. Delivery man knocked, didn't feel comfortable with leaving the package unattended, and left. Should have left a delivery slip in this case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Your item is going to be delivered with one of the vans. This has happened once or twice to me. It seems like this happens because the package doesn't reach the mail man on time, but it reaches the post office for delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One last thing... do you live in a neighborhood where a stolen package isn't something surprising to hear?

    Thanks for the responses.  Since there was no signature confirmation as far as I know (and going off of past practice from previous deliveries), I'm pretty sure the postman didn't try knocking.  My apartment is upstairs the the box is downstairs and they always just stick it in there.  I've never received any slips.  I'm glad you suggested #2, Moon, because I wasn't even aware they did such things.  Perhaps their DCN "tracking" if you can even call it that has thrown me for a loop because it says out for delivery at 9:15 AM today, but perhaps it went with another truck.  And sadly you could be right about someone picking up the package.  I don't live in the best of neighborhoods and there is a lot of foot traffic around here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another question I have is if they attempted a delivery in theory would that show on the DCN tracking?  Marked as "attempted delivery" or the such?  Thanks again.

    Well Chan was right.  There was nothing to worry about.  I know I'm one case but I wanted to point out that I did check my DCN through the USPS website using TOR and they still delivered my package without issue.  I now do believe with high probability that the USPS does not red flag or confiscate packages because you typed in a DCN number from a certain IP or using TOR.  It's like someone else said in another post on another thread I read, the USPS is flat broke and I'm pretty sure they don't mind all the additional business they get from SR packages which is of course unbeknownst to them.  We pay the postman their salaries!

    Thanks again everyone
