    Hopefully someone can answer this real quick. I'll start vending here within the next few weeks (this is a throwaway account) for MDMA and Pharmaceuticals (Domestic USA only). I'm working on my logistics atm for shipping and I have the following question if someone could answer. Is it better to
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A) Use a generic padded envelope shipped w/ priority and DCNÂ  (And in doing so Pay for an Envelop + Priority + DCN). Obviously all labels will be printed.
    <br/>
    OR
    <br/>
    B) Use a USPS flat rate envelope shipped with priority and DCN. (And in doing so pay only for the Priority Flatrate envelope + DCN)
    <br/>
    OR
    <br/>
    C) Offer to do both as shipping options with a slight increase in cost for generic envelopes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd prefer to use a USPS flat rate envelope due to cost savings, however if its safer to purchase generic padded envelopes and pay for the priority shipping w/ DCN seperately then I'll go that route. Any advice is appreciated!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    Generally speaking, I wouldn't usually share this sort of info, but I think that I generic enough to be answered. I personally use both. You can just slap those priority sticker on the bubble mailer and put your labels not them and still use the priority stamp. I even use the flat rate boxe. I wouldn't use one set method. I find it best to mix it up and not use one set shipping address or method. Just an opinion.
