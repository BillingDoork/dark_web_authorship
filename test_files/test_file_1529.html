    I've been hearing lately from both vendors and users that Canadian shipments of MDMA to the USA are being caught more and that CAN is more risky these past couple months. I need to order a decent sized shipment, between 25g and 50g. Can anyone comment on whether Canada or Germany would be a safer country to purchase from right now? I'd love to stay domestic but I'm not sure I'll be able to considering prices of MDMA in the US.

    I've done both numerous times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had one instance from Germany where the package was opened up, but customs didn't seem to be able to find the product. All is well that ends well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canada has seemed to get some heat recently. I'm 4/4 from there so far. I do however have a package that is taking several days longer than scheduled, but I'm sure it will land safely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would suggest not making your decision on the country, but rather the vendor, and specifically his feedback, and stealth reviews.

    Not sure if sarcasm but have you ever heard of the DEA? :p
    <br/>
    You can't have anything related to synthesizing mdma shipped to the united states so it makes it hard to manufacture it here. Canada makes a shit load of it and has some favorable laws.  Not sure why the united states haven't seen a shit load of it coming from Mexico.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    keep in mind a few controlled deliveries have happened from Canada recently relating to Silk road vendors. There have been a couple of German/dutch vendors busted as well. Be careful and as long as they use amazing stealth you should be fine.

    I've never had any issues getting MDMA from Germany. No experience with getting from Canada though, or that much weight either for that matter. Either way, if your vendor has good stealth skills and does as they should your package should arrive safely!
