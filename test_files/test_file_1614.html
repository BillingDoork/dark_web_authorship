    I have been getting a lot of smaller qty buds &amp; oils lately to one of my drops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously this means most packs are coming from CA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I try to mix in some other mail from different states, packs and such. But not very often.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In one month I might get 3-4 different packs in the box, all from CA. Maybe 1 or 2 from different states(non drug), and then 1 from CO occasionally.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well it doesn't take a genius to know what laws enable in those states
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just think to myself that maybe the postal driver dropping my shit of every few days might catch on?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do they normally just check the address of who it's being sent to?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would presume that they would be under the impression that if "X" items were in the pack that it would have been caught regionally and they would have long ago been notified.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once they get the mail in their truck, get on route, and are at the drop. They have to legally deliver it right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess maybe he might flag the next one if for some reason he did ever get sketched out over it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's everyone think.

    a lot of legit packages com from Cali. it surprises me how much ebay shit comes from there, so maybe if ur dealing with pro vendors their packs should blend right in. im pretty sure a majority of the mail men dont give a fuck where the packs from just to where its going.

    There is a good thread somewhere here on the forums from as usps mailman. He talks a lot about how most of them just want to get their route done and go home and could care less what is in your package. Although I'm sure in some corner of this shit hole country there is some mail man who could not make it as a cop, but thinks he/she is one!

    White, I don't think it would be a big problem. I buy pretty much everything online, and close to a majority comes from the west coast (Cali, Washington for some reason...)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are nervous about it then you can get another drop if possible, or get it sent in larger quantites and not so often... I don't think it is necessary though.

    You could order a steady stream of bulky items off of ebay from the same area. Make it so random searches are less likely to find anything.

    As long as they are packaged correctly you have nothing to worry about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd have a second drop handy if I were you and start rotating addresses every so often just to keep your mind at ease.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck and enjoy what the left coast has to offer!Â  :)

    Depends, it is circumstantial evidence but it could lead to mail being closely inspected secondarily. The police are not stupid.
