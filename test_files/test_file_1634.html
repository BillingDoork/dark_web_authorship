    I have ordered illegal product from the UK, India, US, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Canada and China. Every single time they've made it to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered some legal research chemicals from the UK weeks ago from a legal retail site and I received a customs letter in the mail today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So vendors, you guys are doing a great job!

    I think maybe you should redact the specifics on what didn't get through. I don't know how high demand is for those chems but it would help narrow things down for LE since they prob have a record of what did not go through.

    Since they are legal the vendor more than likely took less precautions.
