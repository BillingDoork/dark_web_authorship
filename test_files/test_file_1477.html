    Hey SR Community,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I am expecting more than one parcel to arrive at multiple addresses, sent from the same vendor. There is tracking on each parcel, but the information that I'm receiving from some of them is weird.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One of them said that it was processed through a certain sort facility, then departed from that sort facility, and then the next update said that it was once again processed through the same sort facility. Why would it do return to the same sort facility after departure? Has this ever happened to anyone else? Could this just be a distribution error with the post? Does this mean that it was compromised?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another parcel arrived in the states at an ISC on the opposite end of the country from where its destination should be. Does this ever happen? Shouldn't the parcel fly inbound through the ISC on the side of the country where the destination address is? Perhaps, my vendor mixed up the tracking numbers or something...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone can provide and intellectual insight to this, I would greatly appreciate it! :)
    <br/>
    <br/>

    As for the first one it sounds like it was loaded to a wrong truck or misdelievered or something like that. If it were being held due to suspicion it wouldn't have departed that sort facility any differently in the first place. As for the other parcel I'm not really sure, that does sound very curious but if it had been intercepted I doubt they would give any information that would even raise such flags, it would read as though it were a normal tracking number so as not to raise any suspicion.
