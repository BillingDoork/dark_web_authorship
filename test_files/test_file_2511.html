    Hey guys, I'm sorry if this is a noob question but I really can't find any straight answers anywhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I've been just shipping out envelopes with DMT in them, and it works great because I can just put a stamp on the envelope and drop it in a blue box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I will soon be unveiling a new product which will require bubble mailers ($10 Psilacetin tablets, anyone?Â  ;)) and for some larger orders I'm definitely going to want tracking and delivery confirmation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So how does this work? I could theoretically go into the post office and just buy priority shipping and get tracking but that would be way too risky for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there any way that I can get tracking and delivery confirmation without going into the post office with drugs in my hands?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks guys,
    <br/>

    Go to an Automated Postal Center (APC) and you can use a prepaid debit card to purchase postage for USPS Flat Rate services. Find one preferably in a Post Office that does not have cameras. One thing to note the APC have a camera on the front of them below the screen but it is very easy to just lightly cover this. Dont cover it too much because if the camera recognizes there is no lighting the APC will say something like "Sorry, Im having technical difficulties right now try again later". With the Flat Rate services the cost of a tracking number or delivery confirmation number (DCN) is included. Then you can just stick the postage on the Flat Rate Envelope/Box purchased from the APC, along with one of the green delivery confirmation number stickers and you are set. Just drop off the package in a the drop box and you can track it online. :)

    Better yet, just buy stamps and get some DCNs. Stick the DCN on the package and add extra stamps to cover the shipping + the cost of the DCN. You have to know the weight and the actual shipping rate, but any vendor is going to own a postal scale.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Presto! No worries about cameras, no debit card nonsense. Just drop in mailbox and that's it.

    Any large envelope or box being shipped domestically with 10+ regular postage stamps on it would look stupid as hell and stick out like a sore thumb. But that is just my opinion.
