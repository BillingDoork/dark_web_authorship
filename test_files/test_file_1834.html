    Well hello everyone, I'm pretty new to silk road and have gotten all the basics down to being secure. There's only one thing bugging me is not knowing how 200mg of DMT would most likely be packaged. As I don't live alone but with parents, receiving a package would make them want to be nosy and see what I got. If it were to be in an envelope like bills ect. it wouldn't be a problem since I get a lot of college stuff. It would be nice if someone who has bought before could PM on how its usually done, since I've a few times that this cant be discussed in public.

    You should avoid having it sent to your house no matter what.   Have it sent to a friends house or open a Po box if you can, but if you think your parents will open your mail, even if its only a small chance, then you're putting yurself, the vendor, and silk road at risk by ordering and that is not cool.  There has to be another way you cAN get your dmt off the road, in High School, (especially being that I did drugs), there was always at least 1 set of cool parents whose house we could smoke at, or who smoked themselves, did/allowed whatever, you get the point.  order your dmt there.  if you MUST do this, Pm the vendor beforehand and explain the situation.  if you're lucky you will find a vendor who will be down to ship it in a way that reflects your best interests.  (shakes head)  i doubt any vendor wants to risk shipping to a high school kid like you, especially with 0 transactions.  Just please keep in mind that if you go cutting corners, order, and hope Mom/Dad dont find it, you're putting yourself and that vendor in a bad spot and that would be really disgraceful if your parents opened it and you told them about the site etc.  good luck, you might be young but Im sure youre creative as hell at your age and know how t work the system, so ind a loophole (friends house, friends sibling, your sibling) etc.
