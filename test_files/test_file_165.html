    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am a local grower and would like to start offering a portion of my products on Silk Road. I will be shipping from Canada.
    <br/>
    My main concern is packaging and shipping. I've been researching about the process and how to do it properly. However, I thought I would ask the community if you could provide me with tips and more information about secure packaging to insure a successful shipment. Because weed has a strong smell and isn't in the form of powder or pills, it is more challenging to package it in a stealthy manner.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you,
    <br/>
    Fusion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS: I will be offering Jean-Guy, Pure Power Plant, Purple Kush, and other strains.

    Double vac and find something to put the weed in, then put that in your package. use stamps, no dryer sheets or anything that smells at all fake return address and name, drop at place with no cameras.

    Thank you for your reply and useful advice... Once I get the packaging perfected I will start selling my products on the Road so others would enjoy them as much as I do. cheers.
