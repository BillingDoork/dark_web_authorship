    So theres so many opinions and myths out there on the best ways to conceal weed. Obviously I plan to triple vacuum seal the package, wash outside layer each time with new gloves on, in a residue free area. However does putting different scents between the plastic layers actually help? I've heard of some using Vaseline because apparently dogs can't smell through that. (Sounds like total BS to me)
    <br/>
    I'm only shipping 14g right now but would like to eventually ship oz's once comfortable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However after its sealed what would be the best way to conceal it? I've heard of some people just wrapping the vacuum sealed substance in paper then put in envelope and mail away which seems a little risky to me. I've received other domestic parcels where its in a Tupperware then triple sealed and in a small envelope which is then all put in the bubble envelope. Wouldn't shipping a small Tupperware container across the border be super suspicious?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know most are really secretive about their shipping methods however if anyone can give me some decent advice that would be appreciated.
    <br/>
    Its my first time shipping weed internationally and I want to make sure its packaged perfectly the first time. Probably better to PM me as well as the feds may be listening.

    i really don't think there is too much more that you can do, i doubt most of the vendors on here take it to three layers...

    umm..most the good weed vendors do triple vac. years ago,  i got qp's from canada with 1 layer and a bubble business envelope.  that wasn't a good look, but it made it.  best package method is to conceal it as something else which would negatively effect the product if opened..  and of course smell proof as possible; washed with 3 layers will survive a dog sniff in many instances.

    triple vac seal, use priority  box to prevent crushing
    <br/>
    <br/>
    that's prettty much what every decent vendor does
    <br/>
    <br/>
    some vendors go above and beyond with packaging with materials i don't even know wtf they're called
    <br/>
    if you really wanna learn look for those vendors and study

    I guess its time to go out and get a good quality sealer and see what type of stuff is on sale that can conceal weed.
    <br/>

    I like it when the vendor uses a Mylar bag so the product is not obvious. Then all that is needed is a 4-color laser printer and create a label complete with some detailed instructions. Label it something like Astronaut Ice Cream or MREs if the quantity is larger. But PLEASE include a simple bill of sale so it looks legit.
