    I've been sending parcels to my address with my name(not a good idea, I get that) and I've had no problems for over a year.
    <br/>
    However, I ordered from a VERY reputable vendor and it's been a month and a half and still no sign of it. It was international -- Canadian to the US.
    <br/>
    But now, none of my orders are arriving(at least they're just a little slow in arriving, *other* than that international order).
    <br/>
    I for the hell of it, ordered from greendaddy888 who had a vendor account at the time, with a 50-something approval rating. It was for five free xanax 1mg pills. I obviously considered a scam when it *never* arrived, but he recently contacted me saying he sent twice as much, in a very angry message after I told him I hadn't received it. He mentioned he had tracking and that it told him it was delivered, but no sign of the parcel. I just sent him a message asking for the tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The point is, I should've received parcels(*should have*) and I ordered just yesterday a bunch more and I'm HOPING that they'll arrive like they have before, from vendors I've been ordering from frequently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have gotten no notices of any seizures, but I'm just seeing "any" mail with my name at the top, just for other members of my place. Is it possible that somehow I've been put into a blacklist of somekind after ordering from pharmacypowder(100) and maybe they've somehow caught on even though he has a 100% success rate to the U.S.? Is it possible that *all* the parcels I've ordered under my name are now being collected and maybe I'll get setup for some controlled delivery by law enforcement? I have an account that I've been active with for over a year, and I've *never* had a problem like this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could all my parcels that I've ordered recently under my name are now being withheld from being sent to me? Or am I just overreacting? This guy who sold the free xanax said he had proof he sent it through tracking(he probably won't respond for a while so that's why I'm posting this, I'm freaking out here). Please, somebody, with any experience whatsoever, am I overreacting or is the USPS been instructed somehow to hold any and all parcels? I have gotten no seizure notices whatsoever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, note that the guy who sold me the "free xanax", was a domestic order. He claims he has the tracking and has proof that it was delivered, I sent him a message asking for the tracking, no reply as of yet(just a few hours ago).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So am I being paranoid? Or has the USPS been instructed to hold all the mail coming to me by name? If so, will they try to do a controlled delivery? (I'm getting myself a safe drop box after all this)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPDATE 6//24/13:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    False alarm. My parcels are now coming through no problem. Me injecting my ass full of Testosterone and Nandrolone must've contributed to my paranoia. Thank you *all*, very much, for helping me out on this. I was freaking out for no reason, but I was still freaking out. So, again, thank you everybody who posted and helped me out.

    Okay, that's a good idea, and I'll do that. But -- in the interim I've made three orders from vendors that I've never not received a parcel from. With what I wrote on my original post, do you believe that my parcels are being seized and I'm all of a sudden on a watchlist of some sort? Or am I being paranoid? I honest to christ hope it's the latter...

    Very unlikely that the postal service is seizing all the parcels coming to you, IMHO. Are you still getting bills and regular mail? I can't imagine why the post office would keep your parcel instead of just doing a CD with it. What could they possibly hope to gain from not delivering it if they are trying to bust you?

    Yes, mail is coming regularly, but in the past 72 hours nothing addressed to my name, just to others in my residence. But about five days ago I got a credit card application from American Express with my name on it. I really hope you're right, I am FREAKING OUT over this.

    UPDATE: I *just* found my international alprazolam order. My boyfriend has been hiding it from me for weeks, and I've been resolving with pharmacypowder for over a month because of it. I just released payment along with a PM apologizing. With this out of the equation, do you think it's less likely now that my parcels are being withheld from me by USPS et al.  to build a case of some sort and perhaps perform a controlled delivery? What was worrying me the most was this Alprazolam order, but that's been rectified, rectified as in I will not be sticking my dick in my boy's rectum for a long long time. He starves without sex from me, and especially me since I order from MuscleRx and BigBuff and I've got quite the body.......okay TMI...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, a quick synopsis with this update from someone would be appreciated. Do you think that with this international order taken care of(which was my main concern, I thought it was seized) that I'm pretty much in the clear? Do you guys think that perhaps I'm just a bit overreacting, or do you think that USPS has been instructed my feds to withhold all mail sent to my mailbox with my name on it(like, I said to build a case)?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you so much for your help, gentlemen :)

    Exactly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My first thought when I read the story was someone stumbled upon your game and were taking that shit. A neighbor. Roommate. Etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You aren't Escobar2.0. They aren't building a case. Ask your BF where the rest of your shit is, and if he claims he doesn't know, he's lying.

    Its all ways good to be cautious about all situations like this, But it sounds like your in the clear, Your just getting personal amounts from what it sounds like Correct?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    About the USPS holding your mail, Cause one of the agencies out there wanna make a case, doesn't sound like your issue either, They would allow your packages to come through normally for a while keeping an eye on all your somewhat suspicious mail, and 'IF" you ever ordered some Un Godly amount of Drugs i would think then they would have a CD set up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also Don't forget the vendor with the "FREE FAKE XANAX" WAS A SCAMMER! lol, He was FOS , If he has tracking that can prove its been delivered tell him to give you the track #. Its not gonna effect him at all in this point. If he wont give you the tracking then u should be 100% he's lying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So when you have a Boyfriend that hid your 1 main parcel that got you worrying an then also paid for BS free fake pills from a Low life vendor, who says he sent something, but wont provide you with the tracking , well until he shows u different then id assume he just kept your Postage $ also causing another ordered you were looking for to not arrive.(never sent)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my final thoughts on your situation are its between vendors and ppl close to you.. You made those 2 very clear, so that's your issue, IMO..

    First off, I started interrogating my boy --my boyfriend started crying when i raised my voice, so I picked him up with one arm and brought him (thank you MuscleRx and BigBuff)  to our "fancy romantic bed" to snuggle and talk some more. What came out of it was he hadn't taken anything else but that. He doesn't lie to me. He thought it was heroin or something(large baggie full of pure alprazolam powder, easily confused with dope to the uninformed).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second, yesterday I PM'd greendaddy888(who of course, at the time I was ordering from him had 50 percent approval rating) and asked him for the tracking number. As of this moment the PM is marked 'unread'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd appreciate another summary from an SR veteran, vendors, high-roller customers and the like. EVERYONE thank you so much for your support thus far, you've managed to save my life via myocardial infarction.

    So, I'm no lawyer and I'm not sure how the legality of this would work... but it seems questionable to me.  How can they possibly be getting a warrant for random packages just because they found one drug shipment sent to your address -- that's profiling, not reasonable suspicion, right?  That's gotta be sticky when/if they prosecute at the very least, I should think...

    I dont think you have anything to worry about, but on a side note USPS fed ex and ups can FLAG your address which makes all your mail subject to a drug dog.  There are many different things that can cause your address to get flagged...My one friend had 13 pounds of pot come from humboldt county twice in one week to his house and because of that LE tried to do a controlled delivery on my friend but the package showed up 3.5 hours late so of course my friend did not accept the package.  Turns out his address was flagged because he had 2 express shipments that weighed the same amount that came from a flagged drug destination...to sum everything up FUCK LE AND FUCK DRUG DOGS

    All I was trying to convey was that there's nobody stealing from my mailbox, I keep a close eye on the mail truck when mail is delivered and, seeing as the coast is clear for parked cars watching me ready for a CD, I collect the parcels and immediate return inside.

    Then maybe you've just had a random streak of bad luck.  With all the ordering going on, even a 1% chance of interception will cause 2 or 3 in a short period for somebody someday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1% twice in a row = .01 * .01 = .0001 = .01% chance of happening.  So if it finally did, doesn't seem all that surprising to me personally.
