    So you finally got some bitcoins? Congratulations! :P I recommend encrypting your address with PGP though, it's really not hard to learn and it's worth it. What are you gonna order? I hope it's not cyanide...

    Lol... Have you even read the wiki? You made your PIN when you registered your account... Also, you should use PGP!
    <br/>
    http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/  &lt;-- PGP tutorial
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't know your PIN just make a new account :P How much did the SR family give you? :O 10g is quite a lot. It's good to know you don't plan on ordering the cyanide anymore though.

    I would highly advise using pgp encryption. I use gpg4usb. You can throw it on a usb drive and move it around or use it on the go if you need to. Pretty easy to use once you read a tutorial like a poster above said.
