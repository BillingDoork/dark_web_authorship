    So been waiting for a few packages to arrive and one vendor has cancelled an order after me waiting for fucking ages. Turns out they reck it wasn't gonna arrive. As it haps i get my moolah back. YayÂ  8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This got me thinking that maybe my address has been flagged. Assuming the worst cause this is the first time shit hasn't turned up and I'm sure as shit hoping my other stuff arrives fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But going through the vendors feedback I can see other buyers have had packages not turn up and they've been given refunds also.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My issue is that most vendors require a LL to prove that package didn't arrive, to protect them from being scammed. So why the buggery is this person giving refunds without proof that it didn't arrive AND its worth noting this refund happened within the resolution time extension period.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a buyer its important to know if the vendor is experiencing issues at their end so we aren't wasting time making an order when it may not even arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What say you all?

    Was in it transit when he cancelled?
    <br/>
    If it was still processing, when an order gets canceled you get your btc back. Could've been stock issues, personal, etc.
    <br/>
    I had a well communicated situation with a vendor who didn't use a dcn. Neither one of us thought it was going to arrive, and I didn't want a refund hit on my stats so the vendor cancelled when it was in transit before it hit time for resolution. I got my money back, got to leave feedback for some great comms and being easy to deal with. Only sad thing was that it definitely never came...but if it did I'd have sent the guy the coin for it.
    <br/>
    I'd say your other packages and orders should be fine.
    <br/>
    What vendor was it?
    <br/>
    I'd say lay off that vendor for a minute just in case there are some issues on their end. I wouldn't be too sketched by any means.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "AND its worth noting this refund happened within the resolution time extension period."
    <br/>
    Maybe SR stepped in an made a decision that full refund was the best situation with lack of proper evidence

    Yep product was in transit then they asked to extend the shipping time by nearly two weeks. Still had another 5 days before this extension expired. Then it was cancelled and my coins were refunded to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What's the go there?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm waiting on an order that is coming up to 14 days, longest I've had to wait but it's from CS and I've heard their shipping times can be a little slower than others.
