    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am considering importing medium amounts of MDMA semi regularly to the US and would prefer it did not arrive directly at my residence. Are there any solutions that allow you to accept delivery in a safe way without renting a place in a fake name or something else that's so involved and expensive? A PO box seems bad since you have to pick it up and "accept" delivery by walking out with the package. Are their any remailing services or anything that can offer an additional layer of protection from LE?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please PM if you'd rather not post something publicly. Links would be great too. If you have a stellar reputation I would happily pay some BTC for a guide on safely shipping, receiving, and tips and tricks type stuff.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.
