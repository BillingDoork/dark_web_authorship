    Hey I'm gettingt a US P.O. box, next week
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any recommendations on size? it'll be for ozs - qp's of cannabis
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And would this be considered a safe option, if I ordered from a select group of very reputable domestic vendors to a PO box?

    I'd like to know this as well. I want to get the biggest option just to be on the safe side, but it's so expensive in my area. Which option did you end up going with?

    our local PO has some pretty large boxes available that would fit most medium sized boxes, businesses use them so they can pick up packages after hours, I think. Haven't lost one to a PO Box yet, but a private mailbox like a ups store might be safer

    I just recently got a box with the purpose of getting things from SR and you should get the cheapest and smallest box because they will put a slip in your box saying to take it to the front desk to receive your item and all u need is a id.

    fake id = fake po box
    <br/>
    <br/>
    fake po box = ability to use pseudonyms
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ability to use pseudonyms = priceless
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you pay their fee, most large po's dont give a fuck- especially if you get a po box in a very public place... its just mail
    <br/>
    just make sure you have a vendor with a reliable shipping method that you trust
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also, id get a box large enough off the bat for what you are planning on receiving....
    <br/>
    so you dont have to go to counter to present fake id more than once
    <br/>
    cameras are usually not in lobbys of usps stores where po boxes are, they are normally behind the counters...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this has worked for me for the last 2 years to get small personal amounts of things...
