    I've looked around and cannot find a definitive answer to this. First time buyer and I'm curious about how detailed the shipping info I send to a seller needs to be. Is it recomended for you to use your real name, part of your name, an alias? If living in a house with a malbox, it it advisable to have it shipped to that address or is it wiser to send elsewhere? My common sense tells me to use legitimate info to negate any scrutiny, but figured I would ask what you guys typically do... Any info/insight is appreciated... In the US btw...

    I've only completed one transaction so far(there were no problems), but also from what I've read on these forums and other articles, you should be making this look as legit as possible. Don't use a fake name, don't use a shady address. You want this to blend in just like regular mail. But definitely don't use a fake or misspelled name, becuz apparently that is a flag for USPS (I'm US too).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In terms of the info, just everything that you'd need to ship something. Typing it out in mail format keeps vendors happy too (i.e. 3 lines, first name, second street, etc.)

    Here are a few tips.
    <br/>
    Always use PGP If a vendor doesn't offer PGP then don't place an order.
    <br/>
    1.No fake names.
    <br/>
    2.Don't use titles such as Mr, Mrs, or The resident of. (Spam mail and advertisements don't use and higher tiers of mail service such as priority, or express most of the times.)
    <br/>
    3.No miss spells.
    <br/>
    4.Check Capitalization.
    <br/>
    5..Include comma in between city name and state.
    <br/>
    6.Keep name consistent. (Ex. If the name is Johnny you're use to receiving mail in. Don't use Johnnathon, or John.)
    <br/>
    7. Take a deep breathe and relax, and sample your products. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wish you the best and enjoy your SR experience. :)

    On the account page of SR there is a prominent green link that proclaims: Buyer's Guide.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check it out. It describes SR's official protocol.Â  Keep in mind that many vendor's have made adaptations for their particular business.
