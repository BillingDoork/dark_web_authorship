    Hello,
    <br/>
    was wanting some advice and info on receiving international orders in Australia. I have currently placed 3 international orders so far with the first one being successful but the next 2 never arrived. Both were from very reputable vendors so my assumption is that they were intercepted by Aussie customs (f*&amp;kers). My main question is now that I have had mail intercepted is my mail box kept in some sort of data base making my box useless for receiving international orders? I would love to hear from other Aussies if they have had international orders not arrive but have had subsequent international orders show up.
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Oh good another new thread talking about AU  :-\
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So you've had two possible intercepts to the same address and you want to know if you should keep using the same address... really?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You will most likely not get a knock at the door unless you ordered weight but seriously what do you think you should do under these circumstances?? No one really knows what customs do, you can bet your bottom dollar though they will be recording this in a database somewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use your common sense, the address is burnt.

    thanks for advice gentleman/attractive ladies,
    <br/>
    really was not stupid to enough to use my own residential address, just keen to find out if I have destroyed my opportunity to receive quality SR products to possible (EX) safe drop that I use to have....
    <br/>
    any other similar experiences of a similar nature would be appreciated. Especially low level stuff, similar users not sellers that may have had stuff successfully delivered after non deliveries.

    It happens, a couple of no shows doesn't necessarily mean future orders won't get through, you would want to be pretty confident in the anonymity of your drop though to keep using. A pattern of seizures could very well end up in LE attention and you wouldn't want anything tracing back to you or people you know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are confident they were defiantly seized and just not sent then it's probably a good idea to change up and get a new drop.

    If I were you, I'd test your drop address... have something legal shipped there from overseas, and once it arrives check out the packaging. If it's been obviously opened/inspected, then yes - don't have anything sent there any longer.

    I had a no show which I was mostly certain got nabbed.
    <br/>
    then a week later I ordered a legal supplement from ireland (10 grams) and it arrived without getting opened for inspection. Any x-ray would have shown it to be worth opening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would suggest you order a legal vitamin sent in powder form, from ebay, and see if it gets inspected. Or hell, order 5..

    I'm pretty sure in Australia address's are not 'flagged' by australia post but the goods are sent to the AFP for investigation if intercepted by customs. They would at a minimum log it and if a few a show up with the same address they will investigate further. Its much safer to just find another addy if you are sure you already have had a confirmed seizure, be smart about it.

    In my experience one or even two no shows hasn't caused any issues to an address but I am hearing from more and more people who claim one no show and the addy is blown and nothing more gets through. I have always posted replies on here debunking the myth of AU customs being super tight but I know of a lot of people who are not scamming and are definitely seeing a drop in success rates for o/s orders. My advise would be if you have a no show consider that address burnt and move on.

    Now that I've been on SR for a year, here's my 'no-show' conclusions based on extensive research and personal experience* -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    35% - You've been selectively scammed
    <br/>
    20% - Vendor was too stoned / negligent / running from the law to bother shipping
    <br/>
    20% - It was intercepted and is now being enjoyed by someone in Customs
    <br/>
    20% - It was intercepted and your addresss is now on record with the drug squad
    <br/>
    1% - It 'got lost', ever to be seen again
    <br/>
    4% - It fell down the back of the sofa, but fear not, we found it and it's now on it's way.
