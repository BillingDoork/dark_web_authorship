    I was thinking of having my mailbox tested for flagging, by doing what this guy did

    No letters, no opened packages, they're just gone. Any experience:?

    First, that sucks, sorry to hear you've lost so many packages.  I don't have any experience with flagged addresses, but you could also try sending decoy packages (I know etizolam has some, maybe others do as well) from foreign countries to increase the suspiciousness of the package.

    What about tracking?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Domestic and International?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you sure someone isn't snaking your orders upon delivery by PO?

    no no no, not that bad. I got my normal mail, I meant my special packages. They were from multiple sellers, and most were on sr. I just find it peculiar, no note, no staged deliveries

    have packages from clearnet vendors come through? I would try ordering a couple of small, legal things and see if they are delivered, if they arrive tampered with, etc., and ALSO do what the poster above said and test your address as the OP in the referenced thread did.

    What does tracking say? Does it claim it delivered?

    I don't do tracking on most of them. But today I checked the mail and I received something I had ordered on the road. The only difference is I used 'current resident' on a last whim instead of my real name, turned out it worked.

    That doesn't seem like it would've made the package less suspicious at all, unless it was a small envelope.  Packages don't usually get delivered to "current resident" so I'd recommend not ordering anything big this way.
    <br/>
    Did you try checking to see if your address is flagged?

    Why don't you tell us how you would check to see if your box is targeted?  I suggest stop ordering from Pakistan.

    I'm assuming these are all international orders since you said you don't do tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why would you keep having stuff sent to you after having so much not show up? I agree with DwightEAnderson, you should stop ordering from Pakistan.
