    Ok so I am thinking about going to Ultra festival next year and what I was worried about the most was how I can bring my pills with me. I wouldn't dare buy from randoms, so what is the best way to ship it or bring with me on a plane? No way I will ever put it in a condom and put it inside my rectum, can't even imagine the pain.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are your tips on sending it to my hotel overnight? or 2 day shipping?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would the hotel dare to open my package? Do I ask for my package or do I wait till they give it to me? and could should I do Return to sender?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no idea where I should have the return address to also  :(

    How long are you staying in the hotel for? Why would it be a normal thing for someone to send you mail to your hotel?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sounds risky.

    This is really common for legitimate stuff. Call the hotel, tell them that you need to have a package sent for to you there during your stay and how do they want it addressed. Some hotels charge a fee to receive packages. Sometimes its at the front desk waiting for you or at the business center. The hotel business center will happily help you ship it back when you leave. Just pack it however you need, address it, and they will put metered postage on it for you. Send your packs by express mail so they arrive the same day as you check in.

    I'd be careful doing it if your staying at a hotel with only people going to ultra staying there. You can definitely still do it. Maybe send it express in the mail looking like tickets or something. I'd ask the front desk how they preferred you mailing them there and be sure to use a padded envelope / vac seal (at least, maybe mbb?).

    crotch em.. multiple pairs of underwear and just put them in a bag right under your sack. if your airport uses one of the newer 'x-ray' scanners instead of a metal detector then you have the option to opt out for a pat down.. when i do this i say the radiation makes me uncomfortable or something like that. it's not that uncommon for people to do this and there will be signs saying you have the option. this may sound risky and of course it is but trust me if you do it right you don't have anything to worry about. because of my larger than average testicles i have been able to do this with up to 3/4 ounces of weed.. so a few pills should be easy.

    It's worth noting that they can be suspicious all they want, that still doesn't give them the right to interfere with official US mail.  Obviously that's a sticky area you don't really want to have to rely on, but the real problem is are the cops going to show up, not are they going to raise an eyebrow at you receiving a package.

    This is common in the business world. Those who travel often and require materials from the office receive shipments all the time. They should be addressed as follows
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hotel Name
    <br/>
    Receiver
    <br/>
    Room Number
    <br/>
    Street
    <br/>
    City State Zip
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Typically these shipments come from carriers other than usps, but usps would be treated the same. I would not recommend sending in anything other than a priority style letter mailer and use the return address of some business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A day before the shipment is scheduled to casually ask the desk clerk if you have received a package, they of course would have not but now they know you are expecting something and will keep an eye out for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Routine stuff.

    My suggestion would depend on how many pills/what quantity of drugs you are planning on taking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's like 4 caps of MDMA or something of the like, just put them in a pill bottle of capped vitamins when you go to the airport. I've NEVER had an issue moving personal quantities of drugs this way. Attaching drugs to your ballsack is another good option. If the pills are pressed, you can put them in a bottle of aspirin or something, that way it won't stand out to anyone on the X-ray machine. Plus, those people aren't really looking for drugs, they're more concerned about weapons and stuff that will really hurt others, in my opinion. And large quantities of drugs (100+ pills, Kilos of cocaine, etc).

    Yes, you would be arrested, and I'm pretty sure possession of MDMA is a felony in most states (which is an even bigger fucking shame than fucking weed being illegal). Of course it might not be obvious to them at first that it's MDMA and not some other pill, until they run tests on it while you're detained.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look, dude, smuggling drugs on a plane can definitely be done and plenty of people get away with it but you had better hope everything goes perfectly or you are fucked. Definitely just have the vendor send it to the hotel in a professional looking priority mail envelope, that would be safer.

    my friend who makes a lot of money, and DGAF sent himself a large parcel containing plenty of festival drugs to his hotel at ultra in 2010.  he did this with zero issues.  i have also received at a hotel it went flawlesly.  its not a big deal just play it cool, and use discretion.  an envelope IS different from a box
