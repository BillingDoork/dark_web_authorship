    Hey,
    <br/>
    I'm getting some stuff shipped from China and my tracking says "Your item was handed over to Customs"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm assuming this is normal because its coming from China and all internationlly shipped items hit customs ( I believe )  Correct me if i'm wrong please !
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just looking for your input SR !

    Thanks guys,

    That does not sound good to me. It usually would say customs is processing it, not handed it over to customs. It was probably intercepted.

    I've done quite a bit of reading and Googling my issue, and it seems like it is as I assumed: just protocol.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All shipments go thru customs if they are international, its just how it works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now if it gets siezed or confiscated that is a different story !
    <br/>

    Pretty sure the "your item has been handed over to customs'' is from the Chinese tracking and it sounds awkward because of the translation.When he checked on the USPS site it says inbound to Customs and that is normal.That is what i read into it anyway.

    but if the tracking gets stuck there for more than 4 days, consider it lost.

    if it was bulk, i hope you took special precautions.

    Sorry I came off a bit arrogant and rude there. No harm meant friend. I guess it largely depends too on the service to which you're tracking it through? Is it usps or what?

    customs may or may not look at the package. They sort though the hundreds of packages they get, toss most of the envelopes into the "clear pile" Punch a hole though a few, and examine most of the boxes very quickly. Mostly they catch the douche bags sending powder in in sandwich baggies without MBB. It also depends on how tired the dog is. I have had ONE package opened and searched by customs, and that was a package full of MBB from pluto pete.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many have reported customs opening their package, and closing it back up without even noticing the drugs.

     but if the tracking gets stuck there for more than 4 days, consider it lost.

     if it was bulk, i hope you took special precautions.

    Hey my man, not at all trying to be rude but that is totally false. I have tons of experiencing importing illegal and legal goods. Many, many times I had totally legal items sit at customs for well over a week! Sometimes they are just very busy and it takes longer than usual for stuff to get screened and sent through. I have also had many instances where I was importing very illegal goods from high risk countries (as they are big sources for drugs) and have had the tracking get stuck saying its in customs for a week and then finally it gets released. When this happens, there is no way that I will actual open the door to sign/accept the package but I will pretend I am not home when the delivery is made, since no one answers the door they leave a little slip on your door knob or in the mailbox saying they attempted to deliver a package but you were not home so just bring the slip into the post office with ID and you can pick up the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I of course then wait at least a week before going into the P.O. to get it....It's not like the cops are camping out at the post office for a week and I also bring a bug detector with me (can detect any electronic device, very easy and cheap to buy. they are even sold here) and I stash that in the bushes at the park close by before going into the P.O. and I go in, pick up my package and before getting back in my car I take a short walk to the park, scan the box with the bug detector to make sure there is no hidden tracking or similar devices inside, I then open the box at the park to really make sure everything is fine and then I will stash the drugs outside in a water proof airtight container before I get back in my car, leave the drugs there for the day and if no LEO come knocking I go pick it up.....It sounds like a lot of work but its not at all, it is very simple to import drugs the right/safe way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE IS:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are getting something illegal delivered to a residence/business/whatever that is enough weight to warrant a CD make sure that house is COMPLETELY clean of ALL drugs, anything related to drug use (even something as small as a high times mag) and most of all, make sure there is absolutely no evidence in that house that proves you actually ordered the drugs yourself....I would actually vacuum seal my computer and cell phones (to make sure no moisture could get in) and stash the computer and phones underneath a waterproof camo tarp in a forest several kilometers away from my property......Better to be safe than sorry!

    Chinese English is not "broken".. it's just fucked up, lol.
    <br/>
    so the whole "being handed over to Customs" is not too farfetched.
    <br/>
    and since he has checked it and it says "Processing through Customs" or whatever..
    <br/>
    normal protocol.. but some Chinese have good Engris.. and some write da badda Engris..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so not everything gets shipped and processed the same way.

    Perhaps one of you kind fellows can help me with some questions about it?  I'm leary of purchasing from somebody in person.  I'd much rather purchase from someone over the net with escrow intact and whatnot.  The problem I run into is that I can't figure out how to find or search for vendors on localbitcoins.  The only sellers I can see are the ones that look like they've paid for advertisement space at the top of that area.

    I was skeptical at first too. But it was easier than bitinstant or any other service I've used. Go to localbitcoins.com  and click on 'buy bitcoins'. The members that come up are the ones that are currently online. It will show what they are selling each bitcoin for. Some of them have minimum amounts and maximum amounts for purchasing so make sure you find one that applies. It will also list if they take bank deposits(I've found that chase or bank of america deposits are extremely fast), western union, money gram, or cash in the mail. You are in escrow so you are safe from being ripped off as long as you save proof of payment.

    I've ordered plenty of scheduled drugs from China and every time it says "inbound into customs" then the next thing you see about a 12 to 24 hours is "Outbound from Customs". The only time I got a controlled delivery was when I got a something different. I can't remember the exact wording but if it doesn't update for a few days they're most likely testing the substance and then will make it look like nothing happened and its on its way to your house. When this happened to me I said fuck it and made sure I wasn't around to sign for the package. If I were you I would say fuck it and go with someone domestic no matter how much money you may loose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW later I found out it really was a controlled delivery - long story but if I would have signed for that package I'd be doing 10 years in prison for a 1/2 kilo of benzodiazepines right now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just be safe! Be OVERLY cautious when you're ordering overseas.

    What do you guys think customs would write on tracking if they did intercept it? Don't you think they would just leave it and not give the person tracking a heads up that has been seized?  Because this would give people time to prepare themselves etc.

    I think it all depend''s on the quantity seized.If it is not very much it might say it was seized and you get a move letter if they are planning on doing a C/D then of course they would not say anything on tracking.
    <br/>
    I am by no means an expert though so not really sure.

    I guess that you are okay if USPS says that, but next time don't order from China lol...  Haven't you read the thread about the 2 guys getting CDs within 2 weeks off of 1 vendor from China?  Customs basically has a 3 course dinner with every Chinese package nowadays, they even go back to some of their hotel rooms.
