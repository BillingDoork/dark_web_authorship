    So.. I got my pack today.. It had a small puncture through it, and through the vac seal. A bit of powder was loose inside. My question is this:  If I received my package, I'm in the clear right? No investigation/ sting/ tests coming back?  Thanks.

    Was it a clean circle? Like a hole puncher? I've read on here a few times that they occasionally poke a hole in suspicious packages to get a better look inside.

    International or domestic? some packages really get beat up during transit.

    I once had a package seized coming to my house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The next 4 boxed which were clean had holes in them on the side. I figured that they did that and put a baby flashlight inside to see whats up.

    from what i understand, they'll put a needle in there and test the needle for drugs. the fact that you signed for it makes me think that you're kinda screwed

    IF the package made it which it did then you are fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    No Postal Inspector would let a pack through that is contraband, let it go without a CD, or confiscation. You are fine man, mail gets beat around. I once had a lb come through and the first layer had a pencil size hole almost through the second and final layer. It does go through sorting facilities, peoples hands, conveyor belts, planes. It gets beat around.

    The only way they would let it through is if the cops told them to trying to catch you with a large order once you drop your guard. No cop wants to go before a D.A and present an at eat of someone with one or two grand of any substance but some poll get comfortable And start ordering weight cause they feel secure. You are never sexy e.g. always assume the worst and man or girl whatever you are  and don't ever tell anyone either..please don't sign for delivery.

    That is very scary. With all these new vendors and buyers on SR it is so hard to know whose feedback to trust and which vendors know what there doing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a package come today that was in an unsealed vacuum bag. And before one that was rapped up in saran wrap and tape (that vendor is no longer around, go figure...)! We really need to call these vendors out

    Could be a number of things, I've read about small holes being punched in letters/packages many times, some people think this is where an ion particle sniffer is used to test for drugs or other prohibited substances, if that's the case though the particle sniffers don't sniff for shit as everyone who posted got their orders without any issues. It's more likely due to the rigors of having traveled through the postal system, as others have said stuff gets pretty beat up coming through the system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should however look into getting a safe drop i.e. not your home address, not worth the risk of ordering especially internationally to your home, do not shit where you sleep.
