    Hello all,
    <br/>
    I am still new to SR and after doing my research learning how to use PGP, about bitcoins and reducing my risks I am almost ready for my first purchase.  I still am nervous about the whole idea of drugs in a package going through the usps with my address on it, so I wanted to ask this question, and get some valued feedback from the community of experienced venders and buyers alike.
    <br/>
    Do you guys think it is safer to have prescription pills sent versus something like heroin for example?  I am only talking small amounts here but my thought is if there is any kind of drug dogs that come near my package on its way to my doorstep they would be more likely to discover something like pot or heroin versus something like morphine?  Is my logic here rational or does it not really matter one way or the other?  I would be shipping domestic withing the usps.  I appreciate any feedback on this as I still havn't popped my cherry so to speak, and the idea of having stuff mailed to me still makes me slightly uneasy.

    Powder is easier to ship but also easier for dogs to detect.  If a vendor does it right, pills can be safer.  Also you're more likely to get a CD for H than a couple Vicodins.

    Powder over pills for o/s orders as pills are more easily detected via scanners etc, powder may be more easily detected by canine detection due to quantity of the active ingredient (e.g. MDMA) i.e. if you are ordering a gram which would essentially constitute approximately 10 pills worth, however this can be overcome with multiple vac sealing (minimum twice) and careful preparation (clean environment, wiping the vac seal with alcohol between seals etc. If you are ordering domestically it shouldn't make any difference provided the packaging is done correctly i.e. the pills cannot be easily felt through the package.
