    Hey guys! I recently stumbled upon a fucking grade A idea that I do not believe is even available in the US. I have an accomplice who has learned how to forge active carbon into a flexible container form and also in nearly all sizes reasonable! This is picture perfect for SR because as we know active carbon is used to cover the stench that something may put out, such as marijuana or anything for that matter!. The active carbon eliminates 90% of air pollution, the other 10% can easily be made up for with vac seals, something Im sure most of you already utilize!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If any vendors or even customers who want to transport/ship/carry their illegal products 100% smell free then please hit me with a PM! I can then link you to my vendor page as I do not have the listings up yet!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They are reasonably priced and bulk orders are encouraged!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for quality I have not put them in front of a drug dog directly but I have been in the car with my buddy, had a dog called to the car, 5gs inside a small sealed carbon bag, and the dog DID NOT hit. It was bud from SR so I know for a fact it was loud! Hope I can increase the amount of shipments that make it through and maybe make a small amount for myself on the side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So guys hit me with a PM on here and I will be back with you having a price and custom listing ready!

    i dunno.. a few hundred lbs of carbon filters doesnt really keep the smell off the block from a grow room, im not sure a few gram bag of carbon will absorb enough to be effective either....

    I'm sorry, but this idea is... garbage.  The bags would probably be very useful for just that -- garbage.  But for fooling drug dogs?  Yeah, I really, really don't think so.

    Actually industrial companies use the same design and carbon filtered bags to filter out chemicals... That's where I got the idea from. If I need to throw garbage away trashbag, if I need to store non-harmful chemicals that wreak, carbon filter bag... Besides that they are super cheap in bulk...

    i think the real problem is that if they are not air tight it isnt going to be effective, a thin layer of carbon isnt going to do much and the smelly chemicals are still on the carbon, it hasn't been changed.  shipping your weed in a bunch of chard wood isnt going to help.
    <br/>
    like i said a few HUNDRED pounds of activated carbon doesnt take the smell off the block from exhaust vents.  a few gram bag made of the stuff ain't gonna do shit.
