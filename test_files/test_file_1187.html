    Hey guys whats up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I know USPS tracking can be notorious for giving non legit information but here is the scenario has any one else experienced this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Packaged was order domestically and moved to my area pretty quickly, and the last update was out for delivery in my city very early in the morning a day or 2 ago. Since then it has not shown up nor has there been any updates on the tracking number since.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know USPS tracking can be behind a lot and not update properly but it never actually jumps ahead of schedule does it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am 99.9% confident I provided to proper address as I always triple check it and use copy and paste from the same txt file that I have successfully used before a handful of times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else experienced this? Would it be worth calling and asking about?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Yeah that's pretty fucking stupid.  usps is just absolutely retarded sometimes.  I would go to the local PO and ask about it.  Its probably sitting around there somewhere.

    I just had a package(express) marked as delivered last week. None of my neighbors have it and the vendor is reputable - shit fucking sucks. It's not like you can call USPS and ask where your package is either in case it gets opened by someone. There really isn't anything you can do, if the vendor is awesome maybe they'll split the loss with you assuming you have good stats - but that is on them.
