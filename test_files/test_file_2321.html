    I have a medium flat rate box that I need to send out from the US to the US. I realized that I cannot put the package in the blue drop box because of how big it is. Should I give to the post office? I used a company's name and address for the return address. They are located in the same zip code (Post office and company.) Is there another way to send the box without being recorded?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any and all help is appreciated. I was supposed to send this out today and unfortunately it will be sent out either tomorrow or I will have to wait until Monday.

    Most newer post offices in US urban zones have a drop box just inside the lobby of the PO, with a slot large enough to accommodate that size box.  You can drop the box in the slot without having to hand it to a person behind the counter.  When I used to ship 40+ packages daily for an online business, I'd just drop them there and go.

    This advice doesn't apply to you if you live near a post office that wasn't built in the last 20 years, or if you live in a rural area.
