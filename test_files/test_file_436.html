    So if i ordered a qp like once or twice a month, to a house, and that qp stayed at the house, but there wasnt any suspicious shit going on or anything, and the package came from a highly reputable person on here, would i ever have a high chance of getting caught? From what i gather a qp on here isn't a lot for mailing, especially once or twice a month. But people sometimes make note of not keeping it in the same place its delivered to and what not, but i feel like this is mainly for bigger orders, like pounds+. This would also be domestic shipping, which i hear is a lot safer as well.. I only have ordered 500mg of dmt so far, from overseas and it arrived nice, but I used a friends house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And would it be wise to order it under someone elses name in the household who gets more mail than I do? Because the name doesnt matter, its who is holding the package, correct? Although i definitely wouldnt want anyone else getting illegal things tied to their name, that shouldnt happen/matter, correct? Because when i receive stuff its usually through UPS or Fedex (newegg, amazon, etc) and not USPS. My mailman comes before 4pm, which is a great amount of time to intercept the mail, so nobody else in my household should know about it.

    Thoughts?
