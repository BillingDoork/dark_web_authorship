    Is it possible to have your letterbox "flagged" in AUS, can anyone actually confirm that this has happened to them? or is it all hearsay?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hypothetically if your addy is "flagged" at what link in the postal logistic chain would your mail be intercepted in transit?

    In Australia, your address could be watched or (flagged as in any future packages sent to that address are intercepted and inspected) if Customs intercept a package deemed to be used for commercial sales. They would then inform the AFP, who would decide on a course of action after they conduct an initial investigation into the proposed recipient of the drugs. In relation to my own experiences on SR, I had 2 packages, both under 5 gram''s, that never arrived. I made these 2 purchases within my first 10 purchases here on SR and was beginning to panic. However, a long time down the track now from those initial buys and it's been 100% success rate since, with a lot of packages brought since then. Be very careful about the countries you order from, the quantities you order (best to break up a larger order into smaller ones IMO) and most importantly, the vendor's you use. Unlike the U.S,P S, which links peoples names with their addresses on their computer system, Aust. Post doesn't use any such system. I could address a letter to Mr Dick Head, send it to my place and it wouldn't make the slightest bit of difference. It would still arrive., regardless.  :)

    Personally, I think that packages intercepted at the border would be logged and documented before being destroyed. You would assume that specific information is documented by the AFP - type of contraband, residential address, weight etc. I don't think our postal system has the time and resources to 'flag' address' and closely inspect every package going to a particular house. However, if packages are repeatedly intercepted at the border and a particular address keeps popping up in the system then you could assume alarm bells will start to ring - its not a coincidence anymore. One letter, containing personal amounts of drugs will probably not result in anything. But if packages continue to be sent to that address and are intercepted it seems logical further investigation will be conducted. I don't think 'flagging' really occurs, but rather what I've stated above.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    See here: http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/7505130/We-were-more-Spongebob-than-Mr-Asia
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Over the previous five weeks, Customs had intercepted eight packages containing 181 ecstasy tablets, 1.1 grams of the psychedelic drug 2C-B, and two grams of heroin. All of the packages were destined for the house where Cook lived with his family. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As more packages were seized destined for that particular address the authorities decided to conduct a raid. Take what you want from the article, simply my opinion on the matter.

    I think you're underestimating the capabilities of modern mail sorting facilities. Look at redirected mail, they have no problem sorting by name only at one address with lots of different names to pull an envelope out of the system and relabel it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now flagging might not happen right now, but can't see why it couldn't, especially if enough political/media pressure is in place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I play by the theory that your competitors are far, far better at the game than you are. It makes sure you're on your toes. The moment you think your smarts, resources, luck or knowledge is superior is the moment you'll get undone.

    You could well be right. Whether they flag address, or do something similar to what I've stated above, I think we can agree that sending packages to any address that has previously had a seizure/missing package associated with it is unwise.

    exactly.. how hard is to write a small piece of software for the scanning machines, to have it send a msg, or add a note on the system that address xx has been scanned, and is now sitting in the 'to perth' mailbag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    maybe its not happening right now, as im sure the containers with 500million worth of ice is more of a target than a few thousand aussies ordering in an ounce or less..
    <br/>
    or is SR getting so big for us downunder, people are trying to move kgs of shit.. and they are now putting more effort into catching people using the online markets...
    <br/>
    remember DBA?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i would say its safe to assume, should you not have a package or two turn up to the same address, you are on a 'list' of some kind. and should you cease using that address, nothing will eventuate from it. keep pressing your luck, and its not unheard of for the afp to give info to the local drug cops, to at the very least, knock on your door with questions, or even conduct a raid of your address, to see what they can find.. ofcourse they would have to think its worth it.. anyway.........

    the way intl mail arrivals works in australia is it is split into low risk, which gets ZERO inspection, and higher risk (for GST cheats, mainly) which is selectively x-ray'd inspected fondled and so on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now the zero risk stuff are things like postcards, little letters, tiny packets from hong kong all that junk with those green forms declaring something dull like "gift" and a value of $20. For all I know every single item from the Netherlands, Columbia, might be plopped into the high risk stream. But certainly not all from USA, China, etc - there is just too much of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since it is already documented officially (by the industry group harassing the government to lower the GST level) that low risk mail gets NO screening, it is difficult to see how much of a hot address list can be efficiently run. Of course if you get their attention they're going to do something special, just for you, but if they could flag easily don't you think they'd do it for addresses previously found to have tried to cheat on GST (they don't).

    There are four major international gateways sydney melb perth brisbane but there are more than four places where mail maybe screened. For example there are mobile x-ray units at airports. I'm sure they run dogs at more than four places.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They have x-ray and advanced material x-ray devices, the latter  appear mainly to be trying to eliminate firearms and firearm parts from the flow and thus scan larger parcels only.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All finds are entered into a system that classifies the type of the find, weight or quantity, and so on. All drug finds regardless of quantity are tagged as major, whereas say prohibited wood material would be tagged as minor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is my impression that since the scanning/inspection stuff happens very early on, it is prior to any automated address sorting systems that could isolate stuff based on an address. Not to say that every day is a new day, they definitely have the data to determine a specific address is a repeat (more than one find) offender.

     There are four major international gateways sydney melb perth brisbane but there are more than four places where mail maybe screened. For example there are mobile x-ray units at airports. I'm sure they run dogs at more than four places.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They have x-ray and advanced material x-ray devices, the latter  appear mainly to be trying to eliminate firearms and firearm parts from the flow and thus scan larger parcels only.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     All finds are entered into a system that classifies the type of the find, weight or quantity, and so on. All drug finds regardless of quantity are tagged as major, whereas say prohibited wood material would be tagged as minor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is my impression that since the scanning/inspection stuff happens very early on, it is prior to any automated address sorting systems that could isolate stuff based on an address. Not to say that every day is a new day, they definitely have the data to determine a specific address is a repeat (more than one find) offender.

    if by first hand you mean reading the publicly available documents on mail processing published by customs.gov.au, and corporate websites touting the customers of their specialized equipment, then, yes. There is a lot more detail that I didn't bother to include - anyone curious, or disbelieving, can google for it themselves.

    As a vendor who's had 100s of shipments come in both off sr and not, my personal opinion is yes, you can get your address flagged.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No, it doesn't happen after one, or even two but I think (with plenty of personal testing) that ultimately you can totally burn out drops. This in my experience and includes both Boxes and real house addresses.

    It definitely doesn't happen after one or two no shows though, still risky to keep using though as they would be logging seizures somewhere building up evidence if they ever did want to make something of it.

    Agreed. If you trust your supplier and don't think your being scammed and missing too much stuff you should really be finding a new drop. Don't get complacent, your safety is paramount and just because you're getting drugs in the mail most of the time doesn't mean something can come back and bite you in the ass in many many months.
