    I laughed out loud for a couple of minutes.  It said a suspicious person dropped it off. I'm guessing it got delivered to the wrong address and the person was kind enough to drop it off instead of stealing it.

    We are definitely not crime-free over here in the US, however small towns (like the one I currently live in) have a police log in the paper every week with all the different calls they received.  It can get pretty humorous, a few months ago I noticed that someone had called the police because another person had stolen their marijuana plants.  It didn't say whether or not the person is a medicinal marijuana card holder but I assumed not and it gave me a chuckle  :)
