    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm new to the road, and loving every minute of it  8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope I'm posting this in the correct category. If not, mods, feel free to move it :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've searched the forums concerning international shipments from NL and gathered that although success rate is high in most places, NL is a slightly more suspect origin location overall. I've also been unable to find a domestic reseller of high quality mdma pills (200mg+),so I'm considering the NL option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my question is: How have my fellow Canadians experiences been with NL vendors? My main concern is the stealth, considering that customs is the real hurtle in all this.  If anyone has experiences/recommendations or info about this, it would be awesome.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers!
    <br/>

    Hey man
    <br/>
    Don't have any experience shipping to there myself but I would recommend you use AliceInHolland for your pills if you are worried, they have the best stealth packages I have ever seen on here and I would say you have an extremely high chance they will arrive safely.
    <br/>
    As you said, Holland is a more suspect country but Alice will hook you up no problem at all.
    <br/>
    I have made a few large orders to the UK with them and every one has arrived safely and very quickly.
    <br/>
    Say I sent you if you go ahead, you wont be disappointed and good luck!  :P
    <br/>
    (There are other excellent dutch vendors and I amn't dissing the others, just I am always blown away with Alice's stealth methods)

    Thanks mate, I'll take a look their listings. If the stealth is that strong, I'd assume the same the results would be the same here.  And I'll be sure to mention your recommendation :)

    No probs dude.
    <br/>
    I haven't actually lost a parcel from any vendor, from Holland or otherwise but I would recommend Alice if you are worried it might not arrive as that will give you the best chance possible imho.
    <br/>
    Also the pills are always very strong, delivery times are great, as are coms, as are prices etc etc, ticks all the boxes for me really.
    <br/>
    Let me know how you get on!

    I've received 3 times from chemical brothers to Canada. They have great stealth too. But my orders are usually 2-3 pills at a time. If you are looking for small orders you will get them no problem.

    I'm also looking at ordering from NL to Canada. I'm looking at the 10g molly from either FrankMatthews or Dutchaanbod, I've heard good things about the stealth and success rate from both vendors but 10 grams of MDMA is risking a lot.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you go for a well established vendor for a couple pills who has good ratings on stealth and success rate then you should be good to go. Also read up on reviews in the Rumor Mill, it will help a lot!

    Just go with Cloud Surfer and call it a day. I ordered from him and it came from NL to Canada within two weeks. The only way that customs would take that shit away is if they knew exactly what to look for.

    Agreed 10g is a large risk. I'm considering the same weight purchase for a future buy and researching atm.  fyi frankmatthews mdma has  very mixed reviews, from what I've read the older "white" batch was good however he is now selling a "brown" molly that has had repeated bad/questionable reviews..worth reading up on for sure.
