    I don't give lower scores for it but I sure do appreciate a printed label.

    I can say as a buyer that it makes you feel a little uncomfortable to get several packages with hand-written labels.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just got one from a vendor that was 100% in every other way, and that made me a little uncomfortable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still gave a 5 (I think some buyers don't realized that anything less than a 5 is not "kind of positive" feedback, it is negative feedback) because he just rocked every other way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In fact if he switches over to more "business-looking" shipping labels, I might not ever buy from another SR vendor.

    No, there is absolutely no reason anyone should EXPECT a printed label. There have been noted cases where customs deemed hand-written addresses, along with person to person packages as suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All this suspicion over these types of packages have been redundant over the past decade. With many people selling on eBay, craigslist, kijiji, Amazon, etc. There is enormous amounts of packages with hand written addresses. I think that the difference between handwritten and printed really is irrelevant today for those reasons. Customs is well aware that many packages of drugs have had printed labels, as well as handwritten ones.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The person who left you with bad feedback (presumably before even contacting you), is just an asshole who expects you, the vendor, to know his every preference for how the package is sent. There is no official rules that standardize printed labels (nor should there be. If this happened... I guess customs would be at an advantage in recognizing most illicit shipments are sent with printed labels slapped onto them).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since there was no prior agreement for the request of a printed label he should have sent, he has no right to judge you on that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He could have simply asked: "Do you print your labels? I only want to order if I know I am getting a printed label."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To which you would respond: "No, sorry, I do not, and cannot make an exception." or "I don't usually, but I will make this exception for you."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some people think they are just entitled to their expectations that they haven't even communicated; an absurdity. I, for one receive a combination of both, and this seems optimal for reasons I stated earlier.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alex: Please tell me that this individual, because of this single issue rated you LESS than 4/5 (that would just be fucking ridiculous).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't let it bother you too, much, and politely tell him that there is nothing on your profile page or in any rules that strengthen the importance of printing labels in 2012. There will always be punk asses around, and the best way to deal with them is to not sell to them in the future.

     I believe the Silk Road vendor rules require a printed label. I haven't been here long but in the online pharmacy community, any undue suspicion on a package is frowned upon. The simple act of printing a label makes it appear more legitimate. The goal is to blend in with regular business mail. USPS and US Customs packaging profiling pdf's clearly list a hand-written label or address or unnecessary prefix, "from:" as profiling techniques.

    Actually many pharmaceutical packages are checked for contents when passing through customs. Many IOPs (Internet Online Pharmacies) sell narcotic medication, and our governments are well aware of this. I've gotten many successful deliveries, and the only one that was intercepted and seized was from an IOP.Â  :P
    <br/>

    I still think it is hardly relevant, and that if you are expecting a printed label, that you communicate with the vendor first.

    Read the sticky: Profiling Postal Packaging 101. Handwritten labels are a no no. Even when I was selling random shit on ebay I would print labels just for the sake of professionalism.

    It is disappointing for me to see a handwritten label on packages from SR. I have not given neg feedback for it, but I am mostly disappointed that my vendor does not read or follow the recommendations in the forum, especially the stickies.

    Here's the thing, and I'll admit I didn't read this whole thread before posting this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the whole game here is to keep shipment styles changing, and in turn, keep LE guessing. printed labels DO blend in with business mail better than hand written labels, that much is true, but handwritten addresses blend in better with personal mail such as christmas/Birthday cards. Also, A lot of small companies use written labels for that special personal touch in their mailings. (I used to work for a company who did exactly this).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    end of story is, that if you want to force vendors to use a specific type of packaging method, tell them. Maybe they will accomodate, maybe not. Remember this isn't Sears, where the customer gets to choose even the truck that delivers goods.

    Yeah thats bull.Â  How a vendor ships their products is totally at their discretion--and many vendors put a lot of time, thought, and effort into their shipping methods.Â  More important than "blending in" to other mail, is "not arousing suspicion" toward the parcel in question.Â  If your packaging technique makes is appropriate to hand-write a label, then why should you be penalized by getting weak feedback for an otherwise flawless technique?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Really, though, most buyers don't know that the feedbacks are weighted, so if a vendor has 100 5/5's in their first 100 orders, and they receive a single 1/5, their rating will go down by more than just a single point, because the recent feedbacks are worth more than older feedbacks...maybe if you PMed this buyer and politely explained how feedbacks are weighted, and politely asked for a higher score, he might accomodate you.

    there is actually advice given to canadian customs, to pay MORE attention to shipments WITH printed labels,

    if you think about the majority of the mail, it is not going to have printed labels,

    I didn't assume we were discussing North American mail instead of solely US mail. Every forum I've been on that discusses domestic mail and customs despises a hand-written label. I've only received a couple, and one was opened and confiscated. It's common profiling technique, I snagged this from a random forum. If a vendor sent me a hand-written label here, expect negative feedback, or me PM'ing you to address the issue. You're not the one getting the suspicious package delivered to their home, or the home of a friend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS cracking down on drug-packages, package profiling techniques:
    <br/>
    1. size and shape of the package;
    <br/>
    2. package heavily taped to close and seal all openings;
    <br/>
    3. hand-written labels;
    <br/>
    4. unusual return names and addresses;
    <br/>
    5. unusual odors coming from the package;
    <br/>
    6. fictitious return addressee;
    <br/>
    7. destination of parcel;
    <br/>
    8. multiple packages sent to same address, but to different persons
    <br/>
    9. packages mails to arrive for delivery on a repeated basis.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most Americans use the U.S. Postal Service nearly every day. Whether to send bills to clients, advertise for new customers, or exchange letters with friends, citizens rely on the Postal Service to help them conduct their professional and personal business. Unfortunately, some people use it to conduct illegal business--namely, drug distribution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In Omaha, Nebraska, authorities have taken steps to cut off the drug trade conducted by mail. In 1988. inspectors from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service proposed a partnership with the Omaha, Nebraska, Police Department's Narcotics Unit to interdict drugs transported into the city by mail. Prior intelligence gathering revealed that dealers smuggled large amounts of cocaine into Omaha simply by wrapping up the drugs and mailing them at the post office. Smugglers often used express delivery methods because the demands of quick delivery lowered the chances of detection by postal inspectors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The joint operation has yielded positive results. In one early case, inspectors intercepted a suspicious package mailed from Los Angeles, California, to an Omaha address. Based on the subsequent investigation, inspectors obtained a search warrant for the package, which contained 6 ounces (186 grams) of powdered cocaine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The drugs led the joint team to a big arrest when an undercover postal inspector made a controlled delivery of the package to the mailing address in Omaha, and police officers immediately executed a search warrant on the location. Inside, officers apprehended a hard core gang member who had relocated from southern California and established gun- and drug-running operations in the city. The success of this operation and others like it stemmed from two factors: Use of a package profile to identify suspicious parcels and close cooperation between the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Omaha Police Narcotics Unit during the investigatory process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THE PROFILE
    <br/>
    To identify pieces of mail that might contain controlled substances, postal inspectors rely on a package profile based on a readily discernable, predetermined set of criteria. Past court decisions make clear that the regular application of a consistent set of criteria is not intrusive.(1) Using the profile helps establish reasonable suspicion, which is required by the Postal Service to detain mail for examination.(2)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The profile sets criteria for both the package's condition and its label. Taken individually, few of the criteria would indicate that the package contains contraband; however, a combination of these factors indicates a suspicious package worthy of a second look.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First, in terms of the package itself, inspectors look for parcels that have been heavily taped along the seams, have been prepared poorly for mailing, have an uneven weight distribution, or apparently have been reused. However, inspectors do not identify questionable pieces of mail only by sight; suspicious packages frequently emit odors of marijuana or of a masking agent, such as perfume, coffee, or fabric-softener sheets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second, package labels often provide clues. Inspectors look for labels that have been handwritten; contain misspelled names, streets, or cities; originate from a drug-source State; and have been sent from one person to another, not from a business to an individual. Further identifiers include a return address ZIP code that does not match the accepting post office ZIP code or a fictitious return address. Finally, the names of the sender and/or the receiver frequently have a common ring to them, such as John Smith, and have no connection to either address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Postal inspectors receive copies of all labels from packages signed for by the recipient. If a particular address receives multiple deliveries from a drug-source State, for example, inspectors will check with postal carriers at both the sending and receiving addresses to verify names and addresses. If the return address is fictitious or if the listed names do not have a connection to either address, inspectors will be alert to intercept future packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THE INVESTIGATION
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Postal Inspection Service bears responsibility for detecting suspicious packages. This type of investigation requires patience, because inspectors routinely examine hundreds of mailing labels on packages sent through the mail. Through these examinations, inspectors attempt to recognize packages matching the profile characteristics. When they locate a suspicious package, the investigation begins.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Present Package to Drug Dog
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Upon discovery of a suspicious package, postal inspectors notify the Omaha Police Narcotics Unit. The unit's supervisor assigns a drug dog handler to meet with the inspector and present the package to the dog.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Presentation strategies vary. Sometimes the handler hides the package to see if the dog can sniff out its location. At other times, the handler presents the suspicious package to the dog, along with other similar parcels.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The dog handler carefully records the details of the presentation for future use as search warrant documentation. The dog's positive reaction to the package indicates the presence of drugs, which in many cases establishes probable cause to prepare a search warrant to inspect the parcel's contents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obtain Search Warrants
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Suspicious package investigations typically require two search warrants: One to open and search the package and one to search the mailing address after delivery of the parcel. Postal inspectors and police investigators work closely to ensure that all documentation for the warrants is complete and accurate, important factors in obtaining evidence and prosecuting the case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Searching the Package
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because the U.S. mail falls under Federal jurisdiction, a Federal warrant must be obtained for any suspicious package. The police drug dog handler helps the inspector prepare the affidavit because they must provide the magistrate with a history of the dog's reliability and past achievements.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Having obtained the warrant, postal inspectors open the package. This important step must not be dealt with carelessly. The package might need to be resealed for a controlled delivery, so inspectors must exercise caution. To preserve fingerprints on any item or contraband, the person opening the package wears rubber gloves. Inspectors also photograph the opening of the parcel in a series of steps for use as future evidence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the formative stages of Omaha's program, postal inspectors and police investigators met with prosecutors to determine a strategy for handling cases brought by the joint team. They concurred that when a package containing drugs was identified, investigators would remove most of the drugs, leaving just a small amount to be resealed in the package and delivered later. Prosecutors agreed that they could argue successfully in court that the defendant found in possession of the resealed package actually had "constructive possession" of the original amount of contraband. However, to preserve the elements of the State or Federal drugs violation, it would be best if at least some of the drugs originally seized were delivered in the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After removing most of the illegal substance, inspectors frequently replace it with an imitation so as not to alert suspects when they open the package. For example, a recent investigation in Omaha located a large amount of crack cocaine formed into the shape of cookies. Investigators left several of the original crack cookies in the package but substituted sugar cookies for the rest.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On a practical note, this procedure safeguards against the loss of the evidence in the unlikely event that the subject eludes police officers after the package is delivered but before the search warrant of the residence can be executed. Omaha officers quickly discovered that suspects often attempt to leave the location with the evidence immediately following the controlled delivery of the package but prior to the entry team's arrival.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Searching the Address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once the package has been searched and resealed, the Omaha Police Narcotics Unit supervisor prepares a search warrant for the mailing address. This does not have to be a Federal warrant, but the Federal search warrant used to open the package is referenced in the warrant petition and a copy is attached.

    Definitely uncalled for to give you a bad rating just because the label was handwritten.I would prefer it to be typed only because it just looks and seems more professional and well constructed.Like as long as my packaged arrived then Im not going to complain regardless.But it just seems more appropriate to print the label...we are conducting business after all.If its handwritten the first stereotypical thought that would come to mind is its probably like an 18 year old kid just dropping a couple pills in the box scribbling the address then sending it out with no regards for whether it looks sketchy or not.I understand how he feels about it but if it gets here safely then it must be working.Ha never judge a book by the cover,eh?

    To me it would depend on what was being shipped and how it was being shipped.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For example, for most boxes, I would expect a printed label.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, if they were shipping say several hits of acid or a gram of powder in a baggy and they placed them inside a birthday card to ship them, them I would expect a hand written label.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The point is to look like any other package or letter and to not stand out. There are a lot of ways to hide stuff being shipped, printed or hand written labels would depend on what you were trying to blend in with.

    I agree, it totally depends on the specific technique used by the vendor.Â  Like I'm thinking of a wedding invitation--if it had a printed label, it might arouse more suspcion than if it had a nicely hand-written address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the point is--if this vendor never loses a package, and has a 100% success rate, then this feedback will have accomplished nothing, except to pointlessly lower the vendors overall rating.Â  If the vendor *does* lose packages, then leaving a feedback &lt; 5/5 is understandable, but that was not the case here.

    Shit, I am in the same situation right now... after close to 30 successful transactions here this has never before happened to me.

    Vendor is handwriting his post and to be entirely honest, shipping needs to be stepped up a bit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This really sucks cause this is the only vendor who's got what I want too. I want to order more, but I'm too scared..Â  I absolutely agree that printed business labels are the way to go. Legitimate sounding business mail is far less likely to arouse suspicion than many other types of mail, provided other aspects of the packaging are up to par when it comes to concealment.

    If someone was sending a few sheets of blotter or something in a birthday card I can imagine a hand-written label is acceptable. From what I've read regarding mail profiling a hand-written label is a no-no and a listed profiling technique.

    4/5 and it still took my feedback down like at least a 80/90 of a 1% percent. What a lot of people don't realize is a printed label is more traceable than a hand written label. They can trace labels back to your printer and the ink you use.

    I totally agree...I have gotten positive feedback for handwritten labels depending on how I ship....if I am using a Birthday card to send something....I definitely would use a hand written label....when was the last time grandma and grandpa used a computer to send you a Bday card?Â  Duh!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's a package or priority envelope.....hell yes it's printed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have to match what you would do normally if its a business type transaction or card to family member.....use a bit of common sense and you won't look suspicious.

    Drugs NEVER get sent in the mail with printed labels ::)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS packaging "profiling" techniques bullshit....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you give out neg feedback for handwritten labels you are a whiney little bitch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe vendors need to offer the option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you want your labels?
    <br/>
    A) Handwritten. You want to mix up what your packages look like. All drugs coming into your house in the lastÂ  6 months with printed labels all look suspiciously the same.
    <br/>
    ESPECIALLY international mail. WTF would you be getting letters from OS with business looking printed labels?
    <br/>
    B) Printed. I read on the interwebs, drugs never get seized with printed labels and all packages with handwritten labels get inspected. I use my real name when ordering drugs online because
    <br/>
    I read that is a great idea too.

    If I receive a package that's handwritten I knock a point off (4/5).Â  This 1,2,3,4,5 system should have a purpose, otherwise why don't we just make the feedback options GOOD and BAD?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do so because I firstly find it unprofessional.Â  Secondly, typing the address makes the package blend in with the huge amounts of business mail being shipped making it much less likely of being profiled.Â  Thirdly it is written in the seller's guide that label's should be printed and explained why, here being the quote from the seller's guide:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Make sure the exterior of the package raises no suspicion. Look as professional as possible. The idea here is blend in as much as possible with the rest of the mail stream which is mostly "business reply mail." Please print your labels, as hand written labels can be a give away. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if a vendor isn't following the guidelines of the seller guide, and I don't like having handwritten packages sent to me, I have every right to dock a point off their feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would never give a 1/5 or something stupid for handwritten, just receiving the package is a 5/5, only reason I dock a point here or there is because I did not find the transaction to me to be PERFECT, and 5/5 should only be reserved for a PERFECT order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get very angry with vendors who threaten and blacklist me for giving them a 4/5 because I was displeased with an aspect of the order that they can no longer correct (if you are giving vendors low feedback for problems that can be rectified then you deserve to burn in hell :PÂ  but once a handwritten package has reached me, there is no turning back, aka no way to 'correct' this concern).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is the point of having a 5 point system if i'm just expected to give a 5/5 just for receiving, even if it was wrapped in a garbage bag (a vendor here used to sell weed taped up in garbage bags, like wtf lol).Â  The numbers should be there to reflect how the buyer felt about all elements of the transaction, otherwise I do not see why there is an option for a 2, 3 or 4.Â  This is a sticking point with me that will never go away.Â  If I find the transaction substandard and after contacting the vendor about it and there are no options to correct my concern I am going to reflect that in my rating !

    You should be printing out labels for the customers, yes. No, not all of them, as that creates a solid pattern to use to hunt for you. I've been sent orders from the same vendor that were both handwritten in some cases, and with printed labels in others.

    I quoted the statement that's in the seller guide, go look for yourself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I choose to leave feedback less then 5/5 I am not fucking with anyone's feedback, I am expressing my displeasure with what I would consider a LESS THEN PERFECT transaction, my choice to leave less then 5/5 has nothing to do with 'USPS propaganda', but an explicit reason for not considering the transaction, or vendor's actions/attitude worthy of a 5/5.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I rarely leave feedback less then 5/5, and when I do so I have an specific reason for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You know nothing of my purchasing methodology or history, so to call me 'unorganized' or 'irrational' is blind and hostile.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't do business with someone as angry and frankly anal as yourself anyways, so feel free to blacklist me if I ever try to place an order with you.Â  You sound tweaked, like a meth user anyways, in which case I have absolutely no interest in your product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are 3 drugs I will never touch, each with specific reasons (H, Meth, Coke/Crack), and if my instincts serve me correct you either vend one of these, or are a user of one.Â  It's your business what you choose to put into your body and I do not judge .... until your actions affect me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you wish to be so rigid in your beliefs, who am I to stop you?Â  But if you spoke to me in such a manner as a vendor serving a potential buyer, I wouldn't bother doing business with you and would find another vendor.Â  Cost of the product isn't everything, complications from a close minded and misunderstanding vendor is, however.

    LOL thanks for pointing me to the propaganda you use for taking points off sellers if they dont comply.
    <br/>
    I was being sarcastic. You didnt really have to show me the list. I have seen it.
    <br/>
    And you call me analÂ  ::)
    <br/>
    I think for everyone involved you should send that list to vendors before you buy. That way, if they cannot comply, at least
    <br/>
    they can save their feeedback scores

    I agree with the people saying that vendors should use typed addresses. I probably wouldn't take points off my feedback but I would note it in my review and probably wouldn't use that vendor again unless I had too.

    I didn't think they worried about ticking. I thought they were more concerned with vibrating, because every now and then....it's a dildo. Of course they never imply ownership in the event of a dildo, it's always the indefinite article a dildo, never YOUR dildo.

    I would advise the use of thermal printers, more specifically thermal label printers. Not only are they more secure, but they are very popular among Ebay vendors and other merchants online, due to their speed, reliability and general lack of complication in comparison to a house hold ink jet or laser printer. Note: pine does not work for the thermal printer company!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The US government, and no doubt others, have forced manufacturers to put special chips which put tracking dots which identify the origin of the printer with every single sheet of A4. Look it up, it sounds completely paranoid, but it's actually true, you can prove this to yourself on a laser color printer in particular, but who knows what other printers are being tracked but are currently undiscovered? Just google tracking dots and printers and you'll see for yourself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A thermal printer on the other hand does not work by placing ink on paper, but by heating certain portions of a special kind of thermochromic paper. As a result, it is difficult to place identifying information onto a an address label.

     Thermal printers print more quietly and usually faster than impact dot matrix printers. They are also smaller, lighter and consume less power, making them ideal for portable and retail applications. Roll-based printers can be rapidly refilled. Commercial applications of thermal printers include filling station pumps, information kiosks, point of sale systems, voucher printers in slot machines, print on demand labels for shipping and products, and for recording live rhythm strips on hospital cardiac monitors.

    LOL yes, unless your terrorist happens to be part of a 'cold war reenactment society' or is otherwise Ã¼ber nostalgic, I very much doubt an analog clock is being used as part of a time bomb. Postal inspectors have been watching too many films from "The Great Escape" or "The Bridge Over The River Kwai" era. Also +1 for the Fight Club reference, where do you think PGP Club got its inspiration?! ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I possess an old tattered copy on my desk I found in some backstreet second hand book store. This quote sticks vividly in my mind:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I see the smartest men who have ever lived and these men are pumping gas and waiting tables"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In today's West, this is a definitive statement of purest possible non-fiction. Because that's excatly what I see. My taxi drivers and postal workers often have two degrees, let alone one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wat do?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Join PGP Club! Stick around, it's going to get interesting fast.
