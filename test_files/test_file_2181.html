    The headline says it all. Iv chose to add 120bucks direct to my silkroad account through bitinstant and im gonna to cvs. The item iv chose is 8.99 btc. now i just wanna know what shipping is the fastest? The one i chose was express some which is like 2.33btc. My other question is i have no clue about they key u have to make, will it be safe for me to just send a PM to the vendor my address i want it sent to? Need some advice asap, i plan on putting 120 on here tommorw through cvs and sending it right to my SR account. This is cool and safe right? Iv asked simular questions but just wanna know from ones who used bit instant, Im not sending them to some other wallet im gonna use my SR acct # provide to have them sent right here.. This is ok right? Again please tell me the fasest way of shipping, id like to order tomorrow and get it here by friday at the latest

    Why have you asked all these questions before yet it shows only 4 post? Meaning why the fuck do you change your name to ask questions in here? Is it because they are so fucking terrible?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    J/k
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First like the title says..that all depends on what the vendor offers...Express is over nite 95% of the time. So it seems that is your best choice. And unless a vendor offers Fed ex.. Usps Express is the fastest available. And before some super nerd brings up a courier or something like that..that would not count. As no vendor uses them. Except for Lim if you buy HIS armor vehicle
    <br/>
    <br/>
    YES YES YES YES to all your other questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless you are in Antarctica or Africa (my bet based on your questions) you could choose the slowest service and still get it by Friday as long as the vendor mails it out on Tuesday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ask these questions to your vendor. That is what he is there for and I am sure he would love to hear from a customer. Especially a new one. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know your nervous and new and we have all been there. So just take some breaths and relax. Read your vendors.... vendor page. A lot of those questions should be answered there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also ....as to Bit instant giving them an address that is in SR is fine. Though some of the Security Guru's might have a heart attack me saying that to you. But the truth is it is fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your transaction is all going to be based on how good a vendor you chose. Since most are awesome..Your all good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Smile and realize you are less then 5 days from doing drugs you bought off the internet with BTC....Pretty fucking cool

    Hatter26 is a great vendor. The stuff he does with Opana is crazy good. Also he does ship Express and you will get it over nite depending on where you live. I am sure he will answer all your questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As to your post am I trust worthy ..... read my feedback. I think you will then KNOW.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck
