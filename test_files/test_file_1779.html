    Hello,
    <br/>
    So tracking on package says that it left the previous post office location and yet it hasn't been scanned in to the local location. It has been more than enough time to of made it to the local facility. It almost seems like the package has just vanished... What reasons would there be for this happening?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The stealth employed by the vendor is supposedly top notch (they have zero lost packages and a huge number of transactions), and the quantity isn't an incredible amount, perhaps a few times the size of a personal user who is buying enough to have around for a while.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm wondering what to watch out for if this ends up being a controlled delivery?
    <br/>
    Obviously, no signatures, and have absolutely no drug related stuff on the premises.
    <br/>
    Why would they be waiting to deliver it? Watching the comings and goings of people there?
    <br/>
    What will show under the tracking if anything is happening to the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be great to have some advice from folks who have any experience with this ordeal from either point of view...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you all!

    Theres probably nothing wrong and your being paranoid. Its probably being sorted or something and hasnt been scanned yet. This sort of thing has happened to me when ive shipped stuff.

    I have had odd scanning, no scanning, occasional scanning..usps is not exactly the most reliable when it comes to the tracking..I have literally watched an express package disappear into never never land and arrive on the 6th day after going into the system..it arrived looking like a drowned cat to boot.
    <br/>
    So hang in there..I have had one disappear completely and about 4 take from one to 5 days longer then they should have..it happens.

    Yes, waiting is important. It should of been delivered a week ago now though.

    What quantities would justify a CD vs a "love letter"? Something such as mdma?

    I dont like adding tracking to my trivial amounts of personal orders, checking the progress of your parcel must be nerve wracking. It'll show up likely, have a drink and calm down.

    I appreciate the thought of them keeping to schedule as to not arise suspicions... But perhaps they're willing to take that kind of risk to do a stakeout beforehand and see what goes on at that location.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I stop responding... otherwise I will tell about what happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone has had a CD experience, can you tell me if you saw anything odd happen with the tracking, what the CD experience was like? What did you do/what did LE do?
    <br/>
    If someone has had something confiscated but no CD: What did the "love letter" say and what happened on the tracking?

    Also, wow, over 400 people have viewed this thread...

    It is actually a good thing to worry. This isn't a game being played. LE really really wants to shut this whole operation down and the more "wins" they can display, the more funding they will get/the more hellbent they will be. Just because SR makes buying drugs as easy as books from amazon, it does not mean people aren't out there trying to arrest every one of us still.
    <br/>
    I wasn't freaking out, just concerned by the fact that something out of the ordinary was occurring: an overnight express package taking over two weeks. This is the first time any issue has arisen with a shipment and I was hoping for some sort of feedback from people having experience with CD's and what happens. I don't need to be told to take a chill pill, just attempting to gather information :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, there was no asking for more money, the package has just vanished. Some postal worker must be having a grand old time at this point!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At this point, I'm agreeing with ppanth that if it were going to happen, it would of because it gives us time to have our suspicions aroused.

    I'm going to assume this is a USPS domestic express order since you mention bouncing around post offices.  Not sure why vendors offer express or why people use it.  Sure your package could get through, but it's been documented, not just speculated, that express packages are a tip off to postal inspectors of a contraband package.  That doesn't mean that every express package contains contraband or is looked at that way, but it means that if you have some of the other red flags postal inspectors look for (like excessive tape, person to person delivery, hand written labels, return zip codes not coming close to where mail was dropped, etc.)  they will only look harder at your package because it's an express and they may have found you out.  BUT, it's also been documented that USPS postal inspectors work with local law enforcement to do controlled deliveries IN A TIMELY BASIS.  Let's take an extreme example and say your package is 1 month late from when it was shipped.  Do you really think a controlled delivery would be coming on a month late package?  It's a huge tip off to you the recipient since it's been so long that something is up.  Controlled deliveries appear to be timely and as normal as possible.  I haven't found much information on what the tracking might say if it was a controlled delivery, but I speculate it would look like normal.  It's obviously not going to say "Out for a controlled delivery" on your tracking so I don't know what you're expecting to see there.  Just use your head man.  If the package shows but you're getting a knock and someone is asking for a signature just refuse.  Hopefully your vendor didn't request a signature.  Did you message the vendor at all regarding this?

    If the order has vanished you might do well to consider all eventualities and not just assume a light fingered postal worker stole your mail, from what I am lead to believe from reading the posts on here that is not that likely a scenario given the penalties for interfering with the mail like that
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also normally if a CD is going to happen they tend to set it up quickly to avoid creating suspicions that the order has been intercepted, it would happen within normal shipping times (normally so I am reliably informed anyway).

    I still don't believe these threads when I read them. In the words of Ricky from trailer park boys: "Are they that fucked?" (USA, that is). Do they fucking scan domestic mail and sometimes catch cunts? Why would they bother? Or is everyone on this board just paranoid as fuck? and WTF is a "controlled delivery"???

    Must suck living in a country where you're actually scared of getting in trouble for buying drugs through the post, lol. Even when buying international here, if customs gets ya drugs they just take it and dont even send you a letter, let alone ring you up or try to charge you.

      I think this is why diazpeam should really be used for.

     It is actually a good thing to worry. This isn't a game being played. LE really really wants to shut this whole operation down and the more "wins" they can display, the more funding they will get/the more hellbent they will be. Just because SR makes buying drugs as easy as books from amazon, it does not mean people aren't out there trying to arrest every one of us still.
     <br/>
     I wasn't freaking out, just concerned by the fact that something out of the ordinary was occurring: an overnight express package taking over two weeks. This is the first time any issue has arisen with a shipment and I was hoping for some sort of feedback from people having experience with CD's and what happens. I don't need to be told to take a chill pill, just attempting to gather information :)

     <br/>
     Also, there was no asking for more money, the package has just vanished. Some postal worker must be having a grand old time at this point!
     <br/>

     At this point, I'm agreeing with ppanth that if it were going to happen, it would of because it gives us time to have our suspicions aroused.

    I've had thousands stolen by a postal worker on two occasions in the past 3 years. Keep a steady change of drop addresses, and DO NOT TRACK PACKAGES. All you'll do is freak yourself out. Workers are lazy, sometimes they don't scan your pack. Also, depending on the amount, it has been known for workers to turn in contraband to their supervisors. I read an article that talked about the painstaking process of filing paperwork for a contraband so some supervisors just threw them away to avoid the work.
