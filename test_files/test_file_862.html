    I've received legal highs this week, i've ordered mushrooms, lsd, 2-cb from this site all have arrived in good time, but for some reason the MXE which i ordered on 26th Feb didn't arrive, neither did the reship that was sent apparently on Wednesday, surely it should have arrived within 4 business days?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What could be happening here?

    If you don't get a customs letter in the next 30 days, it's likely you've been scammed because if customs catch two packages fillled with drugs going to the same address they will send a love letter, without a doubt.

    In more than a decade of buying things from the internet, many shipped to me through USPS, with 100% success rate, I find the high rate of packages that go missing on the road HIGHLY suspicious. If you didn't get your package, and the vendor didn't use packaging methods that were complete shit, you're likely being scammed. Take it to resolution and force the vendor to produce tracking.

    hi everyone, just to say i received the reship package today. The letter had a stamp of 18.03.13 meaning it was posted yesterday, all is good. Not sure whatever happened to the first package.

    BTW is was UK-to-UK, standard delivery in the UK is next day (except sunday)
