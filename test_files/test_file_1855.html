    So it seems like there is a lot of talk on here about how the government doesn't have the budget or time to thoroughly search every package, but a friend of mine suggested to me that there are people operating outside the government that devote their time to catching postal drug dealers. Maybe it's just a rumor going that's around, but freaks me out that there might be some uncle tom out there who is just waiting until they can build up enough evidence to make a case against me. Has anyone else heard something similar or know anyone who has been caught by someone other than the government? It's making me quite paranoid to think about.

    You have to remember a lot of the world believes they would be making the world a better place by riding the world of drugs. People get caught all the time from anonymous tipsters.Â  Neighbors give the police tips all the time about weird neighbor behavior, odd smells, lots of traffic, leaving the house every other day with 50 packages in their car.. And you'd be right if you thought they would call the cops if they found out you were getting drugs in the mail.

    Do these people work for free?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If not who's paying them, if its the government then its a matter of public record.

    Seriously, that's not even possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean, at what point does a 'Watchdog Organization' start monitoring the postal system. How? Without breaking the law themselves?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're talking about watchdog organizations for catching drug dealers, then yes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But drug dealers using the postal system in particular? I don't even see how that could work. Bit of a reach there.
