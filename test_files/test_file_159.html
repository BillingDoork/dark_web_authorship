    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I received a letter with some coke today and in my opinion the letter was the contrary of a secure drug letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was a normal window envelope with 2 sheets paper and the coke ( 1 gr.) in a vacuum sealed foil. Normally this is a good packaging if the product ist flattened but the sealed coke bag was not flat, it was a ball with about 1-1,5 cm. diameter and was in the middle of the envelope. :o Someone told me that its very dangerous with the sorting machines if a letter is very unevenly thick.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do you think about this? I dont know if i should give the seller a good rating. The coke is good but never seen a shit packaging like this (in my opinion).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!
    <br/>

    Message the vendor and express your concerns before you leave feedback.  It may not have been done intentionally, he may offer you a partial refund for not being satisfied (aka to buy your feedback) or be grateful you pointed it out to him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't just leave a vendor bad feedback without talking to them first, that's not fair.

    Im not sure if I want a second letter from this guy. Coke is not a funny thing here at my living place if the police find it. If you have a humorless judge and a previous conviction, you can go to jail a few months if you have bad luck (also for 1 Gr.).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I think I will write him tomorrow with a clean head what I think about his packaging. May be he could make it better in future for other customers. ;)

    I agree with this.  For the most part vendors aren't idiots they don't want your stuff getting caught up anymore than you do.  Talk first, then if you can't reach an agreement go for the feedback.  Unfortunately on SR you're rating the entire service of the vendor, packaging and all.  But still, talk first, then feedback.

    Do you think also that this kind of packaging is absolutely unacceptable? It was domestic but I think its also not really harmless if a letter get shredded by a sorting machine and there crumbles a white powder out of the envelope. :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was really a little bit shocked as I groped the letter and realized that there is a clearly perceptible ball in the middle of this thin envelope. Letter only about 2 mm.,  ball 1-1.5 cm.  :o

    I think the vendor should probably have flattened it out a little, but then again a lot of people like to see their coke rocked up(looks like it just got chipped of a brick).

    I might send him a message explaining your concerns.  He'll probably offer an extra few points in the next order or something.

    Definitely let the vendor know your concerns.  You could help save someone else from a lot of grief.

    That is unacceptable. You should not mail balls of cocaine to people in envelopes. Blister packs is one horrible idea, but cocaine rocks?  :(

    Of course everyone wants to receive their coke as a nice big rock but not in a fucking business mailer, that's the vendor being lazy, careless or both. Send the rock by all means but you need to package it accordingly and use a bubble mailer and other padding to even out the feel.
