    So, I ordered from 2 different vendors from Germany at about the same time, which is 1+ week ago.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Usually Germany-NL takes 2-3 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I called the postal service and they did not see any record of mail being send to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No letter from customs, nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was already looking forward to receiving it last weekend. Now I'm beginning to think it will never arrive. And that I wasted hundreds of dollars :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is nothing I can do, is there?

    Hi man,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i think le makes every few months special operation for 2-3 weeks, where they do control more intensively (like Pangea #6, where they searched mail for illegal pharmaceutics (drugs) 1.-2. week july all eu).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    don´t want to frighten you, maybe it shows up shortly?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But this shit will happen again and again, as long as they have x-ray...

    Would say this too, it ist exactly like the boarder controlls here in the area!(1-2weeks heavy controll after winter holiday and 2-3weeks before summer holiday! shows oure experience!)
    <br/>
    We had never had any prob be pation(the police is mostly less involved than some vendors...workflow whatever...)

    Hi fellow doppers,
    <br/>
    my experience: NL to UK
    <br/>
    I dealt with 2  vendors from NL,- had about 15 order in total with them and with 1 of them it usually takes 2 days, including the day it was put into transit, rarely it would be 3.
    <br/>
    With the 2nd one it's normally 3 days, incl. the day of postage.
    <br/>
    Both send their letters using priority stamps,- one vendor puts 1 onto his letter, the 2nd one sticks 2.
