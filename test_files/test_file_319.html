    I recently ordered some tabs and caps of 25i to the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to the vendor, the DCN says "failed delivery" with a date from more than a week ago. (I haven't actually seen the DCN yet, but the vendor is very reputable so as of now I do not suspect anything fishy.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package should have been fairly small and easily fit in a mailbox, and should not have required a hand delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was addressed to a previous tenant whom I regularly receive mail for.Â  I have not received any sort of notification about the package from the USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What the hell happened to it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seized by USPS? Searched by USPS? Being held indefinitely by USPS?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Forwarded to the actual name on the address, despite the quantity of mail I receive for that person?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Snatched by an unscrupulous mailman who had an idea there might be some goodies inside?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My issue is what to do now. It has someone else's name on it so I can't go to the post office to claim it, and even if my name was on it, I'm not exactly about to go there to pickup blotter paper and caps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone have some advice?

    25i is legal in the US, for now. I don't know what could have happened? But i wouldn't worry too much about it.

    There are many threads on getting shit delivered using other names or the name of previous tenants. Just because some mail arrives in that name doesn't mean all mail will. We recently had a customer's package fail delivery as well and the message for the DCN was 'Moved. No address left.'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use your real name and address... This wouldn't be the vendor's fault. Specially in a case such as this where the thing you are having delivered is legal...

    Sorry forgot to get to the 'advice' part. You could get the DCN from the vendor and call USPS and try to get them to redeliver saying you are the person and the address is correct. If they want you to go in, you wouldn't be able to because it's not in your name...

    Yeah, I'm definitely not shitting bricks or anything, as 25i is legal, my concern is that the blotter looks like LSD and is accompanied by some 'mystery' capsules, which could lead to some unwanted harassment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aidoneus, thanks for the advice on calling and asking for a redeliver, I'll see how it goes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I've seen the DCN now, so all is legit.

    Also, get a fake ID in the fake name you use so if this happens again, you can actually go in and get the box.

    Potentially too similar to 2C-I, from what I understand?

    there is no period of time which you can wait that will prevent their mail from not being delivered if it is something important - especially with a delivery confirmation or tracking, even after the 18 months for mail forwarding it will still be returned to the sender
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is one of the leading causes for mail not being delivered
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just because you receive their junk mail does not mean you will receive more important mail
