    So I posted earlier (a week) ago about a package that was not delivered after two months and tracking was showing it sitting at a sorting facility...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, if I enter the tracking number on the USPS website, I get this message: "Delivery status information is not available for your item via this web site. A return receipt after mailing may be available through your local Post Office. "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I assume that it is an automatic feature, to stop tracking a piece of mail after a certain amount of time, or should I be worried about the police?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    After a certain period of time, USPS deletes the DCN from their website.

    As has been pointed out, the DCN will expire after some amount of time. I am curious though, did the tracking ever show the package actually moving any place or just at the original sorting facility? One of two things are likely, one is that the vendor ordered parcel post online with tracking and never actually sent the package out. Or that it got seized, lost, or stolen.
