    Here's the thing. I ordered some gear from Canada about 8 days ago. I paid a lot for it plus about $60 for 2-3day delivery express option. So thats about $360 in total. Guy had excellent feedback no problems and on here 6 months plus so I ordered. His ad said all international orders must finalize early, and he messaged me to tell me that he needed FE before posting, which I did. Next thing I seen here on the forums there are a few people complaining about cut product and some saying it was 100% cut. Now why would they do that on the forums, surely his feedback would show this? or is it because they are FE? Anyway on his vendor page hes going on about an increasing number of international packages going missing, so must FE. Anyhow he sent me the tracking number. I checked it, and it said "Arrived For Export Processing via ******* depot ", and thatÂ  was the latest info, its been like that for 5 days with no activity. The processing facility is in the same city as where the package originated from. Now I know ive been f**ked, but hows he done it? Is it a fake tracking number or something? It dosent mention the destination or anything on the site. Driving me mad, the vendor isn't replying although he is online defending his product on the forums. Hes now withdrawn the product totally pending testing with EZTest, which he claims not to have and is waiting to get hold of some which he says could take some time. I mean 'come on', who the f**k sends out this shit without testing it! It seems I am doomed anyway but the real question is:
    <br/>
    1) Whats going on with the tracking number -
    <br/>
    2)How has he done it.
    <br/>
    What should i do? Ive already been on the forum telling him to contact me to no avail.

    You ordered heroin via Purolator internationally ?

    Your chances of success were not good even if the seller was straight up.

    No meth... just selected the express delivery option ($60!). I had no idea he was using purolator, I just assumed he knew what he was doing. Should have known when he wanted me to finalize early. Expensive lesson to learn. I suppose its completely pointless trying to get anything back of him,hes refusing to reply. I had no idea meth was so dodgy on here.

    You ordered from MIMM? :-\ Please don't ever finalize early for anyone. SR has Escrow for a reason, so if a dispute between a vendor and yourself can't be resolved, SR Admin. can look at the available evidence and make a fair and equitable decision. The best meth vendor I've come across on SR is Crystall Wife. Hands down the quickest and most professional service I've used on here, really strong and clean meth and they have never asked me to Finalize Early, even though I'm a long way away from where they are. I've received every one of there orders in about a week, which is fantastic in my book. Give them a go, you won't be disappointed. :)
