    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still occasionally receive mail addressed to the previous owner of my house. Would it be a bad idea to use his name instead of my own for shipping when buying from SR?

    i think thats a great idea. the only problem i would have with that is if i'm not in when the parcel arrives, it will be sent to the post office for me to collect... then i wouldnt be able to retrieve it.

    I did this once, package never arrived. Haven't done it since and I've received every package after. I wouldn't do it, and if you do, if it doesn't show i wouldn't ask the vendor for a refund or reship, that shits on you.

    If you're going to do this, definitely send a test envelope first. If the test envelope makes it through alright, then you should be good. If it doesn't, then that means that the mail is still getting forwarded, and it's not safe to use the name for  an order.

    Hope this helps!  :D

    I'd bet the previous tenant received your package because most likely, they filed a "change of address" with the PO.  Seeing mail addressed to previous tenants in your box doesn't mean that person isn't getting their mail forwarded.  That's because not all classes of mail are covered by change of address filings and certain classes are only forwarded for 2 months.  Standard length the PO will forward mail is 12 months.  SO, if the mail your receiving in a previous tenants name is either junk mail or bulk rate or magazines only...don't use it.  If you are getting utility bills or personal correspondence in their name then you should be ok.  It's best though, as Mr California suggested...test it out (I'd add do it a couple times by sending yourself  both First Class and/or Priority mail.)
