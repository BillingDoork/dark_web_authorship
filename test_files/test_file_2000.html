    I'm considering a very large order from Canada into the US. Can anyone comment on how strict customs is going across this border?

    Is it as tough as getting something from the Netherlands?

    Its about your shipper and their methods, not so much customs.

    Canada into the USA is going to be MUCH easier then the Netherlands my man..... I'm a Canadian vendor that only ships within Canada and down to the states and have NEVER lost an order going into the states.....The Netherlands is probably the worst place someone in the US could order from other then some flagged "terrorist" countries maybe.

    It's true, Canada isn't flagged as far as I'm concerned so you're good to go so long as your shipping methods are okay. I've always ordered from Canada with confidence but when I order from the NL I bite my nails off and hope it doesn't get intercepted.

    Hate to break it to you but CA is flagged with US customs. CA is well known for It's mdma production and import routes through the US. It is not as bad as NL but that is mainly due to sheer volume of CA to US mail. Packages are a crap shoot, anything under 30g total weight is pretty safe.

    There are people who ship 1/2 to full kilograms ... it just has to be dont appropriately.

    OP, make sure you are working with a capable shipper whenever your buying off the internet.

    i've never had anything illicit shipped to the US from canada, but i get a lot of regular mail sent from there. every single letter for the past year or so has been opened and resealed with the green "inspected by US customs" tape. i'd say they take the mail inspection pretty seriously.

    inspecting regular mail at that frequency ( assuming your not a total bullshitter ) meanÂ  you have obviously gotten yourself and your address flagged big time. give me a break.

    Mail's a different animal but I've driven across the US/CAN border quite often with a fair amount (personal) of weed on me and never had an issue.Â  If you're flagged however (like getting all you letters opened), it's a whole different ballgame.Â  Had a buddy of mine from Jordan whose name was similar to someone on the wanted list and he couldn't make it across the border without a prostate exam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With SR I wouldn't do that kind of stupid crap anymore (let alone what I one time carried flying back from Mexico).Â  Rather grateful for the road actually.

    i should clarify that i keep a mailbox north of the border, and periodically one of the big couriers will send all of my mail once in one of those big cardboard envelopes. the courier envelope has been inspected by customs and re-taped every time ive done this (probably a dozen times now). none of the letters inside were opened. although i suspect this is more to due with using the private courier doing the remailing instead of canada post/usps. im not sure if canada post has the same obligation as the usps to get a warrant in order to open mail, though i suspect they do.

    I do some business with CA and more then my fair share of packages come in with the inspected tape. Letters, on the other hand, tend to be ok.

    I've had orders of H (gram or under) make it from CAN to US no problem. This box on one side of the border sounds crazy to me. I'd think they'd be on to you by now. Just a thought. With all the surveillance equipment, drones, dashboard cams that read license plates and all. Sounds like risky behavior, but to each their own!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say if you're in the US, a letter coming from the Netherlands, screams "DRUGS", whereas it's very common for mail to go back and forth between US and CAN. If at all possible, I'm sticking with CAN + US Sellers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing against my Dutch friends. Although there are quite a few of you I see that have "ships to anywhere but USA" . So I think there's something there worth thinking about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always read every feedback! Always go on forums and do a search on the sellers name, and read every post ! ! ! - Best advice I can give. - and of course never FE Finalize Early, and never send BTC's directly to seller. (yes I did that once) You can guess the outcome. So I've got the battle scars to speak on this topic.
