    Hey there,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I ordered 1/2 Oz of Cubensis from an upcoming vendor located 1 state away from me. He mentioned that there would be two free samples of nbome for me. I received the package in less than a week as usual for domestic, and the envelope looked handled and kind of worn. No immediate indications of it being opened, but I also wasn't expecting to get what I got.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The entire 1/2 Oz was missing but the nbome was still there. This leads me to believe one of three things:
    <br/>
    1) He scammed me, but wanted it to look like it wasn't his fault.
    <br/>
    2) He actually honestly forgot or made a mistake.
    <br/>
    3) LE confiscated part of my package and sent the rest my way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm currently waiting for a response from the vendor to see what the hell happened. Has anyone had packages arrive like I described?
    <br/>
    <br/>

    1) Probable, talk to him first. If he did though, keep the package and check the weight it had for shipping, cross reference, etc. Prove that he didn't actually send a half oz plus whatever the nbome weighed.
    <br/>
    2) Highly unlikely, but probable. If he's going to remember to put free samples, how would he forget the content you paid for.. It could be a mistake, but then again that's more common for someone selling a LOT OF PRODUCT, I just don't see it if it's an "upcoming vendor"
    <br/>
    3) Impossible. The only reason they would send it to you is if the package required a signature so they could attempt to arrest you, but even then you have deniable plausibility unless they can find proof on your computer.

    So it's looking like he scammed me. I received another package I was expecting with no problems and LE has not showed up to my house or been in the vicinity. He doesn't seem to have a vendor page anymore and isn't responding to my messages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank You for responding though, It definitely put me more at ease.

    His vendor profile doesnt exist anymore and he hasn't actually read the message I sent him days ago. I'm almost positive now that it was a rip off. That being said, I'd much prefer that than LE so I'm happy :)
