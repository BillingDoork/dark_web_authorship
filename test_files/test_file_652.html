    As the self-professed expert on all things USPS, staying on top of the latest goings on with the USPS is my game, and there are lots of changes going into effect tonight at midnight! That's when you say, "...but the Post Office is closed on Sunday!" True, but not the Automated Postal Center. This was mentioned before in a less-conclusive thread, but I thought my more conclusive title would be more eye-catching, especially since other vendors definitely need to see this!

     TL;DR:
     <br/>
     USPS Rates have increased all around—stamps, flat rate postage, etc.
     <br/>
     New tiered pricing for Express/Priority Mail flat rate shipments: domestic/Canada/elsewhere!
     <br/>
     See below for details on all the new Express/Priority Mail tiered rates.
     <br/>
     Delivery Confirmation is now called USPS Tracking.
     <br/>
     Parcel Post is now called Standard Post (and you should continue to avoid it, of course!).
     <br/>
     Priority Mail and Standard Post now include FREE tracking.
     <br/>
     USPS Tracking (previously DCN) can now provide delivery confirmation to Canada destinations!
     <br/>
     USPS First Class can now be tracked without having to print labels online.
     <br/>
    </code>
    <br/>
    Naturally, the rates for just about everything will go up, so don't rely on your previous stamp usage! Of course, forever stamp values increase. The main forever stamp (for 1oz letters) is now 46¢ instead of 45¢. Additional ounces up to 13oz remain only 20¢ extra per ounce as before. Anything beyond 13oz will still need to be shipped via Priority Mail or Standard Post (previously called Parcel Post, though it's definitely not recommended, because it's so slow and often is actually more expensive than Priority Mail, as I've often found to be the case when comparing prices).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Express and Priority Mail flat rate pricing also goes up, but like Express Mail previously, Priority Mail (and Standard Post too) will now include free USPS Tracking (previously called Delivery Confirmation, or DCN on here) without having to put extra stamps on, as long as your parcel is under 13oz, in accordance with the 13 ounce rule, otherwise you have to use the Automated Postal Center or print a Click N Ship label via a USPS Online account. They can even track to Canada now! Awesome!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It also sounds like the old green DCN labels will be done away with, but I'll know more about that on Monday...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's all the juicy info on the new tiered rates for Express and Priority Mail. Information beyond the first 'domestic delivery' tier is still nigh impossible to find online as of late, but I'm supposed to be a ninja, right? My kung-fu is strong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Express and Priority Mail Flat Rate pricing for DOMESTIC delivery will now be as follows:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regular flat rate envelope — $5.60
    <br/>
    Small flat rate box — $5.80
    <br/>
    Medium flat rate box — $12.35
    <br/>
    Large flat rate box — $16.85
    <br/>
    Legal flat rate envelope — $5.75
    <br/>
    Padded flat rate envelope — $5.95
    <br/>
    Express Mail flat rate envelope — $19.95
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Express and Priority Mail Flat Rate pricing for CANADA delivery (now with tracking!) will be as follows:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regular flat rate envelope — $19.95 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Small flat rate box —  $19.95 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Medium flat rate box —  $40.95 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Large flat rate box —  $53.95 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Non-flat rate —  variable, starting at $28.25 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Express Mail flat rate envelope — $34.95 (delivery in 3-5 business days)
    <br/>
    Express Mail non-flat rate — variable, starting at $33.95 (delivery in 3-5 business days)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Express and Priority Mail Flat Rate pricing for delivery to ALL OTHER COUNTRIES will now be as follows:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regular flat rate envelope — $23.95 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Small flat rate box —  $23.95 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Medium flat rate box —  $59.95 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Large flat rate box —  $77.95 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Non-flat rate —  variable, starting at $33.25 (delivery in 6-10 business days)
    <br/>
    Express Mail flat rate envelope — $44.95 (delivery in 3-5 business days)
    <br/>
    Express Mail non-flat rate — variable, starting at $43.00 (delivery in 3-5 business days)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Parcels under 13 ounces can be shipped via USPS First Class, but now have the option of including USPS Tracking. This feature has been offered by labels printed online, but never on stamped or counter-paid postage for First Class mail before. Nifty!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Though I've been around a long time, I've recently decided to try and increase my presence here on the forums more. Feel free to ask any questions about these USPS changes and anything else USPS you may wish to know (as long as you've thoroughly searched for answers to said questions on these forums and elsewhere before asking). :)

    My guess is that the USPS Tracking number format will be the same as the DCN format, because that's what the system and scanners already know, and let's face it, the government has no money to change things up. So, I would assume that the DCN stickers will still be scanned, at least for a while. If they do indeed do away with the lime green sticker, there will still be another sticker for USPS Tracking to replace the lime green DCN stickers, because USPS Tracking is now available as an option for First Class, Standard Post (aka Parcel Post), and Media Mail. So my guess is that those stickers should be used on stamped priority packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll hopefully know more today though. Hang tight!

    Somebody can maybe give me their opinion on this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to this fuckassery of USPS tracking, it seems I cant just grab a tracking slip, slap it on my package, add the postage for it and blue box any longer. My post office says that they need to add the tracking at the counter. If this is 100% accurate, I will not be shipping until another method is found. I guess you can get tracking online, but is this safe is the question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help appreciated.

    Yep, my main man at USPS was still unsure if there would be new tracking labels published for use with stamps, but as of today, the lime green labels were still out but were technically defunct and no longer supposed to be used. He suggested I try the APC and enter in the full amount as the existing postage (since the APC can print custom postage amounts). Well, when I entered the full postage for a flat rate envelope, it balked and gave a message stating, "Heightened security requires that this article be taken to a Post Office counter for acceptance. Do NOT place it in the package mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thus, the USPS has apparently found our Achilles heal, and has struck its first blow. :\
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perhaps DPR or SR staff needs to send out a mass message to all vendors alerting them of this issue so that they don't miss it and accidentally loose a whole bunch of packages? I'm yet unsure if they'd actually scan the now-defunct lime green labels. I was just speculating, or, more accurately, daydreaming out loud. I could be completely wrong though, so I suggest not trying it on a live shipment!

    So any ideas on how to this? Seems like we have 3 options:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Counter, Online, and the automated machines.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    None that I really like. I havent really looked at the options of paying with a prepaid visa online on a fake name registration. Any other ideas?

    Right. Well you can also order the prepaid flat rate envelopes if that's what you typically use to ship stuff in, but again, that requires an online account and a valid address for delivery. I'm sure they would be delivered by the normal postal carrier for that route, but they could potentially be traced back to that address, cc number and online account if something were to go awry with a package sent using them, and could also flag the account altogether, making it slightly more annoying to have to create a new account, obtain a new prepaid cc and finding a new delivery address for the next batch of envelopes. Also, all the other envelopes you get with a single order could potentially be tied together, causing those other envelopes to be flagged as well, if used, potentially costing you the lot of remaining postage-paid envelopes.
    <br/>

    Is that likely? I personally don't think the USPS has enough money to fund such in depth tracking. Evidence shows that even their APCs aren't verifying addresses for credit cards well enough to avoid fraud and chargebacks, which will continue to be the case through March 2014 (again, more details about that are in my stealth guide). But that's not to say it isn't possible. All of the above certainly could be possible. I just don't think it likely is. But again, if your stealth is good enough, you really wouldn't have anything to be concerned about. That's my 3¢ (up a penny from 2¢ as of January 27th). ;)

    I think this makes it pretty easy for a cop to order from a vendor and track down buyers by there address related to the order they placed.

    I think they (priority envelopes) will continue to be. Here is my theory:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. When I perused the USPS.COM and .GOV websites, I could find absolutely nothing about priority envelopes no longer being accepted in blue boxes.
    <br/>
    2. When hyperocity attempted to make a $5.60 prepaid stamp at an APC, he was creating a stamp that was for a letter greater than 12 ounces. I've noticed Postal Workers announce to customers that anything greater than 12 ounces counts as 13 ounces. Therefore, hyperocity's prepaid stamp violates this 13 ounce rule. If anyone has read the 13 ounce warning on a blue box, it will say the reason is because of hightened security. That is also what the APC said, and It could just be repeating this warning.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm going to test this theory when I wake up tomorrow. I've racked my brain hard trying to figure out a way around this BS.

    Not stamped priority packages. Only Click N Ship labeled priority and APC paid priority packages. If at least some postage was paid via the APC, I believe it can still be dropped in the collection bins. I guess they have a sense of security knowing they have your CC number, and possibly a fuzzy-at-best image of you on camera. Also, I don't recommend using Tor for accessing an online account, but don't use your normal connection either. Hit up a local hotspot, or drive around until you find an open one in some neighborhood not near your own house.

    hyperocity, are you saying that priority mail packages that you put stamps on, will NOT be collected and sent if you drop them at a blue mailbox? Are you sure about this? And what about first class mail parcels? And there will be no way of getting tracking if sending prestamped packages? If you have to go to a post office counter to do this business, this is an absolute killer for our SR business ==&gt; no anonymity. How can we get around this?

    Man, I just don't believe the Priority Mail not being accepted if it didn't have metered postage on it. It's not ANYWHERE on the site that this is true. What the fuck is the point of having all these blue boxes that are labeled express and priority then?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is true is that TRACKED priority mail must be done through a potentially ID revealing process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is from the freshly updated USPS.com:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    **IMPORTANT** Retail Priority Mail postage may be paid by adhesive stamps (604.1.0), and postage meter. **IMPORTANT**
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Priority Mail Forever Prepaid Flat Rate packaging must be purchased with a credit card online through www.usps.com. Packages will arrive with shipping labels and Forever Prepaid postage affixed. USPS Tracking/Delivery Confirmation is included at no extra cost. Any additional services must be purchased at a retail Post Office location and applicable extra service fee paid via postage stamps, postage validation imprint (PVI), or postage meter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Commercial base prices are available when postage is paid through Click-N-Ship service or by registered end-users of PC Postage products using a qualifying shipping label managed by the PC Postage system.
    <br/>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What it says is that the "Priority Mail Forever Prepaid Flat Rate" packages must be bought through some shitty way. These are Priority envelopes that you purchase in advance that already have tracking built in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also from USPS.com, and the answer to my question:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Packages with adhesive stamps (13 ounces or less) may be deposited in collection boxes, handed to carriers, or presented at Post Offices. Packages with adhesive stamps (more than 13 ounces) must be presented at a Post Office retail counter. Packages with metered postage or PC Postage may be deposited in collection boxes or at an acceptance point designated by USPS.
    <br/>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, it looks like to be completely professional, one must find a way to get the tracking on there inconspicuously. However, if you're in a pinch, you can still do a non-tracked priority package through the blue boxes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am going to test my theory today.

    ballervision, too bad the above quote doesn't specify priority or first class mail. I suppose if it doesn't, that means it's the same for either. But I can't be sure. I too will try to do some tests. Let's keep this thread going cause it's of UTMOST importance!

    Can anyone verify if it's possible to use a VISA gift card to use the self-service machines inside the Post Office? Before I realized I could slap DCN stickers onto packages and apply the correct postage, I was scouting out the self-service machines as a possibility. I found that if I walked into the post office at the right angle I could avoid my face being captured by the cameras on the walls, and then as I approached the self-service station I could cover the built-in camera with my hand, and get through a transaction, print postage,and leave without giving any cameras a clear shot of my face.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was shocked today as well when I learned DCN stickers will no longer be scanned; the USPS employee told me that if I want my package tracked I must come to the front desk and drop it off. Some post offices aren't equipped with the best camera system (older ones are usually more poorly equipped)...so it is still possible to drop off packages without having your face captured. I still don't want to do it however because it will give LE an exact date, time, and location of where the package originated, which means they would have an extreme advantage in the investigation process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is possible to anonymously use the self-service stations then that is a possibility I think we should consider exploring.

    I checked on this today.  You can still drop off priority boxes (13 oz and under)  with stamps into the blue bins if you do not need it tracked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The green forms are done, and there won't be a replacement.  You either have to go to counter or print online to get the tracking.  There are ways to do it anonymously online i'm sure.

    Can you just print the postage / tracking and drop it and go?  I have yet to sell anything from the road, but I have always done that with other things and never had an issue, and it looks like that hasn't changed.  I realize DCN isn't available anymore, but I would imagine printing off all your postage to PDF (which still has tracking) at a starbucks and printing them off at your house, and dropping off in a box, is pretty safe still.

    According to Visa's gift card website, SS is optional.  I know I have purchased like 5-6 of the things at walgreens and its usually a pretty quick process.  Same thing for activating them.

    Folks, after much searching I found the answers. Take a look below. DCNs (green sticker 152) are still available and usable on first class parcels, but only if you go inside and buy them there. Big no no, cameras, etc. Priority with tracking included is available, but again only if you buy it at the counter or if you buy the flat rate packages online. Again, no good, anonymity is definitely hit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Therefore it looks like from now on, there will be no tracking, no delivery confirmation, if you want to drop off at a mailbox, either first class or priority with adhesive stamps affixed. Unless you're so good at disguising yourself,  and/or so cocky, that you don't mind transacting this business at the counter. I know I'm not!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How this will change things selling on SR is anyone's guess. Anyone have any ideas?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, there's something below about label 400; could this be the famous white slip?

    Yep, and if you're running OSX, there are two great software utilties available that can block any attempt for PDFs to access the web. I don't think USPS labels do, but if you're paranoid, you can install either Hands Off or Little Snitch. Google em. They're great.

    As far as drop and go, yes you can still do online label printing and drop in the blue mailbox and go.

     I think they (priority envelopes) will continue to be. Here is my theory:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. When I perused the USPS.COM and .GOV websites, I could find absolutely nothing about priority envelopes no longer being accepted in blue boxes.
     <br/>
     2. When hyperocity attempted to make a $5.60 prepaid stamp at an APC, he was creating a stamp that was for a letter greater than 12 ounces. I've noticed Postal Workers announce to customers that anything greater than 12 ounces counts as 13 ounces. Therefore, hyperocity's prepaid stamp violates this 13 ounce rule. If anyone has read the 13 ounce warning on a blue box, it will say the reason is because of hightened security. That is also what the APC said, and It could just be repeating this warning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'm going to test this theory when I wake up tomorrow. I've racked my brain hard trying to figure out a way around this BS.

    Your second theory is incorrect. My package was under 13 ounces. It was closer to 5 ounces. Also, the APC exists to circumvent having to take packages greater than 13 ounces to the counter. Otherwise, why would it let you ship packages up to 70 pounds and let you drop them in the bin? Thus, I believe the security factor is their desire to get either your CC number, or your image on camera.

    You can go into the PO and get the new white USPS tracking labels in bulk. Want to guess how I know?
    <br/>
    These labels can be affixed to any priority mail package for no extra free. They provide you with the tracking info you need. They even peel easier then the old green DCN slips!

    Yes, they have an IP address. It's the same as your home internet except your ISP is the cell phone company, and they can obviously track cell phones. If you let it run and used it like a regular internet connection, it would be just as easy to catch you as if you're using regular home internet. You could keep it shut off, drive 50 miles away and turn it on, so if any tracking was done it would only show use in that area. But if you're going to do that you may as well just drive to a mcdonalds or starbucks and use their wifi.

    Ok, so I checked everything and it's a lot less worse than I thought.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1st: All priority packages dropped in blue boxes with appropriate postage get sent. Regular stamps are fine. Metered + Regular are Fine. Just metered is fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2nd: There are multiple POs within my jurisdiction without cameras or without cameras on the lobby where the APC is. To get tracking, use those. There have been no issues whatsoever to get any kind of tracked postage at any value, so I don't know what hyperocity was getting hung up on. The APC has not "balked" at any command I have given it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3rd: Use prepaid gift cards. They work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So it took me a couple days of running all over the city, but everything is honky dory for me. I also saw these tracking slips like farmer said, but I was completely unsure of what they were and their use. They are exactly like DCNs except white, and they are available in the PO in stacks, and these are also what print out of 3rd party APCs for tracking. Haven't used them yet though.

      What about a Mi-Fi devise you can buy them with no contract at walmart just pay cash and you can get a pre-paid card to go with it and thats it  ur online with a fake account. The speed is not bad either and i can go anywhere to do business cheap rent by the week motels etc etc.

      I dont think they can track the ip to a mobile devise??????????????? Can they  or better yet would they

     Yes, they have an IP address. It's the same as your home internet except your ISP is the cell phone company, and they can obviously track cell phones. If you let it run and used it like a regular internet connection, it would be just as easy to catch you as if you're using regular home internet. You could keep it shut off, drive 50 miles away and turn it on, so if any tracking was done it would only show use in that area. But if you're going to do that you may as well just drive to a mcdonalds or starbucks and use their wifi.

    its a shared ip address on a data line :-[ it is not impossible  :-\to trace but it is no way as easy as a cell phone you just have to buy a new one  every month
    <br/>
    <br/>
    X-old lady's brother works as a IT tech for one of the 4 large cell Phones providers and he told me there not that easy to track even for the service provider cell phones yes but this is a bit more complexed to track.

    Do you have to register the prepaid gift cards?   Can they be used online at usps website to print postage?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are you sure those labels were the new ones?  Their 'insurance' labels are white and look similar to the new tracking labels.  I couldn't find them yet, and the counter people wouldn't give out theirs.

    I think 420SLINGER is LE.  His username implies he sells.  He's NOT a vendor.  He's asking for information about how we're going to circumvent LE's 'new and improved security'.  DON'T FORGET TO LOOK AT HIS KARMA(had to put that in caps since it did[cause it's a dumbass and hasn't figured out the 'quote' function])!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One way or another, if I knew something like this I'd think long and hard before sharing it.  Kind of like with laundering money, It's best if EVERYONE doesn't know the specifics of how you do it. ;)

    The dcn is included in the flat rate price so you dont have to pay for it. You are able to order them and I dont think you need to give them correct information. Just a place for them to land.  Is getting a dcn to use going to be like getting product?

    I just checked on a first class package i sent out on 1-31 using stamps and the green 152 dcn dropped into a blue box. Tracking worked fine and showed it had been delivered.

    I think some clerks were confused and thats where the wrong info came from. I also sent out a priority package with green dcn and stamps. I haven't checked on it yet but i will.

    Can you use prepaid anon gift cards at the online usps site that you get from cvs or wallmart? I tried to do it once and they would only take regular credit cards. Anybody been able to make it work?

     You can go into the PO and get the new white USPS tracking labels in bulk. Want to guess how I know?
     <br/>
     These labels can be affixed to any priority mail package for no extra free. They provide you with the tracking info you need. They even peel easier then the old green DCN slips!

    Did you get them over the counter or at the little help-yourself stand? I have checked a few POs in my neck of the woods and none of them have white tracking labels, in fact one of them even still had the green DCNs out! When I asked a clerk if she had stickers to give me she insisted that in order to track a package I had to present the package at the counter and they entered all the information in the computer, "no more stickers" were her exact words.

    I tried to get the white stickers today and was denied by a trainee postal worker. I could see a short stack with 2 per page next to him and I think there was a roll of them behind him as well. I had already annoyed him by asking for stamps to mail 10 small priority boxes, 7 medium boxes and 5 large. He was sure I would have to bring my packages to the desk to get them tracking. I think he was mistaken and will be trying more post offices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They did not like my buying stamps for Priority boxes and suggested I would have trouble if I tried to use the Blue box drops. Maybe they were sure my packages would be over 12 ounces or whatever? I am sure the blue box drops will work if the Hole is big enough. Need to check on that still (for the bigger boxes). Anyway, main lesson I learned, is to know what stamps I want to buy. Don't make them figure it out so they wonder why you would need so many for priority boxes. Just tell them you need 25 $5 stamps, 20 $2, 22 20c stamps,...

    PO workers can suck sometimes. I don't know why there are inconsistencies. I suspect the labels are still in short supply but will flow more freely with time. All we can do is keep sharing our experiences and solutions as we navigate this new territory.

    Halfway down in the page is a picture of the new labels.  I checked with USPS and they are backordered.  They said you can wait til they come in and order them via phone, or preorder and they will ship to you when they come in.  I believe they come in packs of 50.

    If you can't do it online, and you must have tracking, your best bet is to prestamp your packs and drop them off at post office.  They will put the label 400 on and give you the little sticker that has the number for you to keep.

    Thank you for the information! I went to four post offices today, including one in another county, and none of them had the elusive white tracking slips out on the counter and all the clerks refused to give them out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My next question is vital for everyone:
    <br/>
    When you bring a pre-stamped, pre-labeled package to the window for a tracking slip, do they SCAN the slip at that very moment or put any information in the computer? Or do they simply slap the sticker on the box and hand you the receipt stub?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they simply slap the sticker on and throw the box in a pile, then there is hope for us. If they do any sort of electronic action at the same time they attach the sticker, then it still isn't worthwhile.

    No problem.  If it's a small subsidized PO (like at a grocery store, etc), and not the actual PO building, they will slap a sticker on it, postmark it, and give you the little sticker withe the number on it from the main label.  They can't scan it at most of them.  USPS will scan them when they pick them up from that grocery store, etc.  There is no time stamp when you actually drop off so its somewhat safer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The actual PO will probably print a barcode label from the machine.  I know they do when you buy the postage there, and i'm guessing they will when you bring one in prestamped as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try a smaller PO for a quick drop off.   I"m guessing it is fine to preorder the labels by calling usps and getting them delivered to a safe drop not tied to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All will be fine soon when the labels are back in stock and can be ordered.

    The new 400 white tracking labels are to be ordered by interested parties online, UNLESS you find a friendly and helpful postal employee who will give you some or even a whole roll over the counter, "anonymously". Needless to say, ordering the labels online kills your anonymity right there, cause the labels can be linked by their tracking numbers directly to you and your address. Unless you figure out a way to have them sent to some hidden drop location that can't be linked to you.

     <br/>
     The actual PO will probably print a barcode label from the machine.  I know they do when you buy the postage there, and i'm guessing they will when you bring one in prestamped as well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Try a smaller PO for a quick drop off.   I"m guessing it is fine to preorder the labels by calling usps and getting them delivered to a safe drop not tied to you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     All will be fine soon when the labels are back in stock and can be ordered.

    In my area there are "USPS Approved" independently owned shops that look like knockoff Post Offices on the inside that offer all the same services as a post office. I guess I'll try dropping a clean package at one and seeing what they do. If all is well then I'll be back in business.

    I've made some crude calculations of how many 400 self-stick tracking labels there are in a roll; the only weak point in this is that I don't have a caliper to measure the thickness of the label and paper substrate. I didn't feel like unrolling the roll to count them up, as I prefer not to handle these types of things more than once (when shipping, and then with appropriate gloves of course).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But using a fabric loupe I counted about 20 levels of wound paper and labels per 1/8 of an inch of the roll thickness which comes to about 0.16 mm per label.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Each label plus twice half the gap between labels comes to 23.8 mm. Using standard math for this (look it up) I got 206 labels per roll. Using an online calculator I found, I got an extremely close match.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously, 200-odd labels is not much at all, especially for vendors who sell a LOT. I do hope that it will get progressively easier to obtain rolls of these babies, cause if not, it will pose a big obstacle to our desire to send packages with tracking, to avoid unpleasantness down the road (no pun intended).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I made some blunders here, I admit it. The labels are 79.4 mm in length, not 23.8 mm. This gives a minuscule 55 labels per roll. This seems too little, frankly. I don't know where the mistake is, but I followed the accepted math formula for the length of a roll of paper knowing the outside diameter, inner diameter (that of the core or hole) and the thickness of the paper. I couldn't be too far off on the thickness, as I counted some 18 to 20 thicknesses per 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).
    <br/>

    Anybody out there want to take a crack at this?

    I will definitely post my results from my trial run this week here on the forum.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was my alternative shipping method that I didn't want to post publicly since it isn't as perfect as dropping a package at a blue mailbox whenever and where-ever you want. My alternative is still much better than going up to a counter and dropping a package, but nothing will ever be as anonymous as what we had before. Therefore, since it's no secret that LE is all over these forums, I would prefer to keep that method private if I have to use it.

    Just wanted to update with my experience, today I shipped out a package.  It was a priority box, paid for with stamps according to the usps postage calculator, although I actually paid about 40 cents more because of the stamps I had), and I attached one of the old style green DCN stickers.  Right now it is showing as scanned into the system, just like they used to be.
    <br/>
    This is just an observation, I'm not saying this is how it will be forever, just something interesting.

    TRacking is fucked up big time ATM.....Even with this new tracking.. I had something sent friday from west coast..I got it Saturday which was amazing.BTW IM East coast and they tracking never said it was delivered til today ..lol..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This happen with a international pack too, it said it was attempted to be deliverd on a certain day which i knew was a lie cause i spoke to my mail lady that day, so it said it was at my  P O .Since t was just a sum of cash i called to tell them my tracking said they tried to deliver but that was untrue and no slip was left. Of course they told me to call bak cause the mail truck just arrived,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and i had to SLOWLY SAY my track says it is at your  P O. The denied having it..  I call back and she asked my address says just letter, i said ITS A INTERNATIONAL EXPRESS PACKAGE LADY!!  she then again acts ignorant like certain ppl do and comes back and said 'Ok we have it it just came in on todays truck'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my point is since they have switch tracking to me its been FUKED UP!!!!   The DCN WORKED bettter IMO..Unless they just have to tweak issues the new track SUCKS!

    Figured it out finally. I had made a significant digit mistake; instead of the length of the roll coming to around 4,400 mm, it turns out it's 44,000 mm or 44 meters, so the number of labels in a roll is around 550.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's a lot better. If one can obtain a roll of these 400 usps tracking label, it will last a good many shipments.

    Sorry to be so obsessive about this thing, it was just preying on my mind...

    I hear the USPS is having issues atm due to employee unrest. Probably for good reason.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was able to get some of the white labels from a Roll. My current theory is that the rolls have the little strips u keep so u know your tracking number. I also think there are pads with 2 labels per page that don't have the extra strips. I think postal workers use the pads mostly as they scan the stickers into the computer and don't need the little strips. So, I don't think the postal workers need the rolls and should be willing to part with them once they realize this.  NWN

    That would be all well and good if the USPS wasnt a big fucking bureaucracy with its head up its ass. Everyone you ask will give a different answer about this. I was just there today and i asked the clerk if they still had the green dcn labels (she had a big stack of em in her drawer), she said no. I asked how am i supposed to do tracking and she told me you get tracking when you take your packages to the counter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So unless you steal the fucking things or bribe them to give em over, you either have to take your package to the counter, order em online, or find a post center without cameras.

    Of course! What makes twolips think that the owner or occupant didn't put in a change of address in anyway? And if it is definitely an empty house, like for rent or sale, PO would not deliver anything there, it's all registered as no one lives there.

       I mention before that you can use a prepaid phone and order the stamps to a house that is vacant. Will that not work for most of you?

      IMO vacant house is a terrible idea, postman is gonna know somethings up.

    If you use the name of a recent tenent it will likely be forwarded to them at their new place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you make up a name, you might get lucky and have the mailman think it could be correct.
    <br/>
    It is risky though. Best to give the mailman some practice on some practice mailings with the name before you send anything important. If there is a piece of paper inside the box with names written on it to let the mailman know what names are ok (mailman cheat-sheet) you might add a name to it?

    Maybe, but that's the last person I would ask to be involved in this. They would have so much to lose, why would they let me mail drugs to their property?

    I think we were talking about tracking labels, not drugs.

    I am reposting this in various tracking label threads in case it is true - sorry to be repetitive.-
    <br/>
    I was told recently that the Free tracking on priority mail is only if you buy the postage online or take the package to the counter. She claimed that even if you have the "400 labels" you have to pay $0.90 more postage for tracking if you drop in a blue box with stamps. I'm not even sure she was saying you could add the extra postage as stamps? I don't trust this information although she seemed to think she was an expert on the subject. She gave me a bunch of different bar code labels she said did not add tracking (even though they say "USPS Tracking #" in bold print) but would keep the package moving through their system faster. These labels are not #400 and do not have the little extra strip on the bottom with a copy of the tracking number to keep.
