    Hey I'm about to receive a package, hopefully, anyways i had a question. Assuming it gets delivered when i expect it, and I'm home, should i answer when the delivery guy knocks. Ideally I would not, and he would leave it at the door (if it doesn't fit in the mailbox). I'm worried if I do answer he'll ask me to sign then what do I do. I don't want to sign for anything. Please help.

    relax and breathe, if you did everything( leading up to delivery) right and safe, you should be fine. The mailman delivers mail every single day, he wont think twice about another identical envelope(assuming you didnt order pounds of pot)

    No need to freak out. The delivery guy shouldn't knock and ask for signature unless it was shipped with a service that requires it (no vendor does that), or the parcel is very large.

    I've received over 30 illicit small packages in the mail this year, not once has the USPS man ever knocked. He just leaves it in the mailbox, as he does with any little parcel that was shipped. He has no reason to suspect anything, it is one of the hundreds of mail items he handles a day. He himself doesn't inspect or give a shit. The chances of them attempting a controlled delivery for a first time, personal amount shipment of drugs is ridiculously small.
