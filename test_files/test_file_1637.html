    <br/>

    Great idea if you want your mailman to assume someone wrote the address wrong and deliver your drugs to that neighbor instead.

    Of course there are different opinions on this. But you must ask yourself what would be the purpose of doing this? Wrongly spelled addresses/names are probably gaining more (bad) attention than if you would use your real name. Everyone could send you a mail containing drugs using your real name, so if customs should find a package containing illicit stuff addressed to your real name it does not proof anything. Never say you did order a package and keep your house empty of illicit drugs when the package is in transit would be my advise if you need to ship to your home address.
