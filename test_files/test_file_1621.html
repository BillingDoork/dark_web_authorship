    Australia is a country with most strict customs in the world and Holland is a red-flaged country to ship from.
    <br/>
    Don't you think it's deadly combination and still hope that all of Your packages will arrive?

    Order domestically, or finally from less suspicious country...

    yes i know this already, the reason i thought i'd give him a go is the positive feedback from ozzies that say yes he is good, not having a cry just what to hear from fellow country men on how long a package from him can take, so i'll say again if not from Australia i'm not really interested in what you have to say

    Which Aussie's have said he is good? Most say FM is a selective scammer, your package probably won't show up and you won't get a refund either if you FE'D either.

    Drug prices in Aus are ridiculous, I don't blame any Aussies for trying to order internationally even though their customs is probably the toughest on the planet. Good luck man, hope it tuns up for you.

    FM ripped off Miss Sexy Boots when she first started out on SR approx. $8000 if I remember correctly (could be wrong but I know it was around the $8000 mark). All packages from NL faces extra scrutiny through Customs. NL is a known world wide drug hot-spot by Custom Services everywhere and has been for many years now. While some packages may arrive, the majority of them don't. O/S orders can take up to 30 days on occasions but I wouldn't be pinning my hopes on your order arriving because it probably won't.  :(
    <br/>
    If you FE, you're basically screwed and must rely on FM coughing up a refund of some sort. Good luck with that. If you're in Escrow, you'll have to be patient and request a refund % (1 - 100%) through the RC. I would avoid ordering from NL like the plague if I was you.  :(
    <br/>
    Our Customs is no tougher than other countries such as the UK or the US. It's a simple matter of a vendor knowing what's required to stealthily package and disguise your order. Speaking from experience, it can be done successfully if you have a vendor with the knowledge and skills to do so.

    I received a letter with 10g of MDMA from FM in about 10 business days to Aus. I won't ever use him again as you have to FE and his stealth isn't up to scratch. You're much better off using a vendor like Symbiosis who has excellent stealth and ships from the UK, not a flagged nation like Holland.

    No offence, but it's you that's full of shit. I've experienced the issue of shipping and red flags myself. Your kidding yourself if you actually believe NL isn't a world wide known drug hot-spot by Customs Services all over the world. I see your SO confident of shipping to Australia that if a package goes missing, the buyer gets NO REFUND OR RESHIP. In fact, reading further down your profile page, you have now written the following -

    That's reassuring to hear from a vendor selling products from the country in question! It's not hearsay at all mate, it's based on real life experience. Anyone with a shred of intelligence can deduce from your profile page that you actually agree with what I've said wholeheartedly! The facts are the facts. If you're confident of products getting through to Australia from NL, because they (according to you) don't face tougher scrutiny, then start shipping to Oz. However, you've already figured that out champ, haven't you?? The only shit here mate is what's been posted by you. I find the contradiction between your vending profile and what you posted here the funniest thing of all.  ??? ???

    This thread has made me worry sooo much more than I already was. I have an order of speed(only a gram) and an order of 10 biccies. Biccies coming from Germany and Speed coming from NL. I also have a package from the UK but im fairly confident about that one judging by the vendor FB his stealth is really something else...I just got my fingers crossed on the GER and NL! I was thinking about getting from FM's but I decided against it for some reason...He has that many orders it wouldnt matter 2 fucks to just not send it and say "it got lost. Your in Oz. Better luck next time." Just had a funny feeling...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep us updated on your order from FM's :) Good Luck mate...I hope you get it!

     That's reassuring to hear from a vendor selling products from the country in question! It's not hearsay at all mate, it's based on real life experience. Anyone with a shred of intelligence can deduce from your profile page that you actually agree with what I've said wholeheartedly! The facts are the facts. If you're confident of products getting through to Australia from NL, because they (according to you) don't face tougher scrutiny, then start shipping to Oz. However, you've already figured that out champ, haven't you?? The only shit here mate is what's been posted by you. I find the contradiction between your vending profile and what you posted here the funniest thing of all.  ??? ???

     Don't stress about the amount of time it may take, just try and be patient. Recently I ordered some Coke from a UK vendor and then 5 days later ordered some MDMA from the same vendor. The MDMA beat the coke to the same address by 3 days. Weird shit happens with the mail!

    I have never ordered from Frank Matthews but I from reading reviews on here and from people I know IRL who have used him the reviews are very mixed. Generally it seems the product is good but delivery doesn't always come. I think what you have is a combination of coming from a hotspot country and one of the biggest dealers on the road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For what it's worth I have only ever had one delivery from the NL not make it. I didn't bother pursuing. It was ~$50 (2 grams MDMA) and I just wrote it off. I do feel like I shouldn't just give it a free pass like that because it just gives ammo for some dealers to not do the right thing. Most do the right thing and there are so many things that could go wrong - 1) did customer encrypt his address correctly? 2) if there are multiple people using a vendor account was there a miscommunication and they believe someone else in their syndicate sent out the order. 3) did the vendor send it? 4) did it get through customs? 5) did the post man put it in the right letter box (had a letter addressed to a neighbour from down the road in my mailbox last week)...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any of those go wrong and you don't get your gear, and it's pretty much impossible to determine what step failed (and there are other points of failure as well).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course there are a minority which are happy to selectively scam. That's just the nature of the beast and it's no different to the game IRL. The biggest issue for mine when not getting your gear is not knowing what to do with your drop. I have never gone above $200-$300 for O/S orders, so the money isn't an issue but given I only have limited amounts of drops, that is where it gets sketchy for me. My experiences of getting into Australia over the last 15 months I have only had 3 of about 15 orders not make it, another of which i am almost certain I encrypted the wrong address as I was very drunk when i ordered (lesson learnt) so I just gave them the ~$50 worth of bitcoins.

    FrankMatthews is known for scamming Australians.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you finalized early it's not coming, sorry. He has that many orders that your 1/5 is just a drop in the ocean that doesn't effect him at all, and he has nothing to gain from sending you any product as with the scale that he is selling repeat business of small Aussie orders doesn't mean shit to him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd stay away from the Netherlands personally. I order a shitload of Ebay items and every single one that has come from the Netherlands has arrived with an 'opened and inspected by customs' sticker.

    Are you sure SR haven't suspended his account? If you've FE, then you're fucked but if his account has been closed by SR and your coins are still in Escrow, you'll get them back (minus the 4% hedging fee if the listing was hedged).

    My first order was 28g of molly from "Symbiosis" to Australia. his steal is actually amazing and the product is just mdmazing! comes in 2 packages, 14g each (im still waiting for the 2nd one, ive talked to vendor and its nothing to do with customs).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When his mdma listings go back up, i highly suggest purchasing!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On another note, Ive ordered 25g of molly from "HappyTimezz" today for a trial run with the vendor. if all goes smooth ill be buying larger amounts. ill be writing my experiences with the products in the vendors review threads when i receive them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for cola, Ive only ever ordered once (domestic), it came with a sticker which says "1g of cocaine" which is now on my fridge. the quality wasn't that great and the price was too high. but what do you expect from Australian products.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    hope this helped :)

    +1 Joy.Raptar for some good advice. Too many people are discussing details which should not be made public. Mentioning you are waiting for or have ordered 5g or 14g from a vendor is something that should be kept to PM's only. As J.R stated, details can lead to LE establishing a connection. There is absolutely no need to take such a risk. Minimize your risks by keeping the details to yourself or if you must discuss them, use PM's. :)

    mother of god I want my MDMA... I keep trying to trick myself that FM didn't scam me, but I'm sure he did. My order was marked in transit after about 30 seconds and then I got a PM asking to FE. I told him no, I wont be FE because he is apparently a selective scammer and I didn't want to lose my money... No reply but my order is still in transit...

    Why would you take the risk if you knew he was a selective scam artist?

    I was wondering the very same thing and if you did pm FM saying that you guaranteed your order was not going to be sent. I can think of better ways to decline an FE request that would not burn any bridges between you and the vendor.
