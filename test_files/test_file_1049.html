    Hey guys, I ordered a package last fri.  than all that crazy ddos shit happened, couldnt get on, thought dude would ship on mon. but never came yesterday.   I pm'd him and asked exactly when he sent it cause every single order i have ever got, made it in the 3 days that priority guarantees.  When he responded, he said he put in drop box monday night, so must've been sent tues.  OK so then Fri. (today) would be the 3rd day...still nothing....Just want to know, should i be worried?  I know the procedure for recieving packages and everything, but it has never taken this long... I wish that if he didnt send it out on mon, or tues, that he would just tell me so i would not have to worry.  So I guess what i am asking is Do your guys packages ever come later than day 3 or 4, priority?       Thanks for all your responses guys!

    Ohhh and by the way, this is US domestic!

    Could you be more specific? Are you talking about domestic or international shipping? US or Europe? Or elsewhere?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In Europe MayDay is a public holiday in most of the countries, so you should put that into the equation if you are talking about Europe.

    In US for USPS expect a maximum of 5 days for priority, from most places. In extreme situations it can take longer. Some postal areas are slower, and in general some times of the day/week are slower. I've seen 3 days from west-east coast, but 6 days from midwest-east.

    In EVERY situation where I paniced about it not being "on time" (except 1 where there was a mixup), it came shortly after.  It's not an exact science, depends what part of the day it was dropped off, how busy the carriers are etc.  Just breathe, wait a few more days, and you'll probably get it and feel silly for stressing on it, I always do.

    In my experience it fluctuates a lot, I would not get worried for at least two more days (Monday post).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hard not to worry though but honestly, too soon.

    Priority isn't what it used to be, but it still should arrive in 3 days. I've had them take longer. I agree with the consensus here. If not tomorrow ( last year for Saturday mail delivery in US)  Than definitely Monday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What irks me is vendors who offer Priority Mail, and then don't put it in the mail for two days. - Really it should be in the mail THAT day, if before, say 3pm their local time. Some Vendors actually will state on their site, a certain cutoff time for orders to go out same day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The ones that mail it 2-3 days from date of order placed, should only charge Flat Rate, or give you extra product for the trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean, they're charging for Priority. Yet they don't make it one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll  never go back to a Vendor who's done that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been on this road, longer than you think!

    Just stay cool for a little bit, i hope it arrives tomorrow for you, but the vendor could have lied when he really sent it, Its happen to me a few times, and its very annoying , It causes the exact reaction your having now, but iv always revieved my priority mail from WEST to LowerEast On the 3rd mailing day, Normally never longer, but as someone pointed out it can take up to 5 days im pretty sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just chill for the Moment.. Is this the first time working with this vendor and does he have a good review record of shipping time etc?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do your homework on vendors bro is some advice i can offer, always check up on them and read about them in the forums if its possible their menton in here, if their not then they r new or not making any heads spin.. lol  :D

    I wouldn't be worried.  With all the downtime the vendor probably shipped it later than he said.  A few days late in the mail is nothing.  It will come next week, and you'll be happy.  You're probably and most likely worrying for nothing.

    USPS definitely isn't as efficient as we would all love to believe. Though with the downtime most vendors have been forced to get their packages out later than normal but with USPS there literally is no telling. Its rare but we have had packages dropped off at boxes take long simply because the worker wasn't stopping to pick up from every box on his route. So many variables are involved sometimes with shipping. Hopefully you used some one trustworthy with excellent stealth, that always takes the edge off of some stress.
