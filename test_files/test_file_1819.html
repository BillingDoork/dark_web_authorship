    Vendors will usually advise on their seller page how much you will be refunded if it is intercepted. I think 50/50 loss is reasonable.

    Have you read your seller's page? Does he/she mention anything about refunds/seizures? I know some vendors offer refunds/re-ships in these situations..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would assume that you would need to send them proof of the seizure (i.e a picture/scan of the letter). They may offer a partial refund or something.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would wait to hear back from your vendor before doing anything, but that's just my 2 cents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Out of curiosity, what country are you in, and what did you purchase?

    I know that a lot of vendors like to say that "once the package is out of [their] hands and into the hands of the postal service, there's nothing that [they] can do. [They] did [their] part by shipping your package, so [they] deserve to be paid the full amount, even if your package gets seized."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the most part, this is true. However, I take partial issue with that method of thinking because there *is* more that a vendor can do - make *SURE* that their packages aren't going to get seized in the first place. 75% of the time, a package gets seized solely based on the poor packaging skills of the sender.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your package got seized and your vendor doesn't want to offer you *any* reimbursement because they sent your package out and you have proof that it was seized, take the matter to resolution. Don't take a 0% refund without a fight if you invested a good bit of money in the order. Use the 'resolve' function, and request a partial refund, and cite poor packaging as a possible reason for the seizure. You'll probably get some kind of reimbursement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, you should always try to politely work it out with your vendor first. If your vendor offers you some kind of compensation for the seized package, take it into serious consideration. If you feel that the resolution proposed by the vendor is inadequate, counter their offer with what you think is fair (for you *and* them). If you can't reach your own resolution, a Silk Road admin will reach one for you; just be sure to state your point clearly and thoroughly. Let them know in the 'resolve' function that you believe that the package was seized due to lackluster packaging skills and you don't want to be out a shit load of money because of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your order wasn't very expensive though, just let it go and move on. Personally, I wouldn't take anything under $50 to resolution (unless I had a good reason).

    This is sound advice.  Keep in mind that a high refund rate has a negative impact on your buyer stats.  For small amounts, I'd just write it off if I couldn't work it out with the vendor.  Regardless, your first course of action should be what you've already done- try to work it out with the vendor.

    So, how did you get this number 75% .  Those vendor who do not pack well will never stay in this biz for long. No one vendor want his mail been sized, first - not good for business, second - letter from Border protection coming to his post office with fake return address, creating alarm in local LE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    according to data published by customs 90% of contraband sized because of prior intel received by custom.

     Do you have a reference for that? That's very interesting if it's true. What kind of intel I wonder? If that's true there's alot to be said about ordering from more low profile vendors as customs are less likely to have any intel on smaller vendors.

    Unfortunately this is the risk you take when making international orders, you have to accept that sometimes your order will be confiscated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the vendor offers some kind of refund, then obviously take it but as far as I am concerned I wouldn't expect any kind of refund.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its your choice to order internationally and the vendor fulfilled his obligation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I don't order internationally to avoid this.  This means I cant get some of the bargains available abroad. Thats just the way it is.

    So if a seller could find a way to make each package different, so no package customs receive from a vendor can help them identify any other packages from that vendor, then theoretically, interception by customs would drop 90%? :S

    Arent packages routinely inspected for tax purposes? i.e. they want to see whats inside so they can figure out if you owe the government any additional import duty.
