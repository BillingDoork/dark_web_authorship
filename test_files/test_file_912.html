    I'm getting ready to place my first order from sr and was reading about packages not showing up which got me thinking. Last year (month isn't important obviously) i ordered some supplements and they never showed up. The tracking number showed as being delivered but i never received them. I opened a claim with the post office (usps) and was pretty much given the run around for a solid week and a half first i called the 800 number and they opened the claim and said they will ''investigate'' but told me to call the office i did so but it was always busy, and even when i got through the post master took my info and said he'd call me back in a day or two, no call of course so i tried to call a few more time for a couple days and the line again always busy. I go to the post office and the post master wasn't there. So i took the 50 bucks loss and forgot about it.. I have moved since then but with me getting ready to place my first order i started to wonder was that a lost package or was it something more to those supplements never showing up. What do you guys think?

    Thanks

    You are good to go.Â  I highly doubt your supplements were confiscated and if you have changed addresses you are golden.
