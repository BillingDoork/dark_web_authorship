    When ordering small amounts I believe it is safer to order them to your own house (if your house is clean). Why? Deniability. You can deny a package coming to your front door, say you didn't order it, you have no idea where it's from. If you go to a drop box then you are specifically going to pick up a package. No denying that. Unless you order some cheap ebay item and hope it arrives at the same time, (or post something yourself.)
    <br/>
    However I think for large orders it's maybe worth the risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts anyone?

    I don't think it any different because if i owned a drop box i would still go and check it weather i ordered something or not! People could also send something to a drop box without you ordering it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The main advantage with a drop box is that you can open it with fake documents meaning that it wouldn't get link back to you! Also is a lot harder for them to do a CD at a drop box!

     ^ yes, the advantage of a drop is fake docs and you can let it sit there as long as you want. some places even offer 24 hour access. No brainer imo, for bulk. if I was ordering personal amounts I'd do it to my home.

    If shit goes bad your just adding a felony to the charges with the fake docs. Really the only reason to use a drop box or PMB is if were you stay you need to hide it from the ppl that live there. Other option is to pay someone to open the box for you.. someone you don't know.
