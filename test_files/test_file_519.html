    Hey guys. I'm a first time user of silk road. I've never made an order or anything. I'm still in disbelief by the blatant awesomeness of this environment. It's very easy for people like me to forget about the possible implications of making an order here. Either way, I suppose that's why I haven't ordered. I'm making this thread because I wanted to get some information from experienced Silk Road users, not random people on the internet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Apparently, in Texas, possession of MDMA is a pretty serious fucking crime. I have no idea why. It's a state jail felony to possess less than a gram which is a mandatory six months in a state jail. I have never tried MDMA before, but I really want to. I've smoked cannabis for God knows how long now... I want something new! But I'm pretty scared of my package being intercepted and a controlled delivery being performed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in a really upscale area. Homes in my area range from $500,000 - $1,000,000. There's never anyone out here, so I can definitely know if something is wrong. I know not to sign for packages, I know not to accept delivery if the mailman comes to try to get me to sign etc. etc. I've seen conflicting reports about where to order the item to and what name to use, but my gut is telling me that the best thing to do is order to my own home address using my own name. Some people seem to think that's stupid, others seem to think it's hiding in plain sight. I fall in with the latter group.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I only want to order two. I want just two MDMA pills so I can just test the waters and have a good time. I don't want to make ordering from Silk Road something I do on a consistent basis. I would think items like cannabis were more likely to be detected by K-9 units, but apparently they can sniff out MDMA too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know that I should be ordering from a reputable dealer, but my main concern is what's in the package. Are most packages sent with an item inside that helps conceal what the package is actually for? Like a small toy, a card, a box, anything? Or are they mostly empty packages with really well hidden contents? It seems like the latter would be really stupid and cause red flags, but I suppose anything is possible when dealing with people on the internet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does it seem like a safe bet to order two pills (at the fastest shipping speed I can find) to a Nazi state like Texas, or am I better off trying to find my own supply on the street?

    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry your state sucks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Generally domestic packages don't have decoy material in them, it's overkill.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good vendors that package things decently, meaning sealed, shipped shoryly after, packaged in a clean room, and so on generally have interception rates of less than 2%, and that also accounts for packages that are simply lost or "lost".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When your package arrives take it inside and let it sit for a day or so. Write "return to sender" on it if it maskes you happy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have a clean house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While there is a very small risk, if you pick a reputible vendor and take proper precautions yourself, you will very likely be fine.

    the USPS handles millions of packages, every single day. there is never a guarantee when ordering anything on this site, ever. in fact, every decision we make on here is nothing more than a mere calculated risk. their money, time, and resources to confiscate, investigate, and prosecute you based on a personal amount of drugs coming to your home ($40 street value, in your case) vs. your one inconspicuous package in a sea of millions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if i were you, i'd lurk a lot more and do much more reading. whilst you panic about ordering a few pills, somebody here today will probably finalize on an ounce of cocaine or something. ;) stay safe.

    tejas does suck a big one when it comes to drug laws. order domestic from a reputable vendor and research your pills, there are some sr vendors selling presses that are similar to mdma, but not mdma. also screw ordering 2, you are going to like it. it does live up to its name aand it has so many benifits. if something were to go wrong it sounds like your folks have the juice to keep you out of huntsville. Get a good domestic vendor that has been around with a few hundred transactions and all will be golden. Good luck

    It is extremely unlikely that LE would do a controlled delivery for 2 MDMA pills. They have limited resources.

    i don't think anybody should ever underestimate the capabilities of an adversary. this leads to a false sense of security, lack of motivation to stay ahead, or perhaps set an inadequate standard of security. never assume your setup or measures are "overkill", go the extra mile for your freedom. this is something that i see being a big problem for the community of SR, when convenience takes over people's better judgment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    who cares if he's a doctor or someone important? the laws don't just suddenly stop applying. sure, theres room for corruption if he was in a state of high power where he's at. however, something about the way he presented himself on this thread doesn't convice me he's of that sort of status.  ;D

    Thanks for the fast replies, everyone. I think I have the gist of how this all works. I understand there's never a guarantee and, unfortunately, anything is possible. I've heard some horror stories about people in my state being busted for single marijuana seeds and given overly harsh punishments (to the point of being flat out cruelty), but a few laws have changed since then. The hypocrisy of Texans is incredible. Everyone hates "drugs" but loves alcohol and caffeine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, my family and I are not rich by any means. The home values are so high because we live in an upscale area close to a major city. We're actually on the lower end of upscale and while we might have the funds to help keep my ass out of jail (while simultaneously giving us debt), it certainly isn't a route I want to go. It's not fair to put that burden on my folks. I suppose it all comes down to weighing the available factors. Millions of packages, quantity in my package, the amount of stealth offered, the stealth's "goodness" factor and efforts to track me down over $40 worth of illegal substances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not afraid of never receiving my package or losing my money. If I were to receive a letter from the post office saying they simply confiscated my goods, I'd be totally fine with that. What I am afraid of is further implications such as being prosecuted. Someone already mentioned Huntsville, so they must know the horrible stories that have come out of there. In fact, I heard of someone driving under the influence for the second time and receiving life or some crazy shit. That's no joke either. Texas is one of the worst places to be for anything drug related.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was thinking about trying QuikEMart's MDMA, but I can't find it listed. So now I'm thinking about ordering just one of these. Seems better than ordering two. What do you guys think?

    The only relevant difference between one and two is regret that you didn't get the second one. Would make no difference to local or federal LE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I spent a few seconds in a county jail in TX a few years ago. My cellmate was indeed doing six months for possession of one E pill (he was in county waiting for space to open up in the state facility). Were the circumstances of his arrest unique? No. Were his circumstances significantly different from yours? I'm guessing most likely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every decision, every choice, every risk taken involves a unique set of circumstances, possibilities, mitigating factors, etc. As many have said, nothing you learn here will set every one of those variables in your favor. They'll go a long way, but in the end, you have to do the math on all those variables and make your call. At the same time, your situation will most likely never be so unique that the vast amount of information in these forums -- if understood and followed -- won't allow you to make the best decision possible. And once you decide and act, then you have to let it go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally am waiting for my first order to arrive. Lurked around here for weeks, reading everything, until my anxiety became tempered by reason and knowledge. Then I ordered. And now? Well, I did my part. Made decisions based on reason, caution, and my specific circumstance (which include my state's laws and limits on possession.) So I wait. My package is somewhere in the system, churning through a sorter or waiting in a bin. Maybe it's at the PO down the street. Maybe it's sitting on the desk of the head of the FBI. Either way. Out of my hands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make your call, and let us know in a week how it goes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And while I'm here: Thanks to everyone who shared the knowledge that made my decision possible.

    You know, even though the odds are in my favor, I think I'm going to have to pass. I have too much a bright future ahead of me and, while I really wish America (and Texas in particular) wasn't so fucking gay, that doesn't make it so. I can't believe people are so ridiculous about the use of drugs but I guess that's just the way it is. I can't risk spending six months in jail and having a felony record. It's just not a smart move. Thanks to everyone who offered advice to me in this thread. May you all stay safe in your ventures of self exploration. Peace and love, everyone!

    It can be a tough, nerve-racking decision to first order something from SR man. I placed my first order in November and received it 2 weeks later, a few pills of MDMA from the Netherlands to the US. It sounds like you made up your mind about not ordering from SR, which is fine, but let me warn you about buying "molly" or pills from a dealer locally. You can never be really certain as to what is in them, whether it be meth/amps, piperazines, or other nasty stuff. If you do consider buying locally, order a Marquis test kit off (clearnet) dancesafe.org for $25. It is well worth it, trust me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I love SR because vendors have feedback which can let you know what other people think about their products. It tends to be easier to find really pure and potent MDMA on SR than on the streets. There is always a risk though, but for me that is a risk that I'm willing to take. I am not stupid enough to believe that I cannot be caught, but I highly doubt I'll be screwed over due to the vendors I pick, and the low amount I order. It's a personal decision, but when dealing with illegal drugs, there is ALWAYS a risk.

    I personally think that you have multiple factors at your disposal here:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Anonimity
    <br/>
    2. Plauable Deniability
    <br/>
    3. Escrow
    <br/>
    4. Guaranteed somewhat consistent Silk Road quality, which is going to be better than street.

    if you're so neurotic about buying a few pillscapsules off here, I don't see you as the type of person who can source it IRL.

    You really have to lurk both the main site and the forums for a while to get a real feel for what the risks are, who has good product, who has good stealth, etc. Look for reviews where everyone is RAVING about the stealth- 3jane, for instance, is a Canadian acid vendor and the only international vendor I can see myself ordering from because 1) everyone says she has good, clean LSD and 2) everyone is fucking blown away by the professionalism of her packaging.

    This. I lurked around for a month before buying anything. Once you get a feel for encryption, and work on some computer security and read up on the 4th and 5th ammendment, etc. you may change your mind.

    When you open your mail box, and open the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You will be like.... "OMG, I just got drugs in the mail"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And then "gulp"......"OMG I love Ecstasy"..."I think Im going to get more"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lol,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dont buy of the streets, Unless you know the dealer well, or a friends dealer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, Know that the product is actually MDMA. There is alot of Methylone being sold as MDMA, be very careful, and only buy from a legit source.

     It can be a tough, nerve-racking decision to first order something from SR man. I placed my first order in November and received it 2 weeks later, a few pills of MDMA from the Netherlands to the US. It sounds like you made up your mind about not ordering from SR, which is fine, but let me warn you about buying "molly" or pills from a dealer locally. You can never be really certain as to what is in them, whether it be meth/amps, piperazines, or other nasty stuff. If you do consider buying locally, order a Marquis test kit off (clearnet) dancesafe.org for $25. It is well worth it, trust me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I love SR because vendors have feedback which can let you know what other people think about their products. It tends to be easier to find really pure and potent MDMA on SR than on the streets. There is always a risk though, but for me that is a risk that I'm willing to take. I am not stupid enough to believe that I cannot be caught, but I highly doubt I'll be screwed over due to the vendors I pick, and the low amount I order. It's a personal decision, but when dealing with illegal drugs, there is ALWAYS a risk.

    You're right about that. I've heard that from a lot of sources now. Just the other day someone was trying to push $10 mollies on me and it just didn't seem to be the right price. The last thing I want right now is a meth addiction I don't even know I have. If I had my choice, I would prefer to order from SilkRoad specifically for the vendor ratings and high amount of knowledge everyone here seems to have. Any time you buy drugs, whether here or on the street, it's a gamble. You're risking a lot. Even back room deals you've done 100x over again are risks.

     I personally think that you have multiple factors at your disposal here:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Anonimity
     <br/>
     2. Plauable Deniability
     <br/>
     3. Escrow
     <br/>
     4. Guaranteed somewhat consistent Silk Road quality, which is going to be better than street.

     if you're so neurotic about buying a few pillscapsules off here, I don't see you as the type of person who can source it IRL.

    It does me no good to make the assumption that I'll "probably be OK." You're right, I'm definitely not the guy who's going to be able to spot the difference between good quality MDMA and some tar filled meth tab. The only drug I've ever touched is cannabis.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nobody on SR should feel safe while making an order. Anything we think here is nothing more than an assumption. Some people think a fake name is a good idea, others do not. Some think having it delivered to a friend's house is a good idea, others don't. As many wise people have said, this is a game of cat and mouse dictated by probability. Whenever an illegal substance is placed in the mail, there's always the chance it will be intercepted. If it's intercepted, you're now looking at the chance of them doing something about it. If they do, the chance that you'll get away with a slap on the wrist. This game of chance, of course, keeps branching off into different sections until you reach the last possible occurrence. The first step can set off a chain reaction that passes through all positive branches or one that hits all the branches that make life a living hell. The only way to know what will happen is to play the game. However, when the stakes are as high as they are, one would be wise to research the topic as much as possible before taking the risk.

    Some people here don't give a shit about life and don't mind working a 9 to 5 the rest of their lives just to make it to the weekend so they can do whatever. I, on the other hand, am not. I'll spare you my life story and future plans, but suffice it to say, I can't have a record.

     It took me two or three months of reading the forums before I made my first purchase. A few regulars who have been here much longer than that haven't even taken the plunge yet. Some never may.

     You really have to lurk both the main site and the forums for a while to get a real feel for what the risks are, who has good product, who has good stealth, etc. Look for reviews where everyone is RAVING about the stealth- 3jane, for instance, is a Canadian acid vendor and the only international vendor I can see myself ordering from because 1) everyone says she has good, clean LSD and 2) everyone is fucking blown away by the professionalism of her packaging. ("I finally had to message her to ask where it was"-  stuff like that.)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You'll have to do your own legwork here in order to be comfortable with what you're doing. I honestly think you could get some clean MDMA to your door with very little risk, but we can't convince you of that in one day in one thread, nor should we be able to. ;)

    Most definitely. I've lurked the forum forever now without ever making an account. I oscillate between the stages of "OK, I've done my research, I feel safe enough to order" and "What the hell am I thinking?" If I lived in another state where the penalties were less severe, I might consider placing the order.

    Some people enjoy the thrill of partaking in dangerous activities. Some people don't see the problem with hopping in a car with four friends and acting like a bunch of assholes on the road. Other people see the chance of their face splattering against the windshield. It's all high risk, big reward. Is it fun to go out and party with a bunch of friends? Fuck yeah it is. But it can also be extremely dangerous if you're with a bunch of people who don't understand mortality or the importance of life. The same goes for sex. Even though there are multiple ways to protect yourself from an unexpected pregnancy, you can still end up with a child. If you know deep down inside that you can't support that child physically or mentally, do you take the chance of experiencing a night of ecstasy with your partner or do you wait until you know that, should something go wrong, you can be responsible for your actions without burdening others?

    It's all a game of high risk, big reward. Some people play one way, others play another. It takes both types to make the world go round, but in the end, I'm part of the latter group.
