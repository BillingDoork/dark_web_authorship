    Is there any increased danger in re-shipping product? I would think so, in the rare case that it got seized and they are monitoring the address. As a vendor, it would be more beneficial to re-ship than to refund. But as a customer, if you doubted your vendor, a refund is preferable to a re-ship. Any comments?

    If the package does not arrive that means LE intercepted it,a druggie postal worker intercepted it,it was delivered to the wrong house and that person opened it and either reported it or kept it for themselves or threw it away because they dont like the neighbor ,or it was returned to sender and that address opened it. No matter who got it it was probably opened and SOMEONE is watching the address for more shipments. If they want a reship then by all means go ahead to keep them happy. They should however use a new address for their own safety to make sure the package gets through. if they want a refund then go ahead with that and im not a vendor but i wouldnt do business with them in the future just for security/scam purposes.

    One no show burns an address in my book. Even if you are not 100% sure what happened to the order you would be bloody stupid to keep ordering to the same address. Yes the chance of your mail being monitored after just one no show is highly unlikely but if anything else is intercepted on its way to that address then they have more chance of paying you a visit.

    Both responses are on point unless like with the DCN's &amp; it said undeliverable, then I would let it go into resolution &amp; say no refund &amp; no reship because you didn't follow directions!Â  (that generally only happens with n00bies)

    if you dont want to affect your stats then i would go with a reship to a fresh address. if that doesnt show up then count your losses and dont order from that vendor ever again.

    Besides it effecting your stats I am assuming you would rather have what you ordered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless I suspect something funny is going on I would re-ship to a different address and name.
