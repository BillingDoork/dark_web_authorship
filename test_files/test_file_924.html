    Does anyone have suggestions on drop locations? I'm gonna try import 100g's of Methylone in to Aus, but I really don't know how to go about a proper drop location... I was thinking about an abandoned house, or one up for sale...

    It's a big, wide web out there. Do you really need to ask for advice on where to post drugs to on the same site you're planning to order them from?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really wish people would make an effort to search and educate themselves before posting shit.

    You can ask someone that you know...

    " Hey Uncle Mike, would you mind if i had some stuff sent to me here? Its just car stuff, etc, then i can just throw it straight in the garage, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you see a vacant house that has been empty for awhile, do a quick dummy drop to that place. Dont use past resident name, just use a fake name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have view of vacant house from your place, then your set. If you see the drop, then go grab it from the back of the letter box, not the front, this is only possible if there is a fence, but if there is one, then your not seen taking mail from the box from nosey neighbours.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally havent done this, but if i had to, it would be tempting, for its a 100% clean drop unrelated to you, but only if the house had been vacated. Even better if its empty and being renovated, then you know it will be empty for awhile, and the tradies there wont bother with mail...unless the owner is there, so you keep removing any junk mail from that box so he/she are not inclined to check the box for mail. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To make it look legitimate, have a stack of pamphlets and drop them in every box as you make your way to the drop....funny i know, but would give you an excuse if you had to suddenly run around to the other side of box and retrieve what ever it is you may have dropped...? If someone suddenly approaches you..(your expecting this) you say i deposited the wrong pamphlet into the box, or i accidently put too many in and needed the rest to finish my run, by then you would have already snatched your prize and be on your way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course fake named drops are the best option, expensive, but at least you have piece of mind and can order larger orders to keep the amount of overall orders much lower..
