    So, I was outside smoking with a mate at his flat at 2 am when a police car drove in front of his house and a police officer left the car and looked at the mailboxes and then entered his car again.
    <br/>
    Is there a chance that the police is observing the mail and is waiting for other orders to arrive which they can intercept?

    at 2am?? i doubt it mate, i'm sure they'd know when the postie does his rounds. on top of that most little packages are just envelopes anyway, so even if it was just after the postie had been they'd be hard pushed to identify an envelope with drugs in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    whatever they're doing sounds pretty sketch but i don't think they're looking for mail order drugs

    Looking to see what house number they were at perhaps? They wouldn't be at that hour doing any 'cooperative effort' with the US Postal Service. Besides it's a jurisdictional boundary. No one, not even a cop, can tinker with your mail box, it's a felony! ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe they were looking for something to have on their break!Â  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously though, is there a chance? - Always. - Percent chance? About .03% In my guestimation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    [EDIT] Realized you said 'flat' and 'mate' - Forget the US Postal service rules. You'd know the possibilities better than I on that one.
    <br/>
    Even so. Don't people put their 'flat' #'s on the mailbox? Or last names? - Perhaps they looked and said to themselves, "Blimey! We're at the wrong blooming flat! Bloody hell!" - ( because that's how I think all 'bobbies' sound) - Sorry a little British-American humour there. (Very little, I know ::))

    Well i guess they were looking for something else! If they suspect you getting some Drugs via Mail, they would raid your home.

    So keep calm and Relax!!

    could they have seen if there was anything in the boxes? how close were they looking?

    sounds to me like they were checking up on names.... maybe in relation to mail order of drugs.

    More cautious is the way to go.
    <br/>
    Do we need to understand this mailboxe is for all of the towers?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could you make out if they were checking your mailbox or the one your buddy uses? Or randomly? I assume you can't, hence tried to verify that on CCTV.
    <br/>
    Be even more cautious if you have incoming orders (don't respond wether you do or don't, obviously).

    Police making rounds at 2am? that's already strange
    <br/>
    anyways im always in for extra caution
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so lay low for a while, check around maybe some other student did something stupid which made the pigs come after him or so
    <br/>
    <br/>
    better yet get a new drop address, but maybe that's just me being too paranoid

     <br/>
     completely sussed me out, givent thats theres a camera right on top,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     so the next day i did a mission and went into the managers office to duplicate a key,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     while he went behind , checked out the cctv footage and voila the maibox was not in the range of the camera :)
