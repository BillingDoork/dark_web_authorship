    So, I've ordered a very small quantity of a drug in powdered form from a trusted vendor from the Netherlands. His/her seizure rate is an awesome 98%, supposedly (I believe them).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I made the mistake of ordering registered mail, which gets here a bit faster, but requires a fucking signature. I am a bit apprehensive now that I think about it, but it is too late to turn back now 8)...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before I start asking questions- the package is likely no bigger than a regular envelope, with the dope completely sealed up in a fixture the size of a ballcard holder/case. It just depends on how the vendor chose the external packaging. Who knows, it could be more stealth than I think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, the questions:
    <br/>
    1.) Are the Netherlands (Holland) scrutinized more harshly due to the weed scene in the country?
    <br/>
    -Could this cause my package to be compromised?
    <br/>
    2.) Once registered mail gets here from the Nethrlands, how does it ship from there- standard, priority, express?
    <br/>
    -It cost about $20 for the upgraded "Registered Mail" option, if it gives you any clue...
    <br/>
    3.) Since the overall size of the package is so small and looks like a normal letter, do you think the chances of it being scrutinized are lowered?
    <br/>
    -I've been reading horror stories about packages being shipped express USPS and getting unwanted visitors, so if Registered Mail ships express once it gets to the US, should I be worried?
    <br/>
    4.) This vendor is very selective about shipping options for various products, so hopefully this is from experience with what is safe and what is not.&lt;--Is that a logical assumption, or just wishful thinking?
    <br/>
    5.) With this being such a miniscule amount, if, damn it anyway, it does get discovered, do you think they will take the time to pay me a visit or just send me a letter?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly, with this being such a small amount and knowing how it has been sealed up so well, I highly doubt any dogs or electronic sniffers could pick up on this, so it would have to be discovered by someone actually opening it up and inspecting it... Do they have authority to do this with registered mail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And, with me knowing what I know- if I were a postal inspector who cared about ruining people's day, I would probably scrutinize packages from the Netherlands a bit more than packages from say- France or England, myself. So, that in itself also brings about some worry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do ya'll think?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: Luckily, I do know the primary and secondary postal workers who have been servicing my route for quite a while, so I will likely know if they try a CD. So, I guess that's a good thing... Right?

    I sure hope so, and I have expressed my concerns. Luckily, he responded with a new way of shipping that was genius, think I was lucky enough to be one of the first to receive this type of packaging. I want to tell the whole world but don't want to kill the secret lol. I know there's no possible way for an electronic sniffer or dog could pick up on it, I'll just leave it at that.

    <br/>
    Btw, love the name. I'm a huge reggae fan, don't consider myself clean enough to consider myself an actual Rasta but do live by a lot of their principles. Still eat the shit outta meat, though, not gonna lie lol.
