    Hey there. I'm planning on buying a 25 strip of L, but I'm probably going to be moving out before I get the chance to consume it all. I'm obviously not going to take it on the plane ride to my new residence, so the only logical solution is to ship the L to my new address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will I be able to do this safely and easily? Or should I only buy as much L as I can eat before I move?

    I'm new to Silk Road. I just wasn't sure whether or not I'd be able to pull off a DIY replication of the stealthy shipping methods that vendors use.

    I assume L = LSD?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, I wouldn't take it on the plane. Airport security makes me nervous enough. Even though essentially it's just a strip of paper with a miniscule amount of drug on it.
    <br/>
    Just send it in the mail to your new address. No special shipping methods needed for LSD. You could easily ship 1000 tabs inside a Christmas card and it would arrive without a problem. Just make it look like any other package in the mail.

    smuggling is much serious crime than posession, right?
    <br/>
    You'd better keep your ass safe.
    <br/>
    After all, why don't send blotters via mail to your new address? It's easy and safe.
