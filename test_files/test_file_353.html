    I was a prosecutor in a medium sized mid-west state in the US for 13 years.  I focused mainly on drug crimes.  I prosecuted numerous cases where the drugs were intercepted in the mail.  I left the prosecutor's office in 2010 (before SR existed to my knowledge).  I left because I realized how pointless the "drug war" is.  99.9% of the time we were busting low level dealers who were doing nothing except selling to support their habit.  I'm happy to answer any of your questions to the best of my ability.

    I didn't work directly with the postal inspectors most of the time, but I was never referred a case with a small amount of drugs.  I personally never saw a package with a small amount.  I'm sure they intercepted some, but they never referred it for prosecution.

    The object of the war on drugs is not to eradicate drugs, it's to mitigate consumption, i think.
    <br/>
    Would you want the whole country able to buy heron at a convenience store?
    <br/>
    If you want to get into a philosophical debate, sure, I am all for free markets and libertarian politics. In a utopian world, drugs should be legal, but that's not how it works here so oh well.
    <br/>
    Your job as a legal professional is to have no personal attachment to the cases. I guess that's impossible though. I always get a laugh when prosecutors think they're "going after bad guys. Its not the people its the institution!!!  Ok sorry to ramble, im a bit stoned :P

    Of course it is only going to mitigate consumption.  No, I don't think you should be able to buy hard drugs at a convenience store.  However, I also don't think you should go to prison for 60 years for selling 1 gram of cocaine either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't have a personal attachment to 99% of my cases.  I know most of the time I'm not going after "bad guys."  However, there are some very bad guys I have gone after and I'm proud of that.

    Never prosecuted anyone for mdma or lsd.  I never saw a case referred for prosecution that was less than a pound for marijuana or 2 ounces for cocaine.  Definitely not saying you are safe if you order less, but most offices don't have time to mess with small time buyers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On another note, what I find interesting about this place is how the risk is totally the opposite of how it normally is.  Most of the time, we were only interested in dealers.  The only time users were arrested was when they were caught by uniform officers, usually during traffic stops.  Seems to me that the easiest way to get busted here is when you are the buyer.  Most of the time when undercover cops bust the buyers it is because they want to get to the dealer.  Obviously, there is no way a buyer on SR knows who the seller is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One piece of advice I can give everyone is to never NEVER talk to the cops if you get busted.  They will act like they are your friend and they will tell you it will be better if you talk.  Sometimes you can get a better deal if you talk, but don't think for an instant that you have to talk right away.  You can always ask for a lawyer.  If you do have good info, then the cops can wait.  If people didn't talk, we would have solved a lot less cases.

    Prosecutors and Judges are no different from anyone else.  There is a judge in my county that uses cocaine too, but everyone is too afraid to talk.  You would be surprised by how many prosecutors and cops use drugs.

    THIS is 1000000000000% correct.  SHUT UP ALWAYS, everyone SHUT UP no matter what they tell you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good to see you on here if this is really who you were for the potential good you might be able to do now. But for 13 years you screwed many innocent people just trying to get high and diverted resources from 'real' crime that needed more attention.

    we did it, but maybe keep thread on track with getting information. focus on important info, not asking stupid Q.

    Actually, it will most definitely not HELP you. There is a reason police ask the questions asked, and that is to make their job easier. You are faarrrrrrrrr better off just giving req'd identification and and politely decline said "discussion" until someone who is slightly more versed in the laws of your jurisdiction. ANYTHING you say CAN/WILL.

    Q1:  Most of the cases I prosecuted were controlled buys either from an undercover cop or a CI.  All of those buys were definitely audio recorded and a lot of them had video too.  If we used a CI, that person is strip searched and will have nothing on them when they make the buy (except for the buy money we gave them).  If someone is buying drugs and they only have cash (no cell phone, ID etc.), beware.  There is a good chance the person is working for the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Q2:  There are definitely cases I had where mail was intercepted based on a tip from an informant or undercover officer.  However, there were also cases that were simply intercepted.  I can remember one case where a prominent person in our city was ordering MJ seeds from Amsterdam.  He got busted because it got intercepted by Customs.  Got a search warrant and made a controlled delivery.  He was found with a bunch of marijuana plants growing in his house.  Lesson here is to have your house "clean" if you are getting a delivery.  If they search your house and you keep your mouth shut, I can't see them prosecuting you unless they have other evidence.

    I will never say it is a safe bet to mail any amount.  You never know what info the police have on you.  If they want to bust you for some reason, it doesn't matter how much you get.  You can refuse to sign for the package, but chances are they already know who you are.  If it is in someone elses name, then refusing to sign will work.  If it is in your name, they know it is you.  They will have all the background info on the name on the package.  Likely have a picture from your driver's license or old book in photo.  If it is in your actual name and you refuse it by saying it is not in your name, that is worse.  If it is shipped in your name, best thing you can do is not have anything else illegal in your house and take the package.  Don't open it and when they search your house (and they will search your house).  Deny, deny deny.  Tell them you have no idea where that package came from.  Don't say anything else.

    The only information you are ever required to tell an officer is your identifying information.  Sometimes you don't even have to tell them that depending on the circumstances.  If they have no reason to stop you, you don't have to tell them anything.  Laws will vary from state to state, but police can't stop you for no reason.  If a police officer starts asking questions.  Always ask him if you are under arrest.  If he says no, then ask if you are free to leave.  If he says yes, then get the fuck out of there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never admit to anything.  I can't stress this enough.  Anything you say can be used against you.  Most of the cases I prosecuted involved people talking to the police.  It always amazes me how people keep thinking police are their friends.  They are not your friends now matter how charming they are.  I've seen people with long criminal records who never learn that lesson.

    I suppose I had that coming.  I'm not proud of everything I did and that's why I left.  I don't believe that using drugs should make you a criminal, but there are a lot of criminals who use drugs.  The majority of the violent crimes I prosecuted involved drugs.  Sure, some of that was because the drugs are illegal, such as a turf war between dealers, but there are a lot of people out there who would be criminals whether or not they were on drugs.  Some people can't handle drugs, just like some people can't handle alcohol.  People will drive when they are high and kill someone, just like people do that when they are drunk.  Some people become addicts and commit crimes.  The crimes they commit (other than just using the drugs) should be prosecuted.

    It is that easy to get a warrant and he did not have any previous record.  In fact, he was a prominent doctor in our city.  Of course, they will have to confirm some things before they get a warrant, but if they package is in the name of a person who lives at the house, that is enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I figured some would see this as suspicious.  I don't see this as helping criminals.  I don't think using drugs should make someone a criminal.  I'm not saying all drugs should be legal and available at 7-11, but there is a better way to deal with a person who has a problem with drugs.  I saw (and prosecuted) many people who were simply using drugs and not committing any other crimes.  It can ruin your life, career etc. and I don't think that is right.  I guess part of the reason I'm on here is because I feel guilty about some of the cases I prosecuted.  I can't take back what I did, but maybe I can help someone avoid being labeled a criminal in the future.

     Q1:  Most of the cases I prosecuted were controlled buys either from an undercover cop or a CI.  All of those buys were definitely audio recorded and a lot of them had video too.  If we used a CI, that person is strip searched and will have nothing on them when they make the buy (except for the buy money we gave them).  If someone is buying drugs and they only have cash (no cell phone, ID etc.), beware.  There is a good chance the person is working for the police.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Q2:  There are definitely cases I had where mail was intercepted based on a tip from an informant or undercover officer.  However, there were also cases that were simply intercepted.  I can remember one case where a prominent person in our city was ordering MJ seeds from Amsterdam.  He got busted because it got intercepted by Customs.  Got a search warrant and made a controlled delivery.  He was found with a bunch of marijuana plants growing in his house.  Lesson here is to have your house "clean" if you are getting a delivery.  If they search your house and you keep your mouth shut, I can't see them prosecuting you unless they have other evidence.

    I'm assuming you are talking about the cases I saw using the mail, but I personally never saw a case with less than a pound of MJ.  That doesn't mean they won't bust you with less, but I personally never saw anything less.  If you are talking about cases in general, not necessarily using the mail, then I've seen anything from a roach to hundreds of pounds.  Where I live, any amount is illegal.

    We never used info on laptops, although I'm sure that is becoming more common since this place is well known to law enforcement.  This place didn't exist when I was a prosecutor.

    Whenever we did a controlled delivery, we always had a search warrant signed before the delivery.  We never gave the person a chance to open up the package.  Too much of a risk that they would get rid of the evidence.  Most of the time people had other drugs inside the house, so they were screwed whether or not we could prove they ordered the package.  Most of the time, they confessed to the police.  If you have a clean house and don't say anything other than I don't know what's in the package, then you have a good chance of getting away with it, unless of course they already have other evidence, in which case you are screwed no matter what you do.  I would never prosecute a case where the only evidence was somebody was delivered a package that had illegal drugs in it.  We needed something else, such as a confession (never a good idea) or other evidence that the person knew what was in the package.

    Q1:  We never sent a CI in without wearing a wire that can be monitored.  If you don't trust the person, you could search them, although I understand that might not be good for business.  If it is an undercover cop, they may or may not be wearing a wire.  Bottom line is you are going to sell, you should only sell to people you know and trust, but even then, they might turn on you if they get busted.  That happens all the time.  Where I live, we would never allow the CI to use drugs with the seller.  We would tell them to make something up like "I can't today because I have to take a drug test for a job tomorrow."

    Q2:  Simply accepting a package (not signing for it) that is not in your name would not be enough evidence.  They would need a lot more evidence than that.  We either made the person sign for the package or we set up surveillance and waited for the person to get the package from their porch.  Most of the time we made them sign for it because cops don't want to sit there for hours waiting for someone to get a package off their porch.  Simply signing for a package isn't enough evidence either as long as it is in your name or someone else's name who lives at the house.  If you sign for a package being delivered to Mickey Mouse, that would be pretty suspicious.  We prosecuted a lot of controlled delivery cases.  Feds usually don't mess with anything unless it is a large quantity or there are guns involved.

    I do think about it and regret it, but if it wasn't me, it would have been somebody else doing the same thing.  I didn't make the bullshit laws.  I can't change the past, but I hope I can help others avoid being labeled as criminals.

    If you are confident that it will get delivered to your house with a fake name, I would use a fake name, especially if you have multiple people living in your house.  The hardest cases we had were when drugs were found in a car or a house in an area where multiple people had access to it.  As long as everyone kept their mouth shut, there is no way we could prosecute those cases because you can't prove beyond a reasonable doubt who it belonged to.  If it's being delivered in your own name, that is certainly more evidence that it is yours.

    As a prosecutor, do you dip into a defendant's background any in consideration for a case?  Like for instance, say a guy's package gets intercepted with like .25g of meth.  But you pull up some background info and see the guy's holding a steady 80k/year job and participates in community events, and seems to stay out of trouble well enough otherwise (no other real criminal history).

    Do you really go out of your way to ruin this man for enjoying a little meth here and there?  Because, for the most part, having any criminal charges of ANY kind tend to make finding jobs nearly impossible, plus it ruins said man's faith in the justice system for life, tears apart his connections to family and friends by locking him up for a couple years over such petty things...

    Doubt it.  They are going to need more than an anonymous call saying the person is getting drugs.  Anonymous call + drugs shipped to house does not = person getting arrested and going to prison.  It will take more than that.  When we had someone who talked, it was a known person and we confirmed what they told us.  A court would throw out the evidence very quickly if it was found to be based on only an anonymous tip because of the situation you describe.  We had anonymous calls all the time to report drunk drivers, but a cop can't stop the person just based on the anonymous call.  They need more evidence before they can stop the car.  Same thing here.

    Exactly, so receiving a package with drugs does not mean drugs were purchased by owner of house. LE has to show the owner purchased the drugs and had them delivered to his address. How would LE proof drugs were purchased when using our system? BTW thank you for being here and helping out. I assume you were looking for drugs yourself and felt bad about your past.

    Most of the time we were not heavily involved in the case on the front end.  The police did an investigation and sent it to our office for a decision whether to file charges.  Once it got to our office, if we believed that we can prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, we would file the case regardless of their background.  We looked at their background when deciding what plea agreement we gave.  I don't feel like we ever went out of our way to ruin a person's life, although I realize that is often the result.

    You obviously haven't been victimized by the war on drugs yet, and I hope you never are, but until then you'll never understand why I said what I said. There is a way for him to make things right, and that would be to serve prison time, just like he made everyone else do. Just doing a job because somebody else would be doing it anyway is not a viable excuse. Spend some time in the place you've sent people for the last 13 years and see how you like it, or better yet, how long you'd even fucking last. While I am pleased to see that you are "attempting" to right your wrongs, this doesn't even closely begin to cover the things you've done, you'll get no respect or sympathy out of me. Come back when you actually know the pain you've caused to other, HJAnslinger.

    The beauty of this system is that the buyer has no idea who is selling them the drugs.  I still talk to some people I used to work with and they talk about this place.  They don't know what to do about it.  In general, the police are interested in getting drug dealers.  They will arrest buyers to get to the dealers.  They try to flip small time dealers to get to bigger dealers, but that rarely happens.  Usually they are just getting other small dealers.  The only way I know of that they could prove you were using SR is by seizing your computer and finding evidence on it or by you telling them.  Even if that happens, they still won't be able to get to the dealer.  SR is very frustrating to law enforcement.  I just talked to a cop who was at a conference where the DEA was talking about SR.  According to him, they don't have a clue with how to bust this place and the DEA guy was one of their computer experts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had read about this place online and I had heard about it from some people I used to work with, so I thought I would take a look.  It's pretty tempting for me to get some drugs for myself on here, but I doubt I do that.  I've pissed off some people in law enforcement and there would be nothing more they would love than to arrest me.  Too much risk for me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm happy to share what I can to help.  As I stated before, you shouldn't be labeled a criminal because you use drugs, but I know plenty of criminals who happen to use drugs.

    You may know, but I think most of us dislike most crime as much as you prolly do, and wish no harm in any of our drug-related doings which are still criminal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think most of the worst troubled drug users (and prolly criminals in general) are somewhat weak/vulnerable and troubled people (abused,traumatized,neglected,lacking education,poverty,injustice etc., or such) with different issues leading to their drug abuse that is the main problem, and most are aware of in some way, but doesn't really mean any harm..many just don't know better,for unfortunate reasons. Hopefully with spreading well-being and good knowledge/education and all, will fix most of this in the future so people will be able to make their own well educated choises themselves, so you guys can focus on other troubled beings that may be a bigger threat to more peoples well-being and further spread the misery thru violence and such.
    <br/>
    Hopefully the drug war, in its current form atleast, will end soon, and be replaced with better knowledge and understanding and fairness, instead of prison and pain that I think just makes worse. Atleast that's what I think so far..
    <br/>
    But eh,sorry I talk alot some times,heh..will end here for now=P

    Like you said, it varies greatly.  In my county, if the guy didn't have a criminal record, he's likely only going to get probation.  It might even get reduced to a misdemeanor if he doesn't get in trouble while on probation.  I can't remember any cases where we had pounds and it was the person's first drug charge.

Hopefully with spreading well-being and good knowledge/education and all, will fix most of this in the future so people will be able to make their own well educated choises themselves, so you guys can focus on other troubled beings that may be a bigger treat to more peoples well-being and further spread the misery thru violence and such.
     <br/>
     Hopefully the drug war, in its current form atleast, will end soon, and be replaced with better knowledge and understanding instead of prison and pain that I think just makes worse. Atleast that's what I think so far..
     <br/>
     But eh,sorry I talk alot some times,heh..will end here for now=P
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks again, and happy holidays and good night everyone,wherever on the planet you reside:)

    You're welcome and I agree with you.  Just because some people can't handle drugs, doesn't mean it should be illegal for the people who can.  Some people are obese because of all the fast food they eat, but I don't see them making McDonald's illegal anytime soon (although Mayor Bloomburg might).

     You obviously haven't been victimized by the war on drugs yet, and I hope you never are, but until then you'll never understand why I said what I said. There is a way for him to make things right, and that would be to serve prison time, just like he made everyone else do. Just doing a job because somebody else would be doing it anyway is not a viable excuse. Spend some time in the place you've sent people for the last 13 years and see how you like it, or better yet, how long you'd even fucking last. While I am pleased to see that you are "attempting" to right your wrongs, this doesn't even closely begin to cover the things you've done, you'll get no respect or sympathy out of me. Come back when you actually know the pain you've caused to other, HJAnslinger.

    Just a thank you to the OP. Very good of you to come here and share your knowledge and experience.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the people who've been prosecuted and done jail time, maybe you could stop raging and pay attention. You're less likely to end up back in jail if you make use of resources like this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As an aside, I whole-heartedly agree with your sentiment about 'Using drugs shouldn't make you a criminal, but lots of criminals use drugs'. I came to SR because I'm an otherwise upstanding citizen who likes to get high, and doesn't like to consort with criminals in order to do so.

     Never prosecuted anyone for mdma or lsd.  I never saw a case referred for prosecution that was less than a pound for marijuana or 2 ounces for cocaine.  Definitely not saying you are safe if you order less, but most offices don't have time to mess with small time buyers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On another note, what I find interesting about this place is how the risk is totally the opposite of how it normally is.  Most of the time, we were only interested in dealers.  The only time users were arrested was when they were caught by uniform officers, usually during traffic stops.  Seems to me that the easiest way to get busted here is when you are the buyer.  Most of the time when undercover cops bust the buyers it is because they want to get to the dealer.  Obviously, there is no way a buyer on SR knows who the seller is.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One piece of advice I can give everyone is to never NEVER talk to the cops if you get busted.  They will act like they are your friend and they will tell you it will be better if you talk.  Sometimes you can get a better deal if you talk, but don't think for an instant that you have to talk right away.  You can always ask for a lawyer.  If you do have good info, then the cops can wait.  If people didn't talk, we would have solved a lot less cases.

    I left the prosecutor's office before this place existed, so I don't have any inside info on what the DEA is doing to try to shut this place down.  I'm sure they are monitoring this website, but I don't know what they can do about it.  It will be a lot harder to bust the vendors since the buyers have no idea who they are.

    I'm definitely not a computer expert, but if they saw you were using TOR and you had the silk road website as a bookmark, that would be a pretty good clue.  Using SR isn't really going to make much of a difference to the buyer.  The crime is possession of the drugs, not where you got them from.

      Never prosecuted anyone for mdma or lsd.  I never saw a case referred for prosecution that was less than a pound for marijuana or 2 ounces for cocaine.  Definitely not saying you are safe if you order less, but most offices don't have time to mess with small time buyers.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      On another note, what I find interesting about this place is how the risk is totally the opposite of how it normally is.  Most of the time, we were only interested in dealers.  The only time users were arrested was when they were caught by uniform officers, usually during traffic stops.  Seems to me that the easiest way to get busted here is when you are the buyer.  Most of the time when undercover cops bust the buyers it is because they want to get to the dealer.  Obviously, there is no way a buyer on SR knows who the seller is.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      One piece of advice I can give everyone is to never NEVER talk to the cops if you get busted.  They will act like they are your friend and they will tell you it will be better if you talk.  Sometimes you can get a better deal if you talk, but don't think for an instant that you have to talk right away.  You can always ask for a lawyer.  If you do have good info, then the cops can wait.  If people didn't talk, we would have solved a lot less cases.

     The list paragraph needs to be drilled into young people. If you've done something wrong (and we all know if we've done something wrong or not) then you do not say a fucking word to the police.

     In your experience what approximate percantage of cases were solved due to the confession of the convicted rather than pure detective and prosecution work?

    Hard to put an actual percentage on it, but it's well over 50%.  One of the big tricks the cops use to get a confession is to lie to you and tell you that your friend/co-defendant already told them everything.  They will say that they are "giving you a chance" to help yourself.  That's BS.  Even if your friend did talk, you are only going to screw yourself.  If the only evidence we had was the testimony of another admitted drug user, we wouldn't be able to prove our case.  No mater what they tell you, don't talk.

    How much worse will the penalty be if the drugs were imported? For example being charged for an ounce of weed vs an ounce plus importing from another country.
    <br/>
    Also at which quantities of weed you are more likely to get jail-time than probation? For a person without previous record. If this is affected by state law please give me a rough estimation for your state, that you have experience.

    Do either of the following provide protection...

    1. Person A accepts payment and person B delivers. Drugs and money are never in the same place.

    Where I worked, it wouldn't be any worse if you imported from another country.  Can't really answer your question about quantities of weed getting jail vs. probation.  Not only does it vary from state to state, it can vary from court to court.  Quantity isn't the only thing they look at when determining a sentence.  Many many other factors.

    1.  You have a constitutional right to remain silent in the US.  A prosecutor cannot use your silence against you in court.  A judge can't use your silence against you either.  There are times when cooperating with the police can be helpful to you, but you should get a good lawyer before you talk to the police.  If they have enough evidence to prosecute you, they will do that whether or not you help them.  If they file charges, then you have a right to see the evidence they have against you.  If it looks like you are screwed, then you could make the decision to help the police in order to get a better deal, but being a snitch obviously can cause other problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2.  It depends what the search warrant says.  If it says they can take all of the computers and related devices, then yes they will do that.  Even if it was someone elses computer, they would take it too.

    Not really sure what you are asking.  You are always taking a chance when you have drugs with you in public.  You could get stopped for a speeding ticket and if the cop gets suspicious and runs a drug dog around your car, you are busted.  It will be safer to keep them in your home.  It is much more difficult for the police to search your house.  They would have to get a search warrant.

    There is no foolproof way to sell illegal drugs.  There is always a chance you will get caught.  The only thing you can do is minimize the chances of being caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem with #1 is that person B could be selling to the police or a CI.  When person B gets caught, they might talk to the police and give up person A.  That's how most dealers end up getting caught.  You have the same problem with #2.  The person buying the drugs could be working for the police.  If you are going to sell, the less people you sell to the better.  If you are selling to 100 different people, there is a good chance some of them will get caught.  There is also a good chance they will end up working as a CI and set you up.  In my opinion, the SR is the safest way to deal drugs.  Almost impossible to find out who the seller is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the police are doing surveillance, it could be a variety of things.  They could be watching you from another location.  They could get a warrant and tap your phone lines.  The length of time is going to depend on how big a dealer the person is.  If it's someone just selling a few ounces of weed a week, they are not going to set up 24 hour surveillance.  They are looking for any evidence they can use against you.  You likely will never know they are conducting surveillance until it is too late.

    Its pretty scary that 'they' would go through the trouble of getting a warrant for some seeds. Was this guy growing for personal use ? What type of info would they need other than the seeds to get a warrant like this. Would there have to be evidence of trafficking or something ?

       Will you please outline how one should sell drugs in real life?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do either of the following provide protection...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       1. Person A accepts payment and person B delivers. Drugs and money are never in the same place.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       2. Person A takes the money and a location for a dead drop is provided. Drugs are not hand delivered.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'd also like to know about surveillance. How does it work, how long does it typically go on for, what is LE enforcement looking for? I know this is very general and I'm sory for that. Any information you can provide would be great.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thanks again.

      There is no foolproof way to sell illegal drugs.  There is always a chance you will get caught.  The only thing you can do is minimize the chances of being caught.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The problem with #1 is that person B could be selling to the police or a CI.  When person B gets caught, they might talk to the police and give up person A.  That's how most dealers end up getting caught.  You have the same problem with #2.  The person buying the drugs could be working for the police.  If you are going to sell, the less people you sell to the better.  If you are selling to 100 different people, there is a good chance some of them will get caught.  There is also a good chance they will end up working as a CI and set you up.  In my opinion, the SR is the safest way to deal drugs.  Almost impossible to find out who the seller is.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If the police are doing surveillance, it could be a variety of things.  They could be watching you from another location.  They could get a warrant and tap your phone lines.  The length of time is going to depend on how big a dealer the person is.  If it's someone just selling a few ounces of weed a week, they are not going to set up 24 hour surveillance.  They are looking for any evidence they can use against you.  You likely will never know they are conducting surveillance until it is too late.

     So regarding number 2. What risk is there if you accept large amounts of cash from someone and never having drugs on your person or in your house?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you never have the drugs on you, just the money, what is the worst that can happen?
     <br/>
     <br/>

    <br/>
    Why is person A taking the money?  There had to have been some sort of communication about the amount of money, where the drop will be, what the person is buying etc.  If the person buying the drugs is working for the police, they are going to have a record of those conversations.  Just because you didn't have the drugs on you, you are still guilty of dealing.  Even if you don't participate in the entire deal, you can still be found guilty.

      It is that easy to get a warrant and he did not have any previous record.  In fact, he was a prominent doctor in our city.  Of course, they will have to confirm some things before they get a warrant, but if they package is in the name of a person who lives at the house, that is enough.

     Its pretty scary that 'they' would go through the trouble of getting a warrant for some seeds. Was this guy growing for personal use ? What type of info would they need other than the seeds to get a warrant like this. Would there have to be evidence of trafficking or something ?

    He was not just growing for personal use, but that wouldn't matter.  They confirmed that he lived at the address and did a controlled delivery.  They got what is called an anticipatory search warrant.  Basically, it gives the police permission to execute the search warrant once the person accepts the delivery because the person is now in possession of an illegal substance.

    This is what i've heard before about cd's on mail delivery. They discover the goods and when you sign for it they execute the warrant. Or if you take the package inside, in some situations. What you said seems to confirm that they can't execute the warrant without some evidence the person knew what was in it. IOW, a package of drugs sent to your name proves nothing unless you take it inside or sign for it. Have you heard of them executing a warrant with just a package sent to their name and no other factors involved? Lets say they leave it in the mailbox for a good long time or refuse to sign for it?

    HJ,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What advice can you give to resellers here on SR. People who buy product on SR to resell that same product here on the road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems, given what you've said so far, the main weakness is having the product shipped to you and if you're getting large quantities there is the potential for large issues. What precautions can be taken?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think what typically happens is the reseller would setup a virtual office to have the mail delivered to that is either in his name, another persons name, or the name of a company setup for this purpose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do any of these options provide more or less protection than the other options providing said person is still picking up the delivery at some point?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would having additional names or fictional people listed on the virtual office paperwork provide any protection since the reseller could potentially claim this other person ordered it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What would proper proceedure be? Does wirtting "return to sender" on the package and not opening it for a few days provide any protection at all?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I tried to outline all the options I know of. If you know of others or have any insightful information on this topic I'm sure a number of poeple would find it useful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks.

    Thank you for your insights, and while I admittedly do share the bitter sentiments of my fellows here, I know nobody is born knowing everything.  You changed.  That's all anyone should ever ask of another person -- to change for the better.  For what it's worth, you seem to have decided to do that.  You're an excellent human being today, apparently (you don't beat your wife or anything, right?  Right, of course not).  The fact that a year ago you were a life-ruining monstrosity doesn't have the power to change today, just as today doesn't have the power to change the past.  Punishment helps nothing, it only satisfies petty desires for revenge and a "fair" (i.e. vengeful) society.  Punishing others is worse than a waste of time: it does nothing but harm to them and makes them wish to do the same back to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously, don't we all agree that one of the things wrong with our justice system in this age is it's insistance on inflicting suffering for no gain whatsoever to those who have harmed no one but themselves?  Shouldn't law be *only* about prevention and rehabilitation?  Causing more pain and spewing more anger only invites the same to be thrown back at you.  It sucks and it's hard, but it's the truth -- anger is virtually never helpful.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In short, wtf is wrong with some of you.  Let him teach what he has to teach.  Damn, peoplez, be selfish and learn what you can if nothing else.

    Hi HJ
    <br/>
    Let's say someone from an European country sends a very small amount of a controlled substance like lsd to the US. The letter gets intercepted and police finds a fingerprint (from the sender). Will they run a check on fingerprints in their database? If so, are these fingerprints only from people who have already committed a crime or do they have the possibility to run a check on fingerprints of everyone who ever has entered the country?
    <br/>
    Many thanks.

    LOL... I think it may provide some insight to remember a really simple fact: police arrest you.  Prosecutors prosecute you.  Police don't have to be sure you did it.  They just have to think there's a reasonable chance that you did -- the rest is up to the courts, and their job's over.  They don't really just let some guy walk away because he's being a weird asshole.  If you piss them off, they WILL ruin at least one of your days.  I believe they have the right to detain anyone, for any reason (or for no reason), for up to 24 hours.  Sitting in jail for 24 hours sucks, I'm sure, but at least you'd be out of their goddamn way while they brought in those sniffer dogs you demanded...  :P

     What advice can you give to resellers here on SR. People who buy product on SR to resell that same product here on the road.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It seems, given what you've said so far, the main weakness is having the product shipped to you and if you're getting large quantities there is the potential for large issues. What precautions can be taken?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I think what typically happens is the reseller would setup a virtual office to have the mail delivered to that is either in his name, another persons name, or the name of a company setup for this purpose.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Do any of these options provide more or less protection than the other options providing said person is still picking up the delivery at some point?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Would having additional names or fictional people listed on the virtual office paperwork provide any protection since the reseller could potentially claim this other person ordered it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What would proper proceedure be? Does wirtting "return to sender" on the package and not opening it for a few days provide any protection at all?
     <br/>

    The police are going to do their homework before they make a controlled delivery.  They are going to find out who lives in the house, who is the name on the package etc.  The problem with using a fake name is that if you sign for the package, they are going to wonder why you would sign for a package belonging to someone who doesn't exist.  It is certainly better to have more layers between you and the package, but if they are fake people, chances are they are going to find that out.  If you are buying large quantities, they are going to invest a lot more time in investigating you.  They will set up surveillance and find out everything they can about the address where the package is delivered to.  If they see you or someone else pick up the package, you can bet they will stop that person and arrest them.  If you are going to use a fake name, under no circumstances should you sign for the package.  If they try to get you to sign for the package, tell them you don't know who that is and they have the wrong address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my experience, the more simple the story is, the better.  Once you start adding layers, that gives them more things to look at.  If there are fake names, they will likely figure that out.  If there are real people, they will try to get them to turn on you.  My advice would be to have a clean house when you get a package.  Have the package sent in your name and sign for the package if it becomes a controlled delivery.  Do not open the package and if/when they come busting down your door, claim you have no idea what is in the package or who sent it.  They will continue to ask you questions.  At that point, tell them you are done answering questions and you want a lawyer.  That will provide the most protection in my opinion, but it is still not foolproof.  If you have been receiving large shipments, particularly if it is coming from the same zip code, they might have other evidence against you.  In my jurisdiction, we never had a large scale shipping operation, but I could see them letting some packages go through if they knew you were receiving packages on a regular basis.  They could let you have some packages that they knew had drugs in them.  They could conduct surveillance and notice you mailing packages.  They could intercept those packages and see that you were mailing the same drugs they just delivered to you.  If it appeared to be a normal delivery to you, but the police knew there were drugs in the package, your claim of not knowing what was in the controlled delivery package might not be believed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bottom line is don't give them any evidence that you were the one that ordered the package.  Don't even have your computer anywhere near your house when you get the package.  You could write return to sender on the package, but I think that looks suspicious if it is sent in your name and you haven't opened the package.

    If the police ever find a fingerprint, there is no doubt they will run it through the national database.  Most of the fingerprints are from people who have been arrested in the past, but I think they also have some fingerprints of people who have or do work for the government.  I don't believe they have fingerprints from everyone who entered the country, but I don't know that for sure.  By the time I get a case, the police have already run any fingerprint evidence, so I'm not sure what all is in their database.  Most people don't understand how rare it is to find a useable fingerprint.  Shows like CSI make it sound like you can find fingerprints everywhere.  That is simply not the case.  Of course, you should take precautions, but the chances of finding a fingerprint are rare.  Less than 1% of all the cases I handled involved fingerprints.  In fact, I can't think of more than a few cases I handled in 13 years that had useable fingerprints and none of them were drug cases.

    I don't know if you've ever dealt with the police, but they are the ones who control the situation, not you.  If you start telling them how to do their investigation, you will probably not like the consequences.  If they don't do their job, let your lawyer show that in court.  There is no reason to talk to the police.

     The police are going to do their homework before they make a controlled delivery.  They are going to find out who lives in the house, who is the name on the package etc.  The problem with using a fake name is that if you sign for the package, they are going to wonder why you would sign for a package belonging to someone who doesn't exist.  It is certainly better to have more layers between you and the package, but if they are fake people, chances are they are going to find that out.  If you are buying large quantities, they are going to invest a lot more time in investigating you.  They will set up surveillance and find out everything they can about the address where the package is delivered to.  If they see you or someone else pick up the package, you can bet they will stop that person and arrest them.  If you are going to use a fake name, under no circumstances should you sign for the package.  If they try to get you to sign for the package, tell them you don't know who that is and they have the wrong address.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In my experience, the more simple the story is, the better.  Once you start adding layers, that gives them more things to look at.  If there are fake names, they will likely figure that out.  If there are real people, they will try to get them to turn on you.  My advice would be to have a clean house when you get a package.  Have the package sent in your name and sign for the package if it becomes a controlled delivery.  Do not open the package and if/when they come busting down your door, claim you have no idea what is in the package or who sent it.  They will continue to ask you questions.  At that point, tell them you are done answering questions and you want a lawyer.  That will provide the most protection in my opinion, but it is still not foolproof.  If you have been receiving large shipments, particularly if it is coming from the same zip code, they might have other evidence against you.  In my jurisdiction, we never had a large scale shipping operation, but I could see them letting some packages go through if they knew you were receiving packages on a regular basis.  They could let you have some packages that they knew had drugs in them.  They could conduct surveillance and notice you mailing packages.  They could intercept those packages and see that you were mailing the same drugs they just delivered to you.  If it appeared to be a normal delivery to you, but the police knew there were drugs in the package, your claim of not knowing what was in the controlled delivery package might not be believed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bottom line is don't give them any evidence that you were the one that ordered the package.  Don't even have your computer anywhere near your house when you get the package.  You could write return to sender on the package, but I think that looks suspicious if it is sent in your name and you haven't opened the package.

    When shipping to a virtual office you will not be there to receive the package. The employee of the VO will sign for it if a signature is required, then it will be placed in your box to be picked up when you want to. You could let the package sit for a day or more before even picking it up. This also means there is no house. It could also mean there is no name on the package because it's quite easy to use a fake business anme. At this point I guess LE would ask the employees at the VO who does the address belong to, stake out the virtual office, stake out your home as well after they get that information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, when someone goes to a VO to pick up a package that has been delivered to a fake business name, it's likely that's when they will be arrested by LE?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am shocked you advise to sign for a package at all but exp if you think it's a controlled delivery...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Quote from you: "Have the package sent in your name and sign for the package if it becomes a controlled delivery." wtf??? Is this a typo? If I order a package that does not require a sig and someone is trying to get me to sign for it you advocate signing for the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am also surprised you advocate not writing "return to sender" on it because it "looks suspicious". Are you saying it's possible LE uses that against you in a court of law? How is that possible? They say to the judge or jury "look, this guy wrote return to sender on a package that was clearly addressed to him... isn't that weird judge?" Really? I had no idea something like that could be used against you. My thought was at best it does nothing but certainly there is no harm in writing it. Will you please reconfirm that the FAQ and conventional wisdom here on SR is incorrect?

    What if it is in the name of a business and more than one person has access to the businesses box? Please take for granted that the other person will not say anything and likely does not exist when providing your answer.

      Hi HJ
      <br/>
      Let's say someone from an European country sends a very small amount of a controlled substance like lsd to the US. The letter gets intercepted and police finds a fingerprint (from the sender). Will they run a check on fingerprints in their database? If so, are these fingerprints only from people who have already committed a crime or do they have the possibility to run a check on fingerprints of everyone who ever has entered the country?
      <br/>
      Many thanks.

     If the police ever find a fingerprint, there is no doubt they will run it through the national database.  Most of the fingerprints are from people who have been arrested in the past, but I think they also have some fingerprints of people who have or do work for the government.  I don't believe they have fingerprints from everyone who entered the country, but I don't know that for sure.  By the time I get a case, the police have already run any fingerprint evidence, so I'm not sure what all is in their database.  Most people don't understand how rare it is to find a useable fingerprint.  Shows like CSI make it sound like you can find fingerprints everywhere.  That is simply not the case.  Of course, you should take precautions, but the chances of finding a fingerprint are rare.  Less than 1% of all the cases I handled involved fingerprints.  In fact, I can't think of more than a few cases I handled in 13 years that had useable fingerprints and none of them were drug cases.

       What advice can you give to resellers here on SR. People who buy product on SR to resell that same product here on the road.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It seems, given what you've said so far, the main weakness is having the product shipped to you and if you're getting large quantities there is the potential for large issues. What precautions can be taken?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I think what typically happens is the reseller would setup a virtual office to have the mail delivered to that is either in his name, another persons name, or the name of a company setup for this purpose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do any of these options provide more or less protection than the other options providing said person is still picking up the delivery at some point?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Would having additional names or fictional people listed on the virtual office paperwork provide any protection since the reseller could potentially claim this other person ordered it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What would proper proceedure be? Does wirtting "return to sender" on the package and not opening it for a few days provide any protection at all?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I tried to outline all the options I know of. If you know of others or have any insightful information on this topic I'm sure a number of poeple would find it useful.
       <br/>

    How do you set up the VO?  Are you going to use a fake name?  It's my understanding that you need to give ID at most places like the UPS store.  Law enforcement would find out who the VO belongs to and they will investigate that person.  They could also stake out the place or get video from when you pick up the package.  They will be able to find out it is you that is getting the package.  If it's a fake business or name, that does not look good in court.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you go to pick up the package, you could be arrested.  Most likely, they would follow you and find out where you take the package.  They would then get a search warrant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You could refuse to sign for a package, but if it's addressed to you and you refuse to sign it, it looks suspicious.  Most people would sign for a package if it is addressed to them or someone in the house.  Not signing might stop them from searching your house that day, but it is not going to stop their investigation.  If you don't intend to have anymore drugs shipped or have them in your house after that day, then by all means don't sign for it.  If you refuse to sign for it, that will raise their suspicions and they will likely investigate further.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, if you right return to sender on an unopened package that is addressed to you, that will look strange to a judge or jury.  What good reason would you have for doing that?  If you do have a good reason, how will you get that into evidence?  Are you going to testify to the good reason?  That's not a good idea.  Obviously, this is my opinion and I can see why some people disagree, but I think it is better to just let it sit there and tell the police you have no idea who sent it and you don't know what it is.  At that point, say nothing else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have a package sent to a business and there is more than one person with access to the business box and that other person isn't going to say anything, then yes that can help.  However, if you are talking about using a fake business, they will find out that it is a fake business.  I understand in your scenario the other person won't talk, but that is a big risk.  Most drug cases are solved because someone talks.  Again, if you have a fake person who doesn't exist that has access to the box, they will figure this out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I said earlier, the best stories are the simplest stories.  When you start involving fake people and businesses, that will be used against you.  A jury is going to expect an explanation as to why you are signing for a package for someone who doesn't exist or they are going to want to know why you have a fake business.

    well though out plan however you ahve alot of links, and remmeber your only as strong as your weakest link. Too have so many people involved and not crack is miraculous. This doesnt even happen amongst the hardened mexican cartel members who have the fear of death to themselves and whole family hanging over their head.

    OP, thank you for taking the time to answer questions and offer advice.  This whole experiment in unregulated commerce is still pretty new, and the risk is not 100% clear, so the perspective of insiders who know the game is invaluable.  A few people like yourself have stopped by, and eventually get driven off by a barrage of inane questions and/or rude comments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I understand not everyone working in law enforcement is an evil anti-drug zealot; there's good laws and bad laws, and good cops and assholes just like every other group.  However, nobody in that business gets to choose which laws they like to enforce. Blame the politicians. (I do have a problem with the DEA and some of their their dirty pool tactics: abuse of forfeiture laws, inflating charges, and constant reliance on snitches who will say anything to stay out of jail, etc., but I guess that's how the game is played)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just have a few questions of my own, which reading this thread again I notice you have partly answered already, so feel free to focus on anything interesting:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would intercepting a package containing small amounts of scheduled drugs that are addressed to the occupant of a residence be enough evidence to charge someone if the occupant refused to answer questions and the sender was unknown?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's consider the same scenario, but a larger quantity of Schedule I is intercepted, the DEA gets involved, and a search warrant is obtained.  Upon executing the search, the package is found unopened. No other contraband is found, but a computer is seized; however, the hard drive is encrypted.  Could the occupant be compelled to reveal the passphrase by a judge in these circumstances, or could the accused plead the fifth? Would this be enough evidence to charge/indite in your opinion? How hard would it be to obtain a conviction under these circumstances? (I noticed you raised the possibility of long term surveillance for large amounts, that's a more complex scenario I guess.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just speculating, I know the US government has been studying SR for some time, what do you think might be their next move, assuming they don't defeat the cryptography side of things?  A sting operation on buyers to scare and set an example maybe, like prostitution stings?  Like you said, they usually care more about the dealers, but these appear to be the harder target, like you said.  Money trail maybe?  I fully expect some legislative attempt to regulate cryptocurrency will occur eventually...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally just for fun, is that HBO show The Wire an accurate portrayal of the drug war during that time period (early 2000s) ?  I just love that series, I think it is one of the few shows that attempts to show both sides.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, thanks to those who ask good questions, this is a really valuable and interesting thread.

    thats another question HJAnslinger. how often did you see case where nobody had talked and what was the likelyhood of prosecuting a case like this? of course i understand other strong evidence could completely void utter silence however you did mention the majority of the time your cases were based on somebody talking so i was wondering did anyone you prosecute ever get off because they/everyone kept their mouth shut? also how high was your conviction rate as a prosecutor? I understand if you dont wanna give exact numbers but is it 50/50 or something like 90/10 in the prosecutions favour?

     In my experience, the more simple the story is, the better.  Once you start adding layers, that gives them more things to look at.  If there are fake names, they will likely figure that out.  If there are real people, they will try to get them to turn on you.  My advice would be to have a clean house when you get a package.  Have the package sent in your name and sign for the package if it becomes a controlled delivery.

     One piece of advice I can give everyone is to never NEVER talk to the cops if you get busted.  They will act like they are your friend and they will tell you it will be better if you talk.  Sometimes you can get a better deal if you talk, but don't think for an instant that you have to talk right away.  You can always ask for a lawyer.  If you do have good info, then the cops can wait.  If people didn't talk, we would have solved a lot less cases.

    i dunno dude, the whole point of it is to show that you get legimate legal stuff sent to your house so it's not unusual for a parcel from the EU to be sitting on your desk in your name....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but then again, nothing beats the method of not saying a word and just let the cops do their work. At most all you should ever be saying, and purely just to relieve a bit of tension from yourself, is "I didn't order that package. I don't know who did. Anyone can ordered send anything in the post" and even that's probably too much.

    Just on that last post, what is HJAnslinger's advice in terms of what is the limit of what you should say to the police... The golden rule is don't talk, but getting put in an interview room can be a daunting experience for all but the toughest of nuts... how long can they keep you if you're just going to sit there in silence? and if they're really getting into your face then it's very tough and at some point most people are going to feel the need to say something, even if it's just to get some nerves out of the body.... If you were to crack is just flat out denying any knowledge of what they're talking about the way to go? Obviously admitting anything is fucking stupid in the extreme.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But say you pulled up in front of a judge and it's blatantly obvious you did something wrong, such as you've had a controlled delivery and you've signed for a package marked in a fake name. That looks extremely suss. Is denying any wrong doing in your police interview going to look worse or neutral to the judge (it's clearly not going to look better to him)...?

      we don't deal with anyone in our state all illegal order's are out of state.

      The items are in sealed undetectable air tight packaging again both  legal and illegal items.

      Payment comes from many places and people  through a tor e-commerce's web site we will take Credit cards, Moneypaks etc. This money's will be deposited in to a  us bank account opened buy the LLC company buy a lesion for said company This person does not exits fake id and fake face features and hair done buy a professionally hair and makeup artist. this would be a 1 time deal just to set up the account.

    I just wanted to add, I would not ask the OP specifically how to do something illegal. That is really asking him to stick his/her neck out, it's like you can't ask your attorney how to break the law, they could get disbarred for answering such questions.  Questions about process, tactics, or legal is fair game, though of course laws vary by location.

     <br/>
     Just speculating, I know the US government has been studying SR for some time, what do you think might be their next move, assuming they don't defeat the cryptography side of things?  A sting operation on buyers to scare and set an example maybe, like prostitution stings?  Like you said, they usually care more about the dealers, but these appear to be the harder target, like you said.  Money trail maybe?  I fully expect some legislative attempt to regulate cryptocurrency will occur eventually...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Finally just for fun, is that HBO show The Wire an accurate portrayal of the drug war during that time period (early 2000s) ?  I just love that series, I think it is one of the few shows that attempts to show both sides.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also, thanks to those who ask good questions, this is a really valuable and interesting thread.

    I don't think intercepting a package with a small amount of drugs addressed to the occupant of the residence is enough by itself by itself.  You would need more evidence.  If you didn't, it would be way too easy to set someone up by mailing them illegal drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Very interesting question on your second scenario.  I don't think the law is settled on that question.  I saw an appellate case recently that was going to deal with a similar issue, but I never saw what they decided.  I'm guessing the answer will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction until the US Supreme Court gets a case with that issue.  If they could force you to give your password, they might be able to get a conviction depending on what they could find on your computer.  I am definitely not a computer expert, so I don't know what they could find on there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless the DEA can figure out a way to shut down SR, I think they will try to make an example out of some buyers.  If they start busting a bunch of buyers and getting publicity, it might scare away a lot of potential customers.  I could see them setting up reverse buys where they are actually the ones selling the drugs through SR and busting the people when they make the delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I never watched The Wire.  I don't watch shows that deal with the law because they are almost always inaccurate.  I know some people I worked with that watched it and they said it was the most realistic crime show they had seen dealing with the "drug war" (not sure that makes it accurate, but it is better than most).

     thats another question HJAnslinger. how often did you see case where nobody had talked and what was the likelyhood of prosecuting a case like this? of course i understand other strong evidence could completely void utter silence however you did mention the majority of the time your cases were based on somebody talking so i was wondering did anyone you prosecute ever get off because they/everyone kept their mouth shut? also how high was your conviction rate as a prosecutor? I understand if you dont wanna give exact numbers but is it 50/50 or something like 90/10 in the prosecutions favour?

    If everyone kept their mouth shut, there's a good chance the case wouldn't even get referred to our office for prosecution.  The police don't send every case over for prosecution.  If we had a case where nobody talked, we would only file it with real good evidence.  In that case, we usually got a conviction.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We never kept track of our "conviction rate."  Those numbers are pretty easy to manipulate depending on how you define a conviction.  Some offices will plead down a serious case to a low level misdemeanor and count that as a conviction.  I have no doubt that well over 90% of the cases I prosecuted ended up with a conviction.  Most of the times people end up pleading guilty.  You don't have as many trials as they do on tv.

     Just on that last post, what is HJAnslinger's advice in terms of what is the limit of what you should say to the police... The golden rule is don't talk, but getting put in an interview room can be a daunting experience for all but the toughest of nuts... how long can they keep you if you're just going to sit there in silence? and if they're really getting into your face then it's very tough and at some point most people are going to feel the need to say something, even if it's just to get some nerves out of the body.... If you were to crack is just flat out denying any knowledge of what they're talking about the way to go? Obviously admitting anything is fucking stupid in the extreme.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But say you pulled up in front of a judge and it's blatantly obvious you did something wrong, such as you've had a controlled delivery and you've signed for a package marked in a fake name. That looks extremely suss. Is denying any wrong doing in your police interview going to look worse or neutral to the judge (it's clearly not going to look better to him)...?

    The easiest and quickest way to end an interrogation at the police station is to tell them that you want a lawyer.  If you are in custody and you tell them you want a lawyer, they have to stop asking you questions.  The key is you have to be in custody for this to apply.  The police don't have to read you your rights if you are not in custody.  You need to be absolutely clear that you want a lawyer.  Don't say "do you think I need a lawyer" or anything like that.  Tell them you do not want to talk AND you want a lawyer.  If you do that and they keep asking you questions, anything you say will be suppressed by the court.  A judge can't hold that against you and in my experience, they don't.

       and you and others are employer's of this company that ship's multiple items legal and illegal.

       <br/>
       we don't deal with anyone in our state all illegal order's are out of state.
       <br/>

       as employes can they be held accountable for what's inside the packages even though they real do have no idea whats in the packages.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The items are in sealed undetectable air tight packaging again both  legal and illegal items.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Payment comes from many places and people  through a tor e-commerce's web site we will take Credit cards, Moneypaks etc. This money's will be deposited in to a  us bank account opened buy the LLC company buy a lesion for said company This person does not exits fake id and fake face features and hair done buy a professionally hair and makeup artist. this would be a 1 time deal just to set up the account.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This fake ID person well add to the US bank account a purchasing manager that is hired in the same fashion as any other company.

       <br/>
       our shipping policy that we make our customers fallow and yes we would  make them buy the over sea's LLC company.

       <br/>
       only 2 packages a week per address never sign anything never sent in real name a fake name that we have subscription to as a joke gay mag's and other stuff fake bills from penny a cd type places so the address has past mail to that name.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Package is picked up at a VO type place a box but not a po box there is no signing 24/7 access so u can hide your face at night when getting the package for cameras only.

    My brain is hurting just trying to follow all of this.  I agree that you have too many people involved.  Even though you say you only have 2 people in the know, it sounds like you plan on having a lot of employees.  They could possibly figure out what is going on.  Way too complicated in my opinion.  Anytime there is more than one person involved, there is a chance someone will talk.  The only person you can be sure won't talk is yourself.  You should always assume that another person will talk and protect yourself as much as possible.

    Hi HJAnslinger,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for taking the time to answer our questions here. I have a couple about jurisdiction and interception process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If USPS in one state intercepts a SR package heading to another state, and the drug found is marijuana (personal amount weight; less than oz), what state's LE agency would be involved in deciding whether to pursue this matter?   Would the authorities from the state in which the package was intercepted contact the receiving state's authorities to let them decide whether they will pursue?  Or will this be up to the discretion of the federal authorities?  I mean since it's a federal crime to use the postal service to move drugs, would the feds be involved in deciding what to do and would be less inclined to pursue a case with just personal amount weight?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly, do you know how long is the process, once drugs have been detected by USPS, to get a warrant and to actually inspect the package?  If I receive my package in 3-5 days (which is expected delivery time coast to coast), is it nearly impossible that USPS and the authorities had the time to get a warrant, inspect and perform a controlled delivery?  Assuming, of course, that I wasn't previously on their radar and the package/I was a new occurrence to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks, again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a third question concerning civil forfeiture laws.  I know the application of this varies from state to state but how likely would it be for authorities to seize your home if you're receiving marijuana in personal amounts?  Would that make it more worthwhile for federal prosecutors to pursue a case?  Or even for local prosecutors. too?

    It's really awesome that you're doing this dude. I'm always happy to see recognize their wrongs and turn over a new leaf.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Let's say police bust down my door and say they have intercepted a package carrying drugs and addressed to me. Let's say the confiscate my laptop and see that I have Tor, not to mention a history of visiting the URL for the Silk Road. Can they require me to provide a username and password? If they can't, would this evidence alone be enough to convict me? I doubt it but I'd rather be sure. This is why I keep my house drug-free, the police will find nothing here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) I'm curious if you happen to know how many drug dealers were caught due to a financial mistake rather than a drug-dealing related mistake. For example, was anyone prosecuted because the IRS noticed they were making income that shouldn't exist? How much income would one have to make from drug dealing before the government took notice? Like if I were unemployed except for drug dealing, and also I rent an apartment with a few friends, would anyone come knocking eventually? I don't know if you'll know this, but figured I should ask.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers.

    My brother is a lawyer.  He says if they find a package with little amounts, they will toss it and maybe send you a letter saying WE FOUND CONTRABAND.  Big orders they have to do a Controlled Delivery(I'm living in a 3rd world country were a faggot owns the contrie.  We got the bet laws here,hear of amendments.  IF the seller ask for signature(I email them first ask them why should I sign.  In most cases they cant get around that.  OK if I order from somebody here no signature required, all od sudden I'm asked to sign, just say I did not order that. They might look at you weird or something but like I said THIS THE US not any country.  Also were are they going to link anything to you.  BITCOINS really cant find that shit out anyway.  Even so I.m using bitcoins to buy music, theres use for bitcoins.  Dont be a dumb citizen fall in these BS traps.

    Thanks, 'slinger. This has been very helpful for my homework efforts. Pretty interesting to get your professional perspective on these things. I appreciate the good questions others have posed, too. I think these issues are on a lot of our minds.

    Dr. Trabucco being the one busted?  Am I the only one that thinks the Dr. tidbit might give away a little too much info?  A quick Google search reveals his name and where he was prosecuted.  Wouldn't be too difficult to figure out which Bartholomew prosecutor you were if I happened to be one of your ex-peers that you say are not too fond of you.  Unless there have been a whole bunch of doctors indicted for ordering seeds in the manner you described.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a thought.  I would feel a little bad if you were publicly shamed for offering up nice advice, but hopefully I am way off.

      Hey,

      <br/>
      What is average sentence/punishment for a 1st time drug charge and 3 pounds of weed. I know it varies greatly, but just wondering if you have seen multiple pounds for 1 guy, and it was his 1st drug charge. Thanks

     Like you said, it varies greatly.  In my county, if the guy didn't have a criminal record, he's likely only going to get probation.  It might even get reduced to a misdemeanor if he doesn't get in trouble while on probation.  I can't remember any cases where we had pounds and it was the person's first drug charge.

    I just wanted to chime in here- I've been forced to deal with LE on a few seperate occasions... the first one, my home was raided, someone dressed in a FEDEX uniform came to my door, asked for me, and then a bunch of LE jumped out of a FEDEX van and forced their way into the home with weapons drawn.  I wasn't there... sucked for my room mate.  LE had a warrant and had been casing the place for some time.  A few things I learned from that experience are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. LE need to describe your home in great detail when asking for a warrant... there will be someone scoping out your place and writing things down like color, where doors are, license plates of cars parked outside, etc, a good deal of time before the warrant is ever approved or served.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Warrants have expiration dates and can only be executed during certain hours...  apparently it takes more work to have a warrant approved for execution in the middle of the night than for execution during normal hours.  I'm pretty sure LE won't execute a search warrant without special evidence in the wee hours of the morning
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the other experiences, I've learned that LE will arrest you even if they don't have appropriate evidence.  If there was contraband in a package delivered to my home and LE knew about it they would find some way to arrest me.  If there was a "controlled delivery" being executed on my residence, I highly doubt that the LE would decide that they couldn't arrest me because my I wouldn't sign for the package.  It's LE's job to get you into the back of a car, not to make the charges stick.  That's the prosecutors job.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One time I had LE knock on my door because a friend was caught with a DUI leaving my place.  LE asked me to step outside so we could talk, and as soon as I stepped foot outside they slapped cuffs on me for being under the influence.  Now I've learned never to answer the door when LE knocks.. you are not required to answer the door for ANYONE, even LE.  If I do answer the door, I will simply state that everything is OK here, I didn't call LE, they cannot come in, I will not step outside, thanks, goodbye.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most possesion of personal use amounts end up with a defferred entry of judgement, probation, and mandated treatment programs.  Even repeat offenders
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe the OP can validate some of my statements

    HJAnslinger-  I want to thank you for coming on to the road and offering your assistance.  The 'war on drugs' is indeed a fallacy and can't be won, but is profitable enough (even for law enforcement) that legality is a dream for now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Questions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.   I was wondering what was the technicality (or were there a few?) you saw most used by the defense to get a case thrown out of court or dismissed?  I.E. cops not reading rights, not letting client see lawyer before even though requested, search warrant issue...etc
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2.  Lets say that someone is caught 'red handed'.  No denying it, the evidence is there.  Of course the type of charges and evidence caught with will vary, but this is a General question.  Is there something an arrestee or suspect can do or say that can get the case thrown out or dismissed down the road?  It would be something not so conspicuous that the prosecutor or police would pick up on it and correct or fix the issue, or 'plug' the loophole; but something that a defendant can bring up at a later date that clearly would get the case dismissed, or a BIG reduction in charges?  Of course witness tampering comes to mind, but I am wondering if there is something the defendant themselves can do or say, so as to not rely on anyone else.

    He has pretty much given you all that you can do...  Any lawyer will tell you to know your rights, use them and be polite, ESPECIALLY when your rights are being abused.  You can't stop the cops from doing anything, so be polite but firm to not talk, refuse any searches, even if they search anyways.  The search will be thrown out in court.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He mentioned in an earlier post that to refuse to answer questions (shut your pie hole) and ask for a lawyer... He said that later any info gathered by further questioning was suppressed.  That is your best "catch".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you try and trip them up, you have to also prove it.  Will you have a recording of the conversation?  Probably not, then its your word against theirs that you laid the "trap".   Chances are you will let something slip that will lead them to something else etc, so shut your trap (reoccuring theme).  Even if questioning gets thrown out, cops/lawyers have legal back doors to get around them sometimes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He said it was over 50% but in most small cases admitting guilt/talking (anyone) is the #1 way of getting busted.  The cops will say they have fingerprints, internet traces, phone taps, GPS tracking, and Mosses' statement on the tablets to get you to fess up...  Most of the time it is a lie...  Shut your trap and spend your 24-48 hours in jail, wait to get released/lawyer-ed up and then figure out what to do/say.
    <br/>

    If they have you dead to rights, they won't drill you, cause they have you dead to rights already... get it?

        what if it's not a fake business but a LLC company from a bank that the US has no control over (Over sea's) totally untraceable
        <br/>
        <br/>
        and you and others are employer's of this company that ship's multiple items legal and illegal.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        we don't deal with anyone in our state all illegal order's are out of state.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        as employes can they be held accountable for what's inside the packages even though they real do have no idea whats in the packages.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The items are in sealed undetectable air tight packaging again both  legal and illegal items.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Payment comes from many places and people  through a tor e-commerce's web site we will take Credit cards, Moneypaks etc. This money's will be deposited in to a  us bank account opened buy the LLC company buy a lesion for said company This person does not exits fake id and fake face features and hair done buy a professionally hair and makeup artist. this would be a 1 time deal just to set up the account.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This fake ID person well add to the US bank account a purchasing manager that is hired in the same fashion as any other company.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Of course the manager is a trusted man that's in on the game.
        <br/>
        The fake ID person will be a "made" us citizen but will be from same country that LLC is from.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The money's will then be transferred to the over sea's bank account then you can take the money back out"at your leisure"with bank atm card at any ATM here in usa.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        our shipping policy that we make our customers fallow and yes we would  make them buy the over sea's LLC company.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        only 2 packages a week per address never sign anything never sent in real name a fake name that we have subscription to as a joke gay mag's and other stuff fake bills from penny a cd type places so the address has past mail to that name.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Package is picked up at a VO type place a box but not a po box there is no signing 24/7 access so u can hide your face at night when getting the package for cameras only.
        <br/>
        <br/>

       well though out plan however you ahve alot of links, and remmeber your only as strong as your weakest link. Too have so many people involved and not crack is miraculous. This doesnt even happen amongst the hardened mexican cartel members who have the fear of death to themselves and whole family hanging over their head.

      there are only 2 people in this that know what is really going on everybody else is just an min wage employee that has no clue who is in really in charge or whats is being mailed.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      and 1 of the two will never step foot in the door of the company where things are being mailed from he will be the one in the disguise the one that opened the US bank account

     My brain is hurting just trying to follow all of this.  I agree that you have too many people involved.  Even though you say you only have 2 people in the know, it sounds like you plan on having a lot of employees.  They could possibly figure out what is going on.  Way too complicated in my opinion.  Anytime there is more than one person involved, there is a chance someone will talk.  The only person you can be sure won't talk is yourself.  You should always assume that another person will talk and protect yourself as much as possible.

    No pun intended but that is the exact effect I was looking for I want your head to hurt when you look into my case as a prosecutor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway you look at it there will still be two people involved I.e. the person that went into the bank and set the account up With a disguise and the district manager who was hired by the man in disguise
    <br/>
    fully legitimately newspaper ad run Interview whole entire 9 yards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now yes the district manager is a player in this game and Knows exactly what is going on but is a highly trusted associate for many years and we have developed what we fill would be a surefire way of not getting convicted we do believe we will go to court but we also believe that we will win in court.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The way this is structured for him(District manager) to bring The( man in disguise) into the mix would be worse for his case
    <br/>
    <br/>
    that would be an admission of guilt to associating with the illegal part of the organization.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The district manager will receive a company check like all other employees he will even have health insurance benefits etc. etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    he will never deal with the product he will never be wihere the product is packaged
    <br/>
    The people that package the product do not know him and he does not know them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Product is packaged off-site And delivered In a fashion to look like a US Postal Service delivery
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of Course all deliveries will be made after employees have left or before they arrive
    <br/>
    <br/>
    deliveries will be mixed with legal products along with the illegal products ( product is medical marijuana)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like you said in many Of your post to Do not talk to the police that is what The very expensive On retainer lawyer is for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the employees  Will never have a clue what's in the stealth sealed packages
    <br/>
    <br/>
    takes 5 min. just to open one of the packages
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You guys Have seen them at the store's hard plastic formed to fit containers that are heat sealed and you need a butcher knife to open them I can buy one of these machines for around $900 the material comes in gigantic rolls $269 I have no clue how many containers I can make out of one of these 3 1/2 foot Circumference by 48 inch long rolls.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The product will be sealed inside of a container that will be sealed inside of Another  container that will be sealed inside the Hard plastic self forming containers.All Very pretty With labels barcodes Etc. etc. very professional looking
    <br/>
    just like you bought it at Walmart.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You would literally have to cut it open with a butcher knife then cut the other package open with same butcher knife then open the package the product is actually in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is an impossibility it will never happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Almost all mailrooms have surveillance cameras this one definitely will with big signs saying you are being watched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything is tied to an overseas company that is owned by an overseas individual that does not exist this overseas company uses a overseas bank that is in a country that does not allow US government access to their banking records....... I put a lot of periods for reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again the person who will actually go into the bank  in America and open up this LLC company legitimately Then have that bank on a daily basis Forward all proceeds not needed for daily operations to the overseas bank account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The person that opens up the legitimate LLC company in America does not Exist after setup of banking account this person will Drive across the Mexican border and catch a charter flight with Name used to open up LLC company he will charter that flight back to unnamed country where overseas bank account is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He will then undisguise himself Turn back into regular  American Fly to alternate country  can charter flight Again use fake US name and ID  again I have checked this is not Hollywood made Up you can very easily charter a flight from Overseas banking country  to the other country
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other country You will use to fly home In your real American name and passport. Of course this would be the starting point of where you flew out of the United States for a two week vacation hotel rooms jet ski rentals etc. etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did not say this would be cheap
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can purchase professionally made ID's along with a professional makeup artist to change characteristics of heritage in other words they going to make the person look like a south American. All of this is done in overseas bank country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All proceeds from this businesses will go to the Overseas bank account at this point the Money investigation would come to A screeching halt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even the employees when questioned Would point the finger to the manager(He knows nothing) when managers questioned he would point the finger to the district manager at this point the district manager would have already Called his very expensive  lawyer You know the one that's been on retainer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    negotiated a bank account with a overseas bank (Just to see what would happen) They will accept my American passport And you do not need a visa for this country
    <br/>
    <br/>
    grant you it is a risk Dealing with overseas banks but the bank that I'm dealing with has been in business since 1948 and is worth in the neighborhood of $23 billion I don't think they're going to ruin their reputation over little old me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've investigated this over and over And I will be honest with you I don't feel hundred percent on anything except opening up a overseas bank account this I know it's possible everything else 70%
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what loopholes are there where could the police department find out any information about where the money ends and I'm not sure if this is right or not but I would assume that Most drug cases evidence consists of a money Trail again I don't know if this is right or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I would assume hiding who the money Goes to would be a good start if they can't prove that the employees and the manager did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the illegal drugs this would be good for them in court if they even went to court.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and as for the district manager he has an overseas account also all of his American assets will be through his paycheck for the company which the company will pay him a standard rate for his job category.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the people receiving the packages are silk road like customers
    <br/>
    <br/>
    few major players But the majority Of our cells are 2 to 3 Ounces a month customers if not less.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    None of this is real gentleman I am just a business minded individual and all this is, off the top of my head I have researched what I've said I've researched but only as a hobby not taken any of it seriously yet           you notice I did say yet
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All of this is a fictitious lie perpetrated by a 12-year-old lying nose bleeding wimpy little kids who has never taken drugs a day in his life this is all complete bull shit lies and untruths innuendos and should not be taken seriously especially by the law enforcement agencies of the world
