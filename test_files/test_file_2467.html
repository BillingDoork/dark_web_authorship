    Please post your shipping times.So we get a reliable statistic.Please write also which postage option you used.
    <br/>
    If we have enough  informations we are able to predict trustworthy dates when our item will arrive.
    <br/>
    Everybody hate´s to wait for  post.(drugmail only, the rest is only bills)
    <br/>
    Hope we get a large pool of detailed information´s for international shipping standarts &amp; delivery times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example:   Canada to Germany 5 business days days (priority mail)  Letter or parcel ??  weight ?  Express or not ?

    I see this post didn't catch on.  I like it though.  As a new user, I tweak out far faster than I should.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ordered USA to USA; Priority mail; 2 days - Shipped Friday, received Monday; Letter  (seller waited a week to ship, so I initially thought it was 9 days in transit)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ordered USA to USA; First Class; 3 days - shipped Thurs, received Monday; Letter
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ordered USA to USA; First Class; 2 days - shipped Thurs, received Sat.; Letter
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ordered USA to USA; First Class; not received yet. Shipped June 9th (today is 21st).  I haven't given up hope yet.  Seller has already offered to reship.  I see on the board that some delayed orders do show up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope this helps.  I will update if my order shows and try to discern the cause of delay.

    phew  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Russia:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NL - 14-17 days,
    <br/>
    USA - 18 days,
    <br/>
    UK - none arrived,
    <br/>
    CAN - none arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW, vendors - any info on recent delivery time to Russia from countries, other than NL and US? Just estimate. One of the German vendors indicated 6 to 10 days. Anyone can confirm this?

    I'd like to know how long CAN to UK, normal(non express) letter?
    <br/>
    Canada Post says 4-7 business days, I just wonder if anyone had any real life shipping times, to give me a better idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NL to UK, priority letter, 3 days. This is quiet reliable as well!
