    Hello good people. I have a problem and need your advices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before a month I ordered a sample of weed from Netherlands to Sweden.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It didn't arrive and today I got a letter from the Swedish customs that said they seized it and found some cannabis inside. They want to hear from me about this matter. Off course I will deny any knowledge about this matter etc etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know it was a foolish idea to order from Netherlands but I did it anyway. During this month I have made some orders and all of them have arrived successfully. But my concern now is: I am safe to keep on ordering? I have got pretty much everything I want for the next 2-3 months and I want to make a final order for 1 gram of dmt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any comments about my future security? If any one lives in Sweden and have had similar situation I would like to hear your reaction.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take care and most of all be safe. ( I kind of failed in that.)
    <br/>

    That's obviously got that seizure recorded in a computer somewhere.  If you get another seizure then they are going to see you got more than one which is going to further draw their attention and potentially action.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm curious if the weed was packaged in a MBB (moisture barrier bag).  I'm assuming you didn't order very much weed so surprised they caught it unless the packaging was bad.

    Hi!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First of all, I'm not from Sweden.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I think that you'll be fine ordering your DMT. Your order was caught a long time ago, and you have been receiving after that. If your address would have been flagged somehow, I don't think you would have ever gotten those other shipments. And, I don't believe them dogs to be able to smell DMT, and if it's properly packed I'm sure you will have it, no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW, I hope (actually am sure) that you are not foolish enough to be revealing your true country here. I bet you are norwegian, or icelandic, or maybe finnish. I'm sure you know all the cops &amp; customs people in the world are reading these forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Love to you!

    This is just me but even upon receiving a letter like that I would still ignore it.  In general, the more time that passes the better.  That's just my perspective though.

    Well not calling them back isn't a choice, since the law here follows every single letter and they will come to me if I don't. Pretty sure about that. I will think about it a bit more and will make my move soon. Have a solution already but need my time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Two last general comments I want to share.
    <br/>
    First of all I find it at least ridiculous that I am being "chased" for a gram of grass... Really makes me think again a lot about the system we are living in, how fair it is and how free is our "developed" society. Such a placebo...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And lastly. I happen to live in a country that have maybe the strictest drug policy. It is really freaky strict. But that's not what I want to say. My point is that because of this, I always had this personal "rule", never order from Netherlands. I knew our customs are very strict especially for letters coming from Netherlands.
    <br/>
    But... I did this to myself, forgot my basic rule just for 1 gram of free weed and now I ruined my safety...

    If you really are in Scandinavia then do they really have the strictest drug policy?  The US will lock us up for 3-5 years for as little as 10g of MDMA in some states.  In Singapore the punishments are even worse.

    Well, the longer I live, and the wiser I get, the more I want to NOT have  anything to do with my government. They think (at least that's what they tell people) they are there for me, they take care of me, they are me. They are WRONG! They are doing so so so many bad things to people who have done no harm to anyone, that I really don't want to be a part of their system any more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But how to resign?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can't do that, so I must fight back with the little possibilities I have. I make my living making people happy - providing them with the goods they want, but can't legally obtain. I am not with or in the system. I am an outlaw. I try to have as little as possible interaction with The Man as I can. I have my friends and family that I care for, and I try my best to do them good. But the government ain't gonna get a penny from me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ugh!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    //
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Back to the topic:
    <br/>
    I wouldn't ignore the letter. That is NOT what an Innocent Citizen would do. You need to act as regular as you can, and in my opinion that means calling the customs fuckers right away and demanding an answer to this nonsense. You are a law abiding citizen who votes for your-party-in-charge and you will not have it when someone sets you up like this. The government must act and save you from the drug dealing scumbags that are trying to smuggle illegalities to the country _in _your_name_! They must be punished! They are trying to get horrible, dangerous drugs in your country! Someone please think of the children and ACT!

    It was a new vendor. Or not so old. He had MBB package but I guess that wasn't enough. I am also a member Scandinavian underground forum and they said that every single letter coming from Netherlands is putting under the "eye".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the strictness, let me just tell you some "funny" facts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The police can anytime force you to take a drug test. (I don't know if that applies in other counties). The fine of a positive test is HUGE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A pedophile and a murderer will have a smaller punishment from someone someone accused for dealing class 1 drugs. Now, how much is the amount of dealing I don't know. But if you get busted with 10g of MDMA... I don't know, I guess you are fucked...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before some years, the Scandinavian countries decided to cooperate politically and economically but socially they are completely different.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Denmark is the "free and happy" nation focusing in arts, human liberties and expression. Drugs are illegal but you can find them easily and the police can "close" their eyes many times. Plus they have Christiania.... :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Norway is the money making country. They focus on employment and they are doing a pretty good job there. As for drugs? Strict customs but inside the country drugs flows on the street in huge amounts. The police doesn't care so much. In Oslo you can find anything within minutes. Plus, after an incident happened to a girlfriend of mine when we was there visiting, street dealers of Oslo have my respect. My gf goes and try to buy some weed on the street and the dealer asks for an ID! He didn't want to give weed to people who looks young before checking they are over 18! That's morality! I gave him a big tip because of that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sweden on the other way.. They lost it completely. Their politicians focused on being conservative in a very negative way. And people didn't react anyhow on these changes. They completely follow the rules and laws, they brought heavy drug policies, government controls all alcohol and the social revolutionary spirit have reached zero if not minus... Bars, clubs and everything closes at 2 clock (not in all cities thought, some keep them until 3...) It is true that Sweden has the ideal social infrastructure, everything "works" but honestly people here are robots.. Smiley and kind people but still robots... They even don't allow themselves to take a glass of drink during the week because they work the next day and it isn't  an "appropriate" act. And I have seen this a lot! My main passion and profession is cultural and social journalism and the Swedish culture was something I wanted to discover and research. I don't like to talk in general terms but in case of Sweden the main routine of a Swedish person is sadly simple. Work, television and social media during the week. TV is a big deal here and that is one of the reason that the Swedes talk the best English in Europe. They know everything about tv programs, series and films. And then comes the weekend. Let the party begin. Before fest preparations, heavy drinking, then out  for some more. By 1 o clock midnight everyone is really drunk! I have partied a lot in many EU countries, but here in Sweden I have this feeling that after 12 I am amongst zombies. They drink a lot and sooo fast and they choose to do it this way consciously... It is a common thing for them to say. "Can't wait for the weekend to get smashed from alcohol"...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I came here after some long journeys around Europe and stayed for the working opportunities and their ladies. But now I am really thinking what I am doing here... Haven't seen this kind of society and system anywhere in Europe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't know why I wrote all this... Swedes are good and harmless people. Too harmless should I say :)

    Good night...

    Your story sounds so familiar to me! I live in Finland and I know we have similar customs. For all Scandinavian ppl: Never ever order illegal stuff from the NL!

     . My gf goes and try to buy some weed on the street and the dealer asks for an ID! He didn't want to give weed to people who looks young before checking they are over 18! That's morality! I gave him a big tip because of that.

    Im bit worried at the moment. I have made one order before from NL and nothing came(not even letter from customs) and now have another order from there. Im from Finland like Buho and i know very well it's risk to order from NL to here, but the product that im looking for is hard to find anywhere. Is there any products that pass easier than others or does the quality of stealth play big role here? I still should be more careful and hope this transaction comes.

    I would say that you should not buy anything from NL. At least our customs search ALL letters coming from there.
    <br/>
    And as for the letter from customs mine came after 30+ days after they seized my letter. So if you are going to have a letter from the customs don't expect it soon. They need some time to make a full detailed research about the substance they have siezed and find out what it is, the potency etc etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    May I ask what you wanted to order and could find it only from NL? I believe everything can be found elsewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take care my friend.

    I ordered GHB. First one was powder, that didn't arrive and now liquid from different vendor. I dont think i can cancel the order any more since it's already been transit for a while. I know there is few other GHB vendors as well, but i read from vendors feedback that someone from Sweden had received their order. That motivated me to do order. And i have received after my none-arrived- orders one order from other country, so at my address is not "flagged"(maybe). Maybe still not the smartest motivator to buy from country that is closest.

    You should write them a complaint that you didn't get your drugs and now you can't get high.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take them to court to make them pay you for damages and compensation
