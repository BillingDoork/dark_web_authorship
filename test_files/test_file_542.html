    I live in a condominium - it's one big condo with units, not separated buildings - think of a hotel, as that's what everyone who visits me says my building is like. We have a mailroom where all USPS mail goes that will fit in the mailbox. If it doesn't fit in the mailbox, or it's a UPS/FedEx package, it gets signed for by a concierge in the front lobby/office. Once they sign for it, we get a notification that there's a package for us and we can go down and pick it up. If the package is signed for by the concierge, we have to sign for it for them to release it to us, whether the package required a signature or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking about making my first purchase soon and I'm wondering what you guys think of this scenario as far as what I should or shouldn't do. It seems like I'll have a bit of warning should it come down to a controlled delivery. They never deliver a package to our units directly - we ALWAYS have to come get it, so if someone with a package shows up at my door, I'll immediately know something's up through the peephole. Plus, I seriously doubt LE is going to sit in the front lobby all day waiting for me to come get a package.

    I delivered 50 caps to a condo in early 2002.
    <br/>
    Some fucker signed for them and took off.
    <br/>
    I was and never have been a dealer, just had a contact and helped someone out.
    <br/>
    Just be careful and make sure YOU sign for it because you said 'us' before. ;)

    Good catch - the 'us' would be me and the wife. :)

    Yeah there's no way anyone else can sign for it but the concierge, so interception (other than LE) is pretty much impossible.

    Thanks for the replies!
