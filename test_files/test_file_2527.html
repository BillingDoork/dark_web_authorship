    Hi! New here--
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Safe to ship suboxone strips to a dorm? I'm going to assume that's probably the "safest" thing to ship-- do drug dogs usually sniff that out? I'm wanting to buy 3-5 strips, and I think most vendors just use mail envelopes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!
    <br/>

    How are your mailboxes setup? Our old dorm, each person had their own that opened with a locker combination. As long as the strips arent hanging out of the package, you should be fine. But even if they were, no one would bother it unless they knew what it was. Then ud only have to worry about it getting stolen. You wont have to worry about the head person at the dorms giving you any trouble about it.

    right, locker combination box! awesome.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so last bit here-- is buprenorphine usually something drug dogs even search for? I know I have to assume the risk, but is suboxone is pretty under-the-radar still?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also thanks tons guys, especially for the fast responses. still trying to get my feet wet here.Â  :D

    no, dogs shouldnt be trained to alert to bup or naloxone
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but in the rare case something should happen like a ripped envelope or some how being found out the consequences would be especially severe
    <br/>
    <br/>
    instead of just a confiscation as would happen for others - you would almost certainly be kicked out of your dorm minimum, or even from school
    <br/>
    <br/>
    make sure you weigh the risk with the benefit
    <br/>
    <br/>
    subs could definitely be worth the risk depending on your situation (from an opi addict)
