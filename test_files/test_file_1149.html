    Sent package/letter, a very small thin one to Australia and it has failed to turn up according to the buyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have sent more than 100 similar letters in past year worldwide and over 20 to Australia, this is the first that has failed to turn up, it's nearly 6 weeks now since it was sent.  It was sent from S.E Asia, but the interesting thing is, it was sent registered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The tracking for this country is useless and it only says it has left country of origin, no updates since, but then thats quite normal on ones that arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone here just had registered letters not turn up or get lost.  It had 0.25g of heroin in it, but it was good stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they had found that wouldnt they send a letter?

    Doubt they would bother sending a letter for .25 of Heroin.

    How trustworthy is your customer?

    Try checking your tracking number through AusPost? it may offer more details, obviously don't check it through Tor or your own IP.

    Australian customs do not send love letters for illicit drugs they only send them for controlled substances
    <br/>
    if the tracking does not update and says it has left country of origin its been seized

    i have had a few letters not turn up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    realistically there could be a few reasons:
    <br/>
    vendor never sent it
    <br/>
    got picked up before origin country
    <br/>
    got picked up in oz by customs
    <br/>
    it got lost in transit ( can happen)
    <br/>
    wrong address on the letter
    <br/>
    registered post seems to get a closer inspection,stick to regular
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you trust the vendor, then take your pick from the others listed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just be sure not to send to that address again to be on the safe side.
