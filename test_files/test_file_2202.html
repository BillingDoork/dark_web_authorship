    Dealer still in contact. My order of LSD almost autofinalized. I gave him a date extension because he has 100% rating. I havnt gotten any indication that its been stopped or seized. I havnt gotten any mail the past two days which is unusual for my house. I'm getting nervous. What advice do you have?

    Wait 2-3 more days by that time there should be mail.. normally.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If by then still no mail has come to your house something fishy is going on, maybe the mailmen are on strike?

    Act like it's suspicious, even if it may be nothing. Always be prepared for the worst, never let your guard down. Make sure your entire house is clean and you're mentally ready to say nothing at all, under any kind of circumstances. Not until you have a lawyer out on your behalf. Because you have absolutely no idea whats going on, this is all utterly news to you.

    Give it a few days, a couple others i've seen have posted that they haven't gotten any mail for a few days just because the cutbacks.

    It can sometimes take a long time to get international packages. I've purchased stuff from Germany, Thailand, U.K., etc...and have had some of them get here in 7-10 days and I've had some take a little over a month due to getting stuck in customs (which sometimes can be REALLY backed up). Hopefully you receive your package soon!

    I would be patient LSD is hard to get nailed on and frankly international shipping to USA can take 14-17 days sometimes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also the way the SR system is set up once seller hits send doesnt mean the post office hit sent. I mean if he shipped from Bovaria and the air mail all goes to Frankfurt you could lose 4 days right there, but on SR it says shipped so you start counting days when it still has not even left germany,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldnt worry if you have a credible supplier I would say 99.5% it will arrive soon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But you should have a clean house and a clean mind just in case, lawyer on speed dial if necessary,
