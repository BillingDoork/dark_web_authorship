    A friend is opening a PO box soon for the purpose of receiving orders from SR, I was wondering if there are precautions he should take before ordering to the box or any other information I could give him in regards to this. I've been receiving packages for a few months with no problems but PO boxes could be different and I'm not sure. Thanks

    If a shipping was sent with decent stealth and well sealed can arrive everywhere in the world, but  as said, always was much more suspicious receive a package from overseas in a PO box than in a house.

    Bad idea. If you fake the name you're facing a lot more serious charge than drug possession. Just have all your mail shipped to PO Box for plausible deniability with your real name.

    maybe. don´t know well how work all the postal services at global level, but at least in european countries for domestic orders there are no customs, so if was seized, have to be very badly sealed (weed for example) or a very shitty package. with this i mean that mailman or the post office workers have smell or seen something enough suspicious to call the cops to seize it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and i said maybe because dont know if on Australia, Sweden and those kind of high risk of smuggle countries have an special customs for domestic orders too.

    I would challenge that assumption as it goes. Here in Australia you need two forms of ID including a photo ID to open a PO box therefore it stands to reason that the chances of linking the rightful owner of the PO Box to an intercepted order is much greater than if something is just sent to a residential address given you can just say "I have no idea who sent that and it's definitely nothing to do with me". So I therefore fail to see the link between a PO box being more risky and attracting more attention, why would that be?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Opening a PO box with fake credentials obviously increases your potential list of charges if you were to get caught using it or linked to it, therefore many people do not take the chance and just run with ordering to residential addresses including their home, which is if you ask me something that is far more risky than using an anonymous PO box not linked to you i.e. opened with fake documents. Sure the penalties are harsher if caught but the chances of getting caught are also much lower as you sever the link between you and the order. As will all things SR related it comes down to risk vrs reward, understand the potential penalties of the actions you are taking and make an informed decision based upon what you consider is acceptable or otherwise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Something to think about.

    Opening a PO box really isn't that different than having stuff going to ur house. I chose several PO boxes setup by several, well compensated friends to purchase boxes and hand over the keys.
    <br/>
    I don't want anything going to my house because with a PO box i can pick up the package when i want, the damn neighbors kids arent gonna steal my boxes like they did with some at and t phones i have ordered before, i can usually see where the cops and possible undercovers might be. I usually wait til nighttime to pick up deliverys.
    <br/>
    Every now and then I will go during the day to pick up a few blotters from a vendor i have faith in, when i do this i act like im dropping something off inside to be mailed or act like i forgot my key if someone is in the hallway that isnt a sweet old lady.
    <br/>
    I have ordered quite a few qps of weed and shrooms that came in large packages before. I wait for nighttime on these. They have a key in the po box that you use to open the larger boxes that are usually located closer to the beginning of the hallway. you simply use a glove or your shirt to grab the key and open the box.
    <br/>
    I am an avid ebay user! Believe it or not I have had several sketchy looking ebay packages arrive that just pissed me off! Written addresses, HUGE amounts of tape, stamps, used packaging!
    <br/>
    The key is to be consistent with legal and illegal deliverys, research and only purchase from reputable vendors, iveonly had 1 delivery from OS and that was a few LSD tabs from a bordering country.
    <br/>
    A po box is dangerous as well, there is a huge reduction in plausible deniability, your probably on camera,(my po boxes dont have lobby surveillance!),i get at least one package a week(legal and/or illegal), But what it all boils down to is: Do you have a FTW attitude required to walk into that PO and pick up the 500 grams of methylone or qp of weed waiting for you? I do.
    <br/>
    You also dont need to think about what you DONT want to happen, you should focus on what you do Want to happen. Its called the Law of Attraction. I ate some all seeing shivas about two hours ago. I love SR!

    This thread has peaked my interest again in using a PO box. So far, I've ordered to a residential address and everything has gone fine. I am not against getting some fake dox and opening up a local box, though. My lobby isnt recorded so thats another plus. I might even opt out for the next city over if i choose to do so. My only question is how do you know when you've got a delivery waiting in your box? I tend to check the mail box that I use frequently when I know there is a package on its way. I don't want to end up being "that guy" at the local post offices coming in 3+ times per week to leave with nothing.

     This thread has peaked my interest again in using a PO box. So far, I've ordered to a residential address and everything has gone fine. I am not against getting some fake dox and opening up a local box, though. My lobby isnt recorded so thats another plus. I might even opt out for the next city over if i choose to do so. My only question is how do you know when you've got a delivery waiting in your box? I tend to check the mail box that I use frequently when I know there is a package on its way. I don't want to end up being "that guy" at the local post offices coming in 3+ times per week to leave with nothing.

    There is no way to know.

    Easy solution: Sign up to heaps of random junk mail so you always walk out with something. OR send yourself official looking packages every few days so you can always walk out with something. OR just be patient and only check it once a week.

    and if you are in Oz get a PAYG anonymous burner and when you open the box pay the extra for the 'you have got mail option' and they will text you when your order arrives  :)

    anyone know a document that would work for the second form of ID required? They need one picture ID and one document without a picture that proves you live at your address and mail doesn't work. I don't have any bills either.

    Check the forgeries section. There has to be something there. I think I've seen utility bills and things of that nature.

    By the way where are you located (country)?

    These are both some pretty good ideas...I think patience is out the door; as much as I'd like to try it, it's not my strong suit. Especially when it comes to SR purchases...I'll have to look into my local PO and see if they offer that option...I can get a burner easily; I'll just need to take a trip to forgeries and try to grab an ID and just create some fake mail myself. Thanks, guys
