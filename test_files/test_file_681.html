    It's been a month since an envelope from Europe was shipped; at this point I'm considering it a loss.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have however NOT received a seizure notice. How long does it take these to get processed and sent?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it normal to not hear anything for an extended period of time?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I have a couple packages that seem to be taking a long time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does my address receive additional scrutiny if and when I have something seized?

    I wouldn't worry about it.  Unless you were expecting a kilo of coke or a couple of pounds of smoke, it probably just got lost in the system or pulled before it reached the US.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have ordered from the EU several times.  I have been waiting over 6 weeks for a letter that hasn't arrived.  In that time I received a second order from the same seller without any problem.  Two orders, one resend and I only have one letter so far.  I'm disappointed, but not really worried about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either they were taken by some light fingered posties across the pond, they are still on the way, or they were seized but because they are in the EU, they couldn't be bothered to send a letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, if it had been seized by the USPS you should eventually get a letter saying they have something of yours (usually saying they cannot identify the substance and won't you please come down and help them out).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As stated before, ignore the letter, deny, deny, deny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The chances of them watching your mail because the intercepted one piece of contraband is pretty low.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, as I have seen said many times, take a puff, flip on the tube, and relax.
    <br/>

    I've been waiting on an order for at least 3 weeks, going on 4 now at least (from over seas). It can take them 4-6 weeks to send a love letter. They usually will send you something along the lines of "We found a substance that we cant identify or have determined it to a be unlawful, you have X amount of days to contest this" more or less, that's, what a love letter says.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have only received one in the last 20 years and I just didn't respond to it.. Unless you ordered something that  is 100 percent legal and they must of made a mistake, then I would leave it alone...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best advice. Let it go when/if you receive that letter and never sign for anything that would be considered illegal..

    I haven't gotten a "love letter" for about 4 years, but back when I got one it was a regular letter in a regular envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe someone who has received one more recently can hep this young man put his mind at ease? :)

    I have heard from other people recently that it takes about 4-6 weeks to get a seizure letter. Also,  the last person that I spoke with that received a love letter (within the last year) said it was a regular envelope with a letter inside...
