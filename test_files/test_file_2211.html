    Just a quick question, due to new package "screening" techniques, people sending say "herb" from the west coast of USA  to the East are potentially flagged if its person to person. My question is, is it possible to mail "said product" under a business name that i do not own, for added safety? Business's are ALOT less likely to be flagged at all. For instance, is it possible to send a package from say sender " Joe Shmoe Car Wash Inc" to recieve " Sandy Shminkler" even tho i do not own the car wash personally? Or do some types of mailing procedures come into play such as "mail forwarding" Sorry for my lack of knowledge of USA domestic shipping policies
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help would be appreciated.
    <br/>

    There is a bit of a fine line that no one has any real real info on. Private correspondence via USPS. A letter from John Doe to Jane Doe is considered "private" and could not be opened or searched without a warrant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However according to the USPS website (dont make me look for the link, its late) "business correspondence" do not fall under this law.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now does that mean "bulk mail" or anything with a business name as a return address? No one (with proof) is really sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My opinion? send it person to person. There is LOTS of ebay mail floating around this country. double/triple vac pack.

    I don't think using a smaller business name would be bad, but if it is done, make sure you use printed return and shipping address labels.  If you hand write "ABC Company International Headquarters" as the return address, it will not look very legitimate.  Make it look professional.

    ??? I dont quite know how to respond to that, seems like you might wanna look into the "Ritalin" vendors...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't see how at all this is a stupid question? As i said i am not familiar with US domestic shipping policies.
    <br/>
    If a question like this makes you think someone is a cop lol i wonder what happens when your mom asks if you want cheerio's for breakfast.
    <br/>

    @ shroom and peels  Thanks you for the help I appreciate it

    ...seriously?...easy to answer question? ok then i challenge you please go on the website and find me this information there, id love to see you do this because I have looked. I think you may be miss understanding my question in the first place lmao why on earth would usps every explain or answer what i asked, on there website lol? seriously?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please find this information for me that you claim is so "access-able " on here, yes I admit i havent search these forums fluently but I highly doubt someone has proposed the same question. I dont understand why people on forums are so quick to complain to someone saying "oh look it  up" "meh it on the forums already"(some 20 pages deep) when its 100x easier to simply answer the question, Idk about you but time is my money and you know how to waste it thats for sure =D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, just to edit--- how is asking a "group" of people a packaging question IN ANY WAY personal? You might want to look that definition up.(seriously please look it up for your own wealth of knowledge)

    haha damn ? do u want me serve your cherrios too ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im just saying the questions make u look like you gathering data bro.. and if u have these types of questions ask the vendor you think of using.. like that u overstand the process
    <br/>
    <br/>
    other than that learn how to use a search bar correctly , cuz you will not get results just typing into the Search bar unless you selected the right forum section your in
    <br/>
    <br/>
    learn alot before you ask questions.. trust me.. oh and +1 for being a questioner lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    heres a good place to start.. its on clearnet :
    <br/>
    http://about.usps.com/what-we-are-doing/securing-the-mail/welcome.htm
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and heres another on how to label mail and what they look for to send the quickest without having a bunch of hands touch your parcels

    I love cheerios =] .. but seriously... your making no sense the point of asking a question IS to gather data lol? And hmm maybe i would think of asking a vendor IF i was purchasing from one and wanted them to do what i asked about???? I was asking for my own knowledge, I am not a yet Vendor on SR because as i've stated i am new, ive used another site that many probly also use for years but doesnt offer a forum based community...sue me for trying to get new ideas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And no part of that link answers my question..?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All you have done is waste time and appear to be tweaking..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im locking the topic because My question has already been answered by actual helpful providers to this community to which i thank..
