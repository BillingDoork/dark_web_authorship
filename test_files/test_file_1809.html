    Ok so I had JUST used SR for the FIRST fucking time. My first 6 orders were in transit when this happened. They were small personal amounts and I used PGP to encrypt my address EVERY TIME. What do you guys think, now that SR was seized they will be keeping a closer watch on the mail, right? I wonder how many of us will wind up with CD's now?? I'm pretty sure my little personal amount orders aren't enough for them to come after me, but I'm still really nervous. FUCK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S. Does anyone else think it's odd that this happened right after the government shut down? Crazy. I think we better all buckle down, something brewing and it's not gonna be pretty. Anyone else read about the FEMA camps? Yeah shit's really gettin real now.

    if the vendor actual marks them intransit when there mailed, then you should be fine. no need to worry and you used PGP just be glad you got to make 6 orders on the best thing the government ever fucked up.

    it a shame , everything DPR fought against finally came back to bite him, and there are many things saying some BS about a murder charge or some fake ID shit, clearly this was the work of a rat, someone close to DPR and knew things of him and about him and than screwed him, im sure most ppl will be ok, but the one who

    is responsible for day in and out keeping the site up is now behind bars.....if only there was a way to rally up and help him out

    I am expecting close to 4 packages, 1 was shipped first class on monday and for the other 3 were shipped priority on tuesday and 1 first class but still no package :/ had 2 samples processing that never shipped out I believe.

    <br/>
    I used PGP for all my orders but what really had me sketching was when I saw LE by my dropbox yesterday when DPR got pinched.

    Hoping these packages start arriving soon, hope for the best!

    I ALWAYS used PGP. It's funny actually cause the day before the shut down I ALMOST sent out my address in clear text for a sample, but I decided it wasn't worth it because the vendor didn't use PGP.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh and update on my orders: I finally received my first order today, just a couple hits of some blotter 25i. Still waiting on 4 others, one was a sample I had FE'd for so I'm expecting at least that to come. I think three of them were sent out priority on Monday, here's hoping our vendors weren't bullshitting when they marked in transit!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck to everyone as far as LE is concerned. If you're nervous, just remember what I keep telling myself to stay calm: Even if you didn't encrypt your address (which I hope you did!) LE has WAY bigger fish to fry right now than busting a couple people for recreational amounts. True, I'm sure some of us will unfortunately have to deal with CD's, etc., however I think for the most part they're after the vendors and buyers of larger quantities.

    What will happen? The postal services in various countries will deliver them, and we'll pick them up, as per usual. There's no magical increase in LE resources to do some big worldwide bust of letters in the mail, think about it for a minute.

    UPDATE: One of my last SR orders should be arriving tomorrow. The vendor was kind enough to contact me and let me know they had been tracking it and that it should arrive today or tomorrow. Luckily this was the only order I had ever FE'd for, so at least the vendor did get the payment. Glad of that. I've got at least 2 or 3 more I'm still waiting on, one of which I ordered 2 weeks ago but it was first class so who knows...
    <br/>

    I'll feel so much better once everything has either arrived or enough time has passed so I know it's just not coming.

    Since a lot of people have been paranoid about this, I thought I'd chime in and mention that a package I ordered right before the shutdown arrived without incident today. I just feel bad that I can't release the funds to the seller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A lot of people have been worried because they happened not to get mail the past couple days, thinking--"Shit, the government must be behind that." I understand the fear given all that has happened, but let's not be paranoid about the government's capabilities. They don't suddenly have your identity and aren't holding all of your mail for search. While you should take all the usual precautions against a controlled delivery, everything is likely fine.

    By the way, a friend I introduced to Silk Road just received a gram of heroin that she ordered without using PGP (even though I warned her repeatedly to ALWAYS use it). No controlled delivery or anything like that, just a bunch of high quality dope. Even though the cops can most likely (but not necessarily) see those addresses, it seems like they haven't been bothering going after small time users. It would be hard for them to justify the cost of a raid to their superiors as their budgets are limited and the drugs might not even be at the shipping address anymore.

    Thanks for quelling our fears. Yeah I'm honestly more worried about NOT getting my order at all than the cops being involved. I had over $100 in escrow, which is a lot to me. Even Priority mail takes FOREVER to get to me so hopefully it's still on its way.

    so did all you guys receive your packages?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recieved 2 priority that was shipped 10/1, however two first class packages have yet to arrive which has me kind of sketched out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One was from a completely new vendor offering a special sale and the other from an established vendor. I can only think of a couple variables of why this may of happened. Either the vendors never shipped although one claimed he sent out my first class package on 10/1 and the other the following day before the seize. Worst case scenario is that my dropbox has been compromised and I'm left with no choice but to switch locations. I do have some product coming to this drop from another site and if that package doesn't show then I can confirm the dropbox has been compromised, especially given the increased LE activity at the local post office. or perhaps the post is just working really slow as always.

    Ugh, and all I want is some concentrates :/

    I got a priority order that was sent 09/30 or 10/01 on 10/07 (this Monday). Mail takes FOREVER around here. I got a first class order from SR that was supposedly shipped 09/22 or 23 FINALLY on 10/04, postmarked 09/30 so obviously the vendor just took awhile to ship. Still had at least 3 other orders in transit. One I totally gave up on awhile back, another priority order made late night 09/29 I've determined must never have been shipped.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm still holding out every ounce of hope that a slightly larger first class order I made the same night, 09/29, that was supposedly sent the next morning, 09/30, is still on its way and is just taking a little longer than usual... I had messaged the vendor that night BEFORE ordering explaining that I really needed the order for the weekend. He assured me he'd ship it out first thing next morning, so hopefully worst case scenario it was shipped Tuesday, 10/02. Only comfort to me is that first class can at times take up to two weeks, so I'm hoping it's just stuck in the pipes somewhere and will arrive one of these days soon... :(
