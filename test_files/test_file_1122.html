    iv noticed recently a huge amount of noobs who , out of fear of getting ripped off,

    continue to write "...... 'FE' because im in 'insert country'....." in the feedback lists.
    <br/>

    Indeed, as far as FEing is involved (possible controlled deliveries). However, no wrong in doing so when the order has been received. It's very hard to know from the feedback who ordered since no username appears.

    <br/>
    for all those who write 'FE - blah blah' can I ask a favour? when you FE for a vendor don't enter a score or leave the written feedback. Just leave it blank and close the tab or navigate away and it will sit in your orders section on your account ready to be filled in when there all is said and done. This way we can all get to the feedback that is an actual report of the outcome rather than pages of FE... FE.... FE!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Besides we don't know who you are so telling us your taking a gamble/doing the right thing/whatever the reason is... Well, Its fairly pointless at best but TBH the reality is its actually really annoying. I don't go "Oh what a champ for doing that" or "Wow that guy is looking after the vendor. What a champ" when I'm going through page after page of them.... its more like "Oh FFS... I don't care you wouldn't normally do this and/or you really hope it arrives... I mean well DUH... II don't believe you will actually come back and update too BTW.. why lie like that? I've done nothing against you..." ;-p
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also can you really finalize early on a lottery like this? really the transaction is complete once the number is sent to you as its that number you are buying.. so really it was just 'F(inalized) Lottery ' or something like this. Just saying is all"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't leave any comment when FE is required! Not even a blank or 'leave feedback here' one. Just click the finalise button and navigate away from the page that has the score and text box. When the order arrives (or not) go back into orders and it will still be there waiting for your pearls of wisdom and high level of long term drug knowledge to be passed along to all the anonymous people buying their drugs on the anonymous market.... on the hidden service.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I disagree with the OP. Tell us your Country AFTER it has arrived so we know who is good where and it also gives a more transparent way to determine success rate beyond the stock vendor statementÂ  'we have a high success rate' heh ever asked a dealer what their gear is like? 99% of the time that are going to tell you its good.. 'Oh man nah don't but it from me I have shit gear' has never passed the lips of any dealer I know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the idea that there is a chance of a CD when a FE message includes the country... well actually I don't know where to start with why that is wrong... so wrong... Well I guess I can sum up my view point by saying its an anonymous comment on an anonymous market that is a hidden service on the dark net protected by tor... The LEO that can look at a FE statement and know that its you posting, manages to intercept the exact package then CD you without having already had a fair amount of Intel on you as an individual... well they should be working for the code breakers of the CIA etc....

    I have never been in this situation, but I think SR should put a small message on that form that reads "hint: seller rating is optional, rating can also be done later" or something like it. Or a small "skip" button instead of "cancel", personally I interpret "cancel" like it would cancel the whole finalization. Rating doesn't look like an optional step for me currently.

    I had thought the same about the cancel button until I noticed the bit on the page before about how clicking the finalize button is final and cannot be undone so on an order that was nothing of any consequence I hit the cancel button wondering if it cancelled the option to leave feedback but it doesn't. Just feels wrong doing it so I just click my account link or usually messages and send a small thank you note to the vendor for their time and to notify them that it has been done and whenever I want to return and provide the feedback it's still sitting there in orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One thing to note though is that it doesn't show as an order in the little tally next to the link to the orders section of your account once this has been done. (the first step) so I have found it can also be used to release funds to a vendor once the order has arrived and the leave feedback after actually sampling the product over a meaningful period of time. Sometimes I can't just tear open the pack and hook in and some products need to run a full course to be able to asses their quality and my experiences with it... others its just not a good idea communicate in any way shape or form with anyone or anything while they are influencing the levels of enthusiasm and retardness you may display if this is attempted.... The crystal cannon can be a prime example of this.... pipe hanging out of the corner of the mouth (dribbling down the stem...) wide eyed frantically tapping out a tapestry of intricate and complex grammatical wizardry with a vocabulary as diverse as the the words used are obscure is something I have often felt is the case with some people.. hell I may have even ... no I absolutely have caught myself in this situation!! .

    I agree with the OP...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think leaving feedback saying exactly where you are and how long it takes to get to you is only helping LEO...
    <br/>
    If the order was delivered from another country simply say "international" rather than the specific country.
    <br/>
    This lets others know that the vendor has been successful in getting the order to a different country and safely into your hands..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And HellinaHandBasket if you think that there is no chance of a CD or at least seizure being the result of some stupid cunt naming his country when finalizing early then you have not thought the situation through very well at all..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The less specifics LEO know about vendors / orders the better, with many vendors now asking customers to not state country in feedback at all..
    <br/>

    I don't think that this is as big of a deal as you all make it out to be. If I FE on a shippment from Sweden, and post that I am in USA.

    Running dogs through sorting centers will be happening randomly on both borders at one time or another.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And thinking LEO of some form or another are not watching for the stupid cunts dropping info like this is being too complacent IMO. People have to remember that they are buying ( usually trafficking amounts ) of illegal drugs here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By stating that you are in the US and have just finalized early for lets say a 1/2oz of MDMA.
    <br/>
    You have just told whoever is watching, maybe Sweden LEO, that in a day or two there is going to be a 1/2oz package of MDMA going through the mail from Sweden going to USA. And pretty much asking them to look at the mail between these two countries a bit harder. Maybe even tempt them to x-ray some mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This may not be a big deal if yours is the only order the vendor is sending to the US at that time. But if the vendor is popular they can have dozens of orders in that same days mail all going to the USA. They only have to find one of them orders to profile any others in that days and future mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All this may not be such a concern when talking about the big countries such as the US and UK ect.
    <br/>
    But for smaller or more isolated countries this could cause some serious shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just do not understand why people insist on publicly revealing anymore info on vendorsÂ  / orders / locations / times ect than is necessary. All your doing increasing the chance of detection by giving a big piece of the puzzle for free.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some will say I am just being paranoid and thats fine with me.. Better to be safe than sorry..

    So people that name their country of residence are stupid cunts... That's nice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just updated my feedback for a vendor where I stated delivery time and my country or residence. Just so people can get a better idea of the success rate and shipping time (I know shipping time varies a lot). To think that that would do any difference is a little too paranoid imo. Why would that matter at all? Its all anonymous so its only saying that a package with drugs made it through customs. Im pretty sure customs already know that a lot of stuff gets through, not really new information there. But it is very helpful for buyers tho, at least I find it very helpful.

    Then vendors would get pissed because lots of people would think it's optional / unnecessary and not leave feedback, or they would intend to submit a rating after the product arrives but forget later. Think of all the people who say they will update and never do. The end result is that vendors would be deprived of stats that boost their position on the site. More specifically, vendors who try to protect themselves with FE (which is allowed once you get 35 transactions and $1500 in sales) would be punished. So they would be forced to make a choice between exposing themselves to scammer buyers and losing sales because of reduced ranking, because of fewer ratings.

      And thinking LEO of some form or another are not watching for the stupid cunts dropping info like this is being too complacent IMO. People have to remember that they are buying ( usually trafficking amounts ) of illegal drugs here.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      By stating that you are in the US and have just finalized early for lets say a 1/2oz of MDMA.
      <br/>
      You have just told whoever is watching, maybe Sweden LEO, that in a day or two there is going to be a 1/2oz package of MDMA going through the mail from Sweden going to USA. And pretty much asking them to look at the mail between these two countries a bit harder. Maybe even tempt them to x-ray some mail.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This may not be a big deal if yours is the only order the vendor is sending to the US at that time. But if the vendor is popular they can have dozens of orders in that same days mail all going to the USA. They only have to find one of them orders to profile any others in that days and future mail.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      All this may not be such a concern when talking about the big countries such as the US and UK ect.
      <br/>
      But for smaller or more isolated countries this could cause some serious shit.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I just do not understand why people insist on publicly revealing anymore info on vendorsÂ  / orders / locations / times ect than is necessary. All your doing increasing the chance of detection by giving a big piece of the puzzle for free.
      <br/>

      Some will say I am just being paranoid and thats fine with me.. Better to be safe than sorry..

     So people that name their country of residence are stupid cunts... That's nice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I just updated my feedback for a vendor where I stated delivery time and my country or residence. Just so people can get a better idea of the success rate and shipping time (I know shipping time varies a lot). To think that that would do any difference is a little too paranoid imo. Why would that matter at all? Its all anonymous so its only saying that a package with drugs made it through customs. Im pretty sure customs already know that a lot of stuff gets through, not really new information there. But it is very helpful for buyers tho, at least I find it very helpful.

    Yes you are correct.. I think that people who leave their country in the feedback when they FE are stupid cunts..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It matters because you dont have your drugs yet..Â  You are finalizing early so your drugs have not gone through the mail system yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By leaving your country in the feedback when you FE you are not helping out other customers because you have not even got your shit yet and do not know for sure that it will get through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A lot of vendors dont like having countries named in their feedback either..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People will do as they please anyway of course.. This is just my opinion..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Different strokes for different folks I guess.

    Agreed with OP. Less detail the best. Compliments are nice but anything detailing location should be deleted. Customers should receive warning for doing so. Really should not have written feedback. Star rating is enough.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      for all those who write 'FE - blah blah' can I ask a favour? when you FE for a vendor don't enter a score or leave the written feedback. Just leave it blank and close the tab or navigate away and it will sit in your orders section on your account ready to be filled in when there all is said and done. This way we can all get to the feedback that is an actual report of the outcome rather than pages of FE... FE.... FE!!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Besides we don't know who you are so telling us your taking a gamble/doing the right thing/whatever the reason is... Well, Its fairly pointless at best but TBH the reality is its actually really annoying. I don't go "Oh what a champ for doing that" or "Wow that guy is looking after the vendor. What a champ" when I'm going through page after page of them.... its more like "Oh FFS... I don't care you wouldn't normally do this and/or you really hope it arrives... I mean well DUH... II don't believe you will actually come back and update too BTW.. why lie like that? I've done nothing against you..." ;-p
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Also can you really finalize early on a lottery like this? really the transaction is complete once the number is sent to you as its that number you are buying.. so really it was just 'F(inalized) Lottery ' or something like this. Just saying is all"
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Don't leave any comment when FE is required! Not even a blank or 'leave feedback here' one. Just click the finalise button and navigate away from the page that has the score and text box. When the order arrives (or not) go back into orders and it will still be there waiting for your pearls of wisdom and high level of long term drug knowledge to be passed along to all the anonymous people buying their drugs on the anonymous market.... on the hidden service.....
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But I disagree with the OP. Tell us your Country AFTER it has arrived so we know who is good where and it also gives a more transparent way to determine success rate beyond the stock vendor statementÂ  'we have a high success rate' heh ever asked a dealer what their gear is like? 99% of the time that are going to tell you its good.. 'Oh man nah don't but it from me I have shit gear' has never passed the lips of any dealer I know.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As for the idea that there is a chance of a CD when a FE message includes the country... well actually I don't know where to start with why that is wrong... so wrong... Well I guess I can sum up my view point by saying its an anonymous comment on an anonymous market that is a hidden service on the dark net protected by tor... The LEO that can look at a FE statement and know that its you posting, manages to intercept the exact package then CD you without having already had a fair amount of Intel on you as an individual... well they should be working for the code breakers of the CIA etc....

     I agree with the OP...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I think leaving feedback saying exactly where you are and how long it takes to get to you is only helping LEO...
     <br/>
     If the order was delivered from another country simply say "international" rather than the specific country.
     <br/>
     This lets others know that the vendor has been successful in getting the order to a different country and safely into your hands..
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And HellinaHandBasket if you think that there is no chance of a CD or at least seizure being the result of some stupid cunt naming his country when finalizing early then you have not thought the situation through very well at all..
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The less specifics LEO know about vendors / orders the better, with many vendors now asking customers to not state country in feedback at all..

    I see what your saying and in part and on reflection I agree with the spirit of keeping them in the dark as much as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However I think people who feel the need to leave ANY comment when FEing is a poser and feels like somehow writing that they have done it will help their gear arrive to em.. silly I can imagine some derp FEing on 500 pils and leaving the country its going into.. now that may give them the opportunity to be on 'high alert' when sorting the incoming main from whatever counrty it was ordered from. After its arrived though, except on those large orders perhaps, people should leave the country it made it intoÂ  to keep vendor more accountable and to indicate who is the better option to go with if your in that country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Solution? IF you insist of FEing (or the vendor has insisted and you feel its appropriate) don't leave ANY FUCKING COMMENT!! that way the y are completely in the dark as to the the number of orders out there in the system for them to find..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is something to be said for not thumbing your nose after the fact but its a reality that won't change anytime soon that as much as there are scamming customers there are also cunning and unscrupulous vendors out there. Sucks and most are good but like we good buyers get painted with the same brush as the dodgy ones till we have proven ourselves the vendors are in the same position. By design the person/people who can and do run big ops are opportunistic, dynamic and pragmatic people so will, wherever possible, capitalize on opportunities to get money for nothing and drugs for free. Again not all but on SR you have to expect people to not just take your word for, well, almost anything IMO.

      Personally I would never include my country in the feedback because I do not want to draw any additional attention to my vendors of choice and to be quite honest the only people who seem incapable of not leaving this piece of information out of their feedback is Australians, makes me cringe every time I see it.

    It's been discussed many times in the previous aussie threads, history repeating itself. If someone cannot see why doing that is a bad idea in the first place it makes me wonder what other risks they are taking with their SR activity.

    Why help the enemy, some people have a seriously bad habit of over disclosing information it seems.

    I took an opposite approach. The number of reviews I'd read on a SR vendor profile (which can't be traced to an individual user/ username) saying "Fast delivery, delivered internationally in 5 days" or "No problems shipping to my country" are no help whatsoever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a prospective customer, any information about how long a package is going to take to reach me is very helpful. It prevents me from being a Window - Pervert (looking out for the postman all the time) and allows me to assess whether the vendors packaging methods are sufficient for my countries Customs and Border Agency. I don't want to be taking a risk during the order process with the uncertainty things will be delivered, and in decent time. So stating your country should be acceptable, as long as you've received the order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People FE and state their country - why would they do this? That doesn't really help anyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If people disclose too much information, that's their own problem and I have no care in the world for people who don't act responsibly. But as stated earlier, with Law Enforcement primarily concerned in the sellers - the dealers, more than the small time consumers, as well as it already being difficult to trace a single transaction with a name and address or even a username, I really don't think this is that much of an issue to be concerned about.
