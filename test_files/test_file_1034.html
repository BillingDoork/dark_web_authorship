    I'm sure this has been asked before and I did use the search bar for about 30 minutes but didn't find exactly what I was looking for. I have made several successful transactions and I don't know, I guess I've just been paranoid lately so I want to make sure I'm doing things very correct.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are tips or safe ways to receive a package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I usually just write in red marker return to sender on it and sit on it for about 5 days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this even a good idea?

    dude you can open your package.. Unless the package has over a kilo and you saw some DEA agents delivering the pack to you, then you have nothing to worry about..  If you are in the US or Canada the fact that you are holding your pack is proof enough that they didn't catch it, Go ahead open it and enjoy it!

    5 days???   Omg I'm lucky if I can get back inside before that envelope is opened.    Seriously......make sure you order from vendors that know how to ship and you should be ok.

    5 days is a lot.. It's recommended you wait no more than 1 day. Unless you're ordering some really serious amounts (which you shouldn't get delivered to your home address), the cops aren't gonna wait long before raiding. If you really want to be super secure about stuff I'd recommend reading everything on this site : http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/polyfront.html (not clearnet)
    <br/>
    It tells you all about drug smuggling, drugs in the mail, PGP, TOR, etc.

    +1  to 'tree' if i have karma access.  like someone mentioned if its gonna go down, minutes after.  they likely getcha from the mailbox back to the front door.  at that time, the jig is likely already up as theyd already been planning.   read up on your vendors, you leave alot of trust in their hands.

    I usually tear mine open immediately like an animal. Seriously though, if its domestic its alot safer. I wouldnt woryy so much. International a little less so, I always get international shit to a different address and name then transport elsewhere before opening. If they intercept it you'll likely get a letter from customs or the filth kicking your door in if its serious. A little paranoia is good anyway - keeps you on your toes.

    +1 for the link, here's an excerpt of what I found to be most important:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Securing Drop Points
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Securing drop points involves creating a perimeter around them in an attempt to detect manned surveillance. There are two scenarios; pick up teams and solo pick ups. Both have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of team pick ups include ability to do real time perimeter monitoring during the pick up. Disadvantages include having a team know about you and the pick up in the first place. Only very trusted people should be part of pick up teams with each other. Advantages of solo pick ups are lack of required trust in a team. Disadvantages are inability to do real time perimeter monitoring.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pick up surveillance teams can communicate with encrypted walkie talkies. The individual doing the actual physical pick up may prefer an ear piece.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Google Earth or really any map can be used to determine the optimal positioning of a surveillance team. If a drop is in the middle of various intersections, having eyes on the street can give an early alert to the pick up agent if unfriendly vehicles approach. Guaranteed reaction times (time to flee after a malicious entity is detected approaching) can be  more or less assured if all possible routes of entry are guarded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if a pick up team is not possible or desired, counter-surveillance around drop area is suggested. Look for people who seem to be doing surveillance. It is best to make a pick up when there is no other person around for quite some area. "

    In general I don't think you have to worry when buying small amounts. It's always a possibility of course that they come to your door, but that's highly exceptional in my experience.

    If you're a vendor amounts that info sure is important, the parts about getting PO boxes and how to securely get packages from them is also really important in that case, how to block a GPS transmitter that may be in the package and exactly how to securely get the stuff in the end.

     In general I don't think you have to worry when buying small amounts. It's always a possibility of course that they come to your door, but that's highly exceptional in my experience.

    Sure, I don't think you need a team to secure drop points when you're buying 2grams of weed :P That may just get you into more trouble than getting it shipped to your home address by attracting way more attention.

     5 days is a lot.. It's recommended you wait no more than 1 day. Unless you're ordering some really serious amounts (which you shouldn't get delivered to your home address), the cops aren't gonna wait long before raiding. If you really want to be super secure about stuff I'd recommend reading everything on this site : http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/polyfront.html (not clearnet)

     It tells you all about drug smuggling, drugs in the mail, PGP, TOR, etc.

    Over 80 transactions in about 14 months, and all were delivered to my mailbox. Twice it was through TNT express, a Fedex type deal. Those wanted my signature. I signed. It would've looked pretty odd, if I got all flustered and said "Sign? I'm not signing anything!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Signing really doesn't incriminate you. Haven't you gotten stuff delivered before Silk Road that you just signed for, having no idea what it was?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean, some of you may be inexperienced kids, but believe me, people sign for shit all the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You think that's going to be the one piece of evidence that makes them say Gotcha! ?? - Not a chance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just chill out. Don't be so paranoid. - Be Careful ! By all means. Just not overly paranoid. You'll make more stupid mistakes out of paranoia, that could get you into trouble, than you would blindly signing for "whatever it is someone sent me" - See? - Have that attitude. - Be a bit of an actor. "I wonder what this could be?" - if the mailman says "why don't you open it and find out" - decline. Say "I guess I'll have to do that" See ya!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good Luck!

    Totally agree that NOT signing is a red flag.  Packages get delivered regularly that the recipients don't know whats in them.  Blend in, and you'll be safe.  Go outside the "blend" and you look guilty.

    Not to mention that every law enforcement agency knows that this is what Silk Road users do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would like to add that I don't think anyone has ever received a package and wrote "return to sender" on it in a red marker and held onto it then went to the post office and returned it because they weren't expecting a package.  That is just saying "I'm a member of Silk Road and I know I just received the drugs I ordered."  Almost everyone in the world happily opens unknown packages addressed to them.  Shit, it's like another day of Hanukkah! :D

    I agree that signing for packages basically admits guilt but would you rather be guilty in the eyes of an undercover cop or guilty in the eyes of a judge/ jury? At the end of the day if a CD were to happen I think its safe to say not signing and appearing guilty is better than being found guilty.
