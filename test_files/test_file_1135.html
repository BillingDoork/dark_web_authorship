    Alright so I may be making my first bulk order (or maybe not, who knows?) and I'm curious on finding info on receiving bulk orders. I've been searching the shipping and security forums, but haven't seen any specific topic on receiving bulk orders. I've come across a few ideas, 'drop-off's', friend's houses, abandoned houses (no) and such but none of these appeal to me. Is there a time proven safe and effective method to get your bulk orders in? Would it make sense to ask the vendor to break the order into a multiple shipments? What's the best way to go about this?

    You can always ask the vendor if he/she would split the order into multiple smaller orders for a fee (for the extra cost in shipping and the trouble).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't have a friend who would voluntarily allow it to be shipped to his/her house, then have it delivered to your name and address; not a good idea to send to an unaware neighbor, abandoned house or fake name etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are shipping a bulk order domestic, there really shouldn't be anymore concern than a small order. If it's an international bulk order, then relocate all drugs and drug parphenellia to another location (friend's house) as well as the computer you used to order (unless you're running tails or encryption software [truecrypt], but still may be good to have absolutely nothing at your residence where the order is being delievered to). Keep a totally clean house until the package arrives and to be safe for several days after you get it too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So long as you have not had international packages go missing in the past en route to your address, you should be good!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Order from a vendor with reputable stealth and high delivery success.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    best of luck to you!

    Do not order to your house, that is the worse thing you can do, especially with your real name.

    I agree that using a friend's house is a bad idea because once the cops show up 99% chance they'll start singing to them instead of keeping their mouths shut.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using empty houses doesn't really work with the post because if somebody isn't already picking up the mail then it'll be stopped.  You could use a third-party express carrier but plan on more of your packs getting caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I personally don't have any good options so I'll just have to pay a premium for domestic.  It sure beats jail.

    I'm not the person that said that, but I'd imagine it sucks to have a SWAT team invade your house with a search warrant.  I suppose if the house is 100% clean then its an option but after that they'll certainly be on to you and hell they might decide to arrest you anyway and let the court system figure things out.
