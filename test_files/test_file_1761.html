    I am always nervous when waiting for a delivery no matter where it goes.  I have used several addresses and hate using them all. never had a problem with 52 sr transactions but it didn't get easier.

    Where do you get yours?

    I don't mind telling you I fall into ********** (redacted after i thought. "Why? What difference would it make")category but you are asking why not? As you rightly point out people are nervous, so WHY would they risk any thing that might slightly incease risk. Admittedly its hard to envision a scenario, where the police, having cracked your SR identity are like "right, now if only we could decide whether its his home or his work he's getting it sent to.....oh look, the fool, he's played right into our hands"
    <br/>
    Myself, I'm only nervous whether the postman will bring the damn thing, or surprise me as he likes occaisionally to do by bringing it the day after. I hate rooting through junk mail trying to convince myself 'it must be here somewhere'
    <br/>
    I've grown fairly blase about receiving drugs through the mail. Mind you I only order personal amounts domestically
