    I just came into contact with a lot of 3m 10'' x 6'' moisture proof bags from 3m (best brand).  So let me know if any of you are interested as im willing to cut deals on larger quantities.  These are the best bags you can use for shipping and even dogs can't smell through them.  Other vendors are charging damn near a $1 a bag for bags 1/4 the size.  So let me know if you guys are interested.

    No these are completely legal to sell so i figured most vendors would have a legitimate friend to send some bags to in hopes of retrieving them at a later time.  I didnt start an illegal gambling operation on the road to pop vendors trying to get bags.  Even from an LE standpoint I wouldnt try to get people through bags I would offer unbelievable cashout services to entice people who need to cash out large sums of money.

    Ill go see what it will cost as soon as they arrive.  Im not a vendor who upcharges shipping whatever the post office charges is what i charge.  And there shouldnt be any problems with customs since nothing illegal is being sent ill PM you as soon as im ready.

    I'm pretty sure most vendors have a separate account for buying, and would likely use that one to buy these just like they would buy any other product on The Road.

    I was wrong each bag is 10'' x 12'' these fuckers are huge.  These big guys can be cut into
    <br/>
    <br/>
    12  -  3.33" x  3'' bags   (currently about $.37 each on SR)  Total $4.44 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    9 -  3.33'' x 4''  bags (Currently about $.44 each)   Total $3.96 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    8 -  3'' x  5''       bags (Currently about $.47 each)   Total $3.76 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    6-   5''  x  4''    bags (currently about $.60 each)    Total   $3.60 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4-  5''  x   6''  bags (Currently about $.77 each)      Total $3.08 per 1 of my $2 bags
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2-  5''  x   12''  bags (Not available on SR)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1-  10"  x  12"  bag (Not Available on SR)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These are perfect for diverse sellers who sell many different products as you can make bags of all different sizes for all of your products.  Im only charging $2 per bag which will end up saving you a lot on bags.  Plus you will only need to receive one package versus 2 or 3 if you wanted to buy a couple different sizes of bags.  I will consider price cuts on bulk orders  PM me for details.

    Buying vending supplies on SR is super risky. It IDs your buyer account as a likely vendor alternate.

    Trying to get vendors to hurry and buy these seems sketchy to me. Also, 10" by 12" does not seem

    I completely understand where your coming from but i assure you i did not start the best SR Casino and start taking sports bets by bringing my bookie business to SR just so i can pop possible vendors buying legal products.  I have a great track record on here with plenty of people that can vouch for me.  Im even about to add LSD and AAA+ MMJ (La Blanca)  real soon.  I just found a case of these for a decent price so i figured id try and help people out.
    <br/>
    they can always have these sent to a friend since it is not illegal (Thats what i do) .   Then any address info i get isnt even theirs and if I was some sort of informant I dont think i will be able to secure federal funds to run around the country investigating mylar bags being shipped.

    I'd bet LasVegasLottos means well. There are safe ways for vendors to receive mail from SR. Having something sent to a friend is not usually one of them. If questioned by LE, you would normally want your friend to cooperate rather than risk getting themselves in trouble. That the bags are legal does not really matter to an SR vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since you are acting like it proves your legit, I should mention I don't think much of most SR gambling opportunities either. Offering gambling to inexperienced gamblers is often a scam and even if you are legit and offer fair odds (I have not checked) your service can be like a bad drug for many people. I would not want to take anyones freedom to offer or buy gambling, it just does not impress me as proving you are legit and trustworthy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't really want to mess with your business opportunities, I just don't want inexperienced vendors making mistakes that could cost them their freedom.

    Hey lasvegas, Could I place a bet with you on silkroad for instance regarding an accumulator or a simple X team to win in a football match or something?
    <br/>
    Just say there was a football match on, a simple X team to win bet, could I place it on SR with btc, and be paid in the same way?
    <br/>
    And whats the link to your slots for the free spin? :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers

    The last letter can be any of the 16 randomly generated characters used in the transaction id number.
    <br/>

    The options are    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   a   b  c  d  e   f

     These are perfect for diverse sellers who sell many different products as you can make bags of all different sizes for all of your products.  Im only charging $2 per bag which will end up saving you a lot on bags.  Plus you will only need to receive one package versus 2 or 3 if you wanted to buy a couple different sizes of bags.  I will consider price cuts on bulk orders  PM me for details.

    I've been selling these for 2+ years along side various legals/illegals , now per square cm you appear to be cheaper but your description is a bit sketchy so I'm not sure we are comparing like with like . I'm not looking to start a row , competition is good , its what will help S/R survive :-)

    Im always down for a little friendly competition mate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yours bags are 27in x  15in  =  305 inches squared  at $10 per bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mine are 10in x 12in  =   120 sq inches at $2 per bag
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If one was to purchase 3 of my bags at $2 they would have 360 square inches of mylar bagging material which is more than one of your $10 bags and they would only be paying $6 for mine.  So its 55 square inches of material more for $4 less which price per square inch makes them the cheapest mylar bags on SR.   Hell mine are even cheaper than websites listed in the forums that you can source them from.  Plus these are name brand 3m bags not from any generic sources.  Also i give price cuts on larger ammounts so they will only get cheaper.
