    :'(Just wanted to let everyone know Usps First class mail has been running really slow lately prob due to budgetary cuts and closing the processing plants. I ordered Wenesday within the US and still haven't recived my package even though it shipped Thursday. A friend of mine said he has been hearing a lot of people around him who are complaining about how slow snail mail has become in recent times.

    Last week everything seemed to slow down because of the Labor Day holiday. I am sure that, combined with what you said about sorting facilities closing and staff cuts equals slower delivery for all USPS mail.

    I have a PRIORITY package that was picked up last Tuesday and still hasn't arrived to the destination. Another priority package took 5 days from arriving at one hub until departing from the next hub 90 minutes away. Unbelievable.

    I have had 4 packs received this past week and half after labor day and both were 2 days coast to coast..also shipped something priority and also took 2 days to get there... maybe since I live near like 3 major cities but domestic post has been consistent for me, International is a whole another story!!

    I have received probably received around 80+  priority packages in the past year and a half and all have been here 2 days with the exception of one that was 3 days.  First Class has always ran the same depending on the location it was sent from.  First Class has only been a problem during holiday season for me.

    From experience shipping other items (not SR), really all it depends on is the sorting facilities it goes through. So, if your local one is really slow, then shipping and receiving will be slow for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But it's never going to be the case across the board unless we're talking Christmas (even then). or a few days max after a postal holiday.

    Can't stress this enough. Used to be a top-rated Powerseller on a clearnet auction site, and the farther away you or your shipper (or both of you) are from a major shipping hub, the longer it'll take to receive.  So if you're in a rural area, and so is your seller, you can expect it to take longer than someone shipping from Los Angeles to Miami, for example.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I just got my first shipment in from a seller on SR - two days to the west coast, across 2 states/1 time zone. So on par with average times for mail delivery.

    In the past week I've purchased a ton of shit on eBay. All of them shipped via Priority or First Class mail and they usually doesn't differ much in the times between delivery (occasionally priority makes it a day earlier). Most of those items have been received despite being coast to coast deliveries. Now, I've made my first order on SR which I believe was marked shipped on Tuesday. I've received my eBay items from the other coast that had been shipped on the very same day so I'm not encountering any slower shipping times than usually. Unfortunately, I am still patiently waiting on the SR item! Hope it gets here very soon, I can't wait to sample it, and I really didn't want it to sit at a PO over the weekend.
