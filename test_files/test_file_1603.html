    Just under 8 months ago I shipped several packages out using USPS Global Express. It was the first and will be the last time using this service. For those who are not familiar with it its a combination of USPS and FedEx. Basically from my understanding USPS delivers it as far as to the receiving country and then FedEx delivers it to the final destination. I tracked the packages on a regular basis and everything appeared normal until all of the sudden one went from "out for delivery" to being returned to sender. Using a burn phone and disguised voice I called to check on the package. The operator said that the packages are being returned to the US to clear customs before going back out. I continued to check them from time to time but the status never changed and neither me or the buyer heard anything else about it. I had never heard of such a thing and honestly it seemed very strange to me. Has anyone ever ran into or even heard of this happening before? One would think that if a package is caught by customs they would one go after the buyer and two not make it obvious that something is wrong. Has enough time passed that I should be safe or is there still reason for concern?
