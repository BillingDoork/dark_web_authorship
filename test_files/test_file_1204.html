    Has this ever happened to anyone?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What would happen and what should you do if LE intercepts a package containing some drug that isn't illegal (and assuming it doesn't fall under the Analogue Act). Claim ownership and tell them to fuck off?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ask because there's a chance my mail has been screened, so if I'm ordering a legal drug they might still take it...

    No.. why would they take it..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you can obtain it legally then theres no reason for them to stop it.

    They will seize any unmarked pills or powders because they look "illegal", but I have no idea how you would fight it. Back when I was into research chems I heard of people losing MXE ordered from overseas to customs. Granted, it was like $30 worth of MXE so it wouldn't have been worth fighting for, not sure what you would do for a large amount. Either way, fighting LE over any amount of "probably legal" drugs is probably a good way to get put on some watch list.

    Lol, I got one of my packages a few days ago, nothing happened. Won't say what came, but let's leave it at they're in blotter form and unscheduled but look like they could be LSD to LE. I'm betting the vast majority of interceptions occur due to drug dogs, so if it's a drug that the dogs aren't trained to smell they almost always go through.

    Which is why most CDs are for cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, MDMA, and marijuana.
