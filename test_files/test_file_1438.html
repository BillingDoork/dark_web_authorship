    Has anyone here ever actually had a CD before? Are they even likely at all if a vendor uses even a modicum of stealth? Now, when I say CD I don't mean a mail man asking you to sign, USPS fucks up all the time... what I mean is obvious suspicious behavior regarding receiving your packages and what not, or following house-warrant raids, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everyone here talks about them but everyone I have talked to does not seem worried about them, even for bulk international orders. What is your take on them?

    I've always wanted to know what's the chance of a CD for small (personal use) amounts. That question has never been answered.
    <br/>
    Bulk amounts surely will bring a CD if the contents are discovered. There have been enough news reports over the years about doors being kicked in to recover a bulk package of contraband. A few years ago, in the US, the mayor of a small town called Berwyn Heights had his door kicked in and his dog was shot. He'd picked up a large package of weed from his doorstep and the cops were waiting. Last I heard people were sure it was a mistake.

    odd that they waited until the next day, suggests that they were gonna raid you anyway and it was nothing to do with your delivery

    My post doesn't apply if you live outside of the EU, cause I know jack shit about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it depends a lot on where you live and how much you order and from where you order. A small order domestic is *never* going to have a CD in most parts of Europe. They don't even check letters 99% of the time (in fact, in my country they aren't allowed to due to something called 'secrecy of correspondence', they can't x-ray letters), only packages. LE can't be bothered checking letters for a gram of something, it's simply not worth the effort for them. They go after suppliers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pretty sure as soon as it starts crossing countries (except EU, because EU there is no checking either) you are going to run into customs and chances are higher. Even then, letters will probably never result in a CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think CDs will only happen on big international orders. If you order 200 or 500 pills from The Netherlands to the USA, then ye, you have a chance of getting a CD as the DEA flags you as a dealer.

    Your input is as random and unverified as mine. I even doubt that, since I can guarantee you I've done more reading about it, since I'm a little paranoid/obsessed about these sort of things.

    Like I said, it depends on where you live. I'll edit into my post that my opinion is contained to where I live then. We don't all live in the United States of War on Drugs.

    There is one glaring example of CD out there that no one seems to mention in these threads. The MLB pitcher Chris Perez got a CD of cannabis that he had sent to his house with his dog's name on the packages. His wife signed for them and they searched his house. It definitely happens. I would have to find the article, but I am pretty sure he ordered off SR.

    Anyway, there's nothing to suggest it wasn't anything but a friend of his mailing him a pretty decent (1/3rd of a lb) amount of weed.  I highly doubt it was SR as there's no mention of stealth, really.  The guy is an idiot:
    <br/>
    "According to the WEB report of the search, Perez and his wife were "asked if the home contained any form of contraband, weapons or cash. Chris Perez responded that he had 'personal use' marijuana in the basement and volunteered to direct the officers to the location of it."

    I've talked to a friend in prison on an ipad before.  You pay the right guard and you can get some things.  Phones are very common.  Mp4 players with music and porn are around.  Ipads are very rare but not unheard of.  A couple dumbasses got busted for posting photos on their facebook and twitter from inside prison. ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I believe that you have internet access in prison in Norway.  Not 100% positive on that and I don't have the time to look it up.

    Not nessisarily true..... I knew someone who got busted with a LOT of drugs that they got off SR and was looking at 15-20 years in prison... they were out of prison on bail for an entire year before the trial. If anyone gets a CD here and they have even a little money or family support, they will be out on bond for quite some time until the trial happens.

    I'll answer for everyone, "No"  everyone knows someone who did, but in reality, your right theres so much talk about it, has not happened yet ill gaurantee it.  And if it did happen to someone, they wouldnt get life in prison, so they could easily explain the scenario, the answer is no, everyone here gets nervous which i understand, but then a 20 page thread on cd's will happen, everyone explains when they happen, why they happen, hasnt happen yet

     CDs happen all the time.  I recall a few people talking about their CDs on SR only to be asked for more detail and also told they are stupid for even being on SR after a CD and sharing any details.  There's always somebody to call them a liar as well.

    Everyone knows people its happened to apparently, my answer is still no, it hasnt ever happened  In my original response I said everyone knows people its happen to,  somehow, except me, and theres not many people who have been a member as long as I have.  So the next response will be someone saying it happened to them.  The answer is no, but who knows what everyones gonna write.  "They happen all the time",  "1 outta 3"  "each person who places an order gets a CD"  (thats going by domestic orders, international Im not as sure as I don't have much experience)

    ok. it's been more than a yer. i guess it's time for me to share.
    <br/>
    i barely got away with charges. i was locked and interrogated for 48 hours. then released.
    <br/>
    i was stupid enough to accept a mail when they attempted CD.
    <br/>
    after i was brought down to the station, i felt that they need my full confession to prosecute by the way they talk to me.

    so what did i do? kept my mouth shut for full denial.

      My best friend is in prison currently serving an 8 year sentence for organized crime, possession of a weapon furthering a drug trafficking crime(or whatever it's called) and conspiracy. He is in max security right now but when his points get lower he'll move to minimum and be able to email. I have another friend in minimum right now that talks to me on facebook everyday because he snuck his fucking phone in. LOL. I've never been in prison but I did once sneak a phone into jail via GOOCH!

     Everyone knows people its happened to apparently, my answer is still no, it hasnt ever happened  In my original response I said everyone knows people its happen to,  somehow, except me, and theres not many people who have been a member as long as I have.  So the next response will be someone saying it happened to them.  The answer is no, but who knows what everyones gonna write.  "They happen all the time",  "1 outta 3"  "each person who places an order gets a CD"  (thats going by domestic orders, international Im not as sure as I don't have much experience)

    law enforcement simply isn't our line of business. the postal inspectors only get involved when another LE agency wants them to, or if something suspicious is literally leaking out of the box.
