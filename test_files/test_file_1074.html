    So I finally got some pills, not many but it eventually got here, tad late.
    <br/>
    But it had been opened by customs all the way to were the pills were but yet they left the opened for inspection however nothing was found and it was still shipped to me :s
    <br/>
    Does this mean my address has been flagged ? as to the point they let it through so that I would still deliver to the address, like it seems pretty sus, considering the pills were in plain sight.

    It sounds okay but I honestly have no experience with a scenario such as this so can't help much more than advising you to stash the pills off your property as soon as possible, just in case. It's likely nothing, but I'll move the thread to the Shipping forum so it gets more exposure, and you'll have a better chance of getting some good advice there.

    Was it AQIS or Customs that opened it? I have had a package opened by AQIS and sent on sealed back up with Orange tape and they didn't find my M either? I think they only look for organic food type stuff as opposed to customs that check for illicits. I am sure if it was only a small amount like less than 10 they wouldn't send it on but would just confiscate it.

    I want to chime in here because this sounds very familiar to me. I shipped multiple 15 gram packs of MDMA to a single Australian address (not on the same day) and one also got opened. It looked like they used a ordinary envelope opener and then sealed it again with a big stroke of see trough tape. All subsequent packs arrived though but if you have the option to change addresses for future shipments I would definitely do that :)

    There is not a chance in hell that Custom's would allow illegal drugs to reach the recipient if the package was inspected IMO. Imagine if one of those pills ended up being responsible for a user becoming extremely sick or even dying and Customs allowed that to happen!! Yes, they may now be watching/monitoring your address for future packages and gathering intelligence on your activities but for 10 pills, they would have just seized them.

    Yeah chances are they didn't know what it was for some reason and just sent it on. Customs are weird here, but pretty sure at least that they never do controlled drops like in other countries, if they know what they are they should just confiscate them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is a chance they will be watching closer on future packages though, find sellers that specifically have good stealth methods to ship when buying from OS.

    You'll be fine, just hold off ordering to that address for a while.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    10 pills won't have Peter Skyora bashing down your door at 7am, if he were going to they would have not sent through the gear.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Speaking from experience having known people who have had this stuff happen to them. They will probably log the pills and your name in the system and if you keep on getting mail picked up to that address under your name they'll come for a visit using this instance as the start of the initial time frame for your alleged importation of scheduled substances (this happened to someone) other than that you're fine...hell there's even that very slim chance you had an officer who just doesn't give a fuck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My final piece of advice is to not order pills from OS if you live in Australia as most vendors stealth doesn't hold up to a good shakedown when it comes to them as you now know.

    I would guess that you are fine in this particular situation. If they were going to bust you they would have done so immediately, before you could get rid of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I would be extremely cautious in future as I can't see any plausible reason for them to let the pills through other than to wait and watch and try to catch bigger amounts for a better case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I'd order nothing to that name or address, or any other name listed as living at that address ever again.

    They aren't stupid - they know what those were.

    Customs are not legally allowed to let drugs pass through, if you haven't already been arrested, you are fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your order had a brush with death, and still made it through. While you enjoy it, give a moment of silence to all the orders that weren't so lucky :(

    Believe it or not the exact same thing happened to me, with the same pills, but to a different country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The "stealth" (and I use that word very lightly) had been slashed open and content viewed, but the pack was resealed with gold customs stamp and sent on.

     Ordinarily I wouldn't reply to your posts on here Wodozo because let's face it, we don't like each other, however, you should watch on YouTube the episode of Australian Drug Lords about the Adley brothers, and see just how much they will let through to watch people.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They let them take like 250,000 of them or something in a big sports bag, on a plane, opened the bags and took evidence, and then sent them on their way and let them be sold a Schoolies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The hypocritical fucks!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, this one seems odd I must say, but compared to them that's nothing and furthermore who knows, they may be waiting for him to order larger to nail him with something decent and use that as evidence at a later date!

    JWM, let me clarify a few of your comments so the story is correct. Firstly, I believe you're referring to the Baggaley brothers, Nathan and Dru. I have never heard of the Adley brothers myself. Australian Drug Lords was a great show and I watched every episode religiously. The Richard Buttrose episode left me gobsmacked with the kilo blocks and $1.3 million he had stashed in his secret unit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whilst under surveillance, the Police watched Dru fly to Sydney carrying a sports bag. He caught a taxi to a smash repair shop where after a short stay, left the repair shop with with the sports bag now much bulkier, caught a taxi back to the airport and checked his sports bag luggage in. After Dru had boarded the flight and was on his way, Police had already seized his luggage and suspecting it contained drugs, opened it up. They found thousands of pills with a street value of over $250,000.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When Dru landed back in the Gold Coast, he discovered that his bag was missing and started to panic. Dru or Nathan never got the bag back and just wrote it off, even though they were told the Police must have it and suspected it may have been seized. Even after this incident, they continued to deal large quantities of pills. Each time a buyer made a purchase, the Police would stop them on a traffic stop and confiscate the pills they just purchased.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So the Police never let Dru Baggaley take the sports bag full of pills with him. He thought the bag was seized or stolen as it didn't show up when he arrived in the Gold Coast, but couldn't be certain. The Police seized all those pills and the pills bought by buyers who made subsequent purchases from Dru. It was only after phone intercepts suggested they were about to flood Schoolie's with their pills and the capture on video of Nathan actually conducting a big sale of pills, which Police were waiting months for, that they were finally arrested with 10 search warrants executed and the whole operation brought to a close. I think from memory that Nathan got around 9 years and Dru got 12 years.

    I'm not sure that this is entirely true. It doesn't make perfect sense but I know of a few cases where people have ordered drugs from online pharmacies and had their packages opened. Customs would seize some items (e.g., pain meds) but not others (e.g., benzos) even though both items are scheduled the same and require a prescription to import. I don't know if they aren't checking all the items but it is something to keep in mind.

    It is good to be cautious but I would suspect if they were going to allow the drugs though then put you under surveillance then they wouldn't have taped up the package with customs tape and alerted you to the fact.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seems like a odd scenario any way you look at it, take precautions but I suspect you just got lucky, either that or the Nintendo's you have did not test positive for an illegal substance, or the customs person was into clubbing and decided not to fuck with your stash, all of those scenarios are highly implausible by the way :-)

    This same thing happened to me and I have never been able to figure out what the deal is..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had 5g of a 2Cx shipped to me in Aus from overseas. When it arrived it had been opened and taped closed with orange customs tape. There was a leaflet inside saying it had been opened by customs on a routine inspection but nothing had been removed. The product was all there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the time I cleaned house and wait a fortnight to see if I'd get a knock on the door. I never did, so I relaxed. This was around 12 months ago. Since then I have received multiple orders to the same address from overseas and none appear to have been opened. I have gone over and over this in my head and I feel like there are two possible scenarios playing out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either:
    <br/>
    1. Customs checked my product and finding that it didn't test positive to any common drugs (coke, smack, amphs, MDMA etc) gave me the benefit of the doubt allowing that it could plausibly be a dietary supplement or something and released it to me. Under this scenario they may or may not have logged my address for extra attention of future mail...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or:
    <br/>
    2. On testing, customs were able to identify exactly what the product was and since then they have been recording items coming to my address. I wonder if its possible that customs can open packages and envelopes then reseal them so that they don't look like they've been opened. Under this scenario they will have been recording all the items I've purchased from abroad ever since the first item they opened, keeping records that would eventually be used in a prosecution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can build strong cases in my mind for each of these scenarios. I can also think of a whole bunch of reasons why each of these scenarios may not be happening.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like.. If they intercept something they know to be a prohibited substance. They surely won't release it, they'd get the police involved and a warrant would be issued.. On the flip side.. Maybe if they think there's a possibility the person could be dealing, they decide to take a longer look at the person. They might release the package ao they dont spook the perpetrator, then, getting the cops involved they might start to look at bank accounts etc to see if they can build a stronger case rather than just nab them straight away for importing a prohibited substance..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they can show that someone has been making multiple imports over a period of time, and accumulating unexplained amounts of money etc, then they can build a strong case to put that person away and make any prosecution stick..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another thing I'm not sure about: are customs able to identify synthetics? Or just the common drugs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is a useful discussion.
