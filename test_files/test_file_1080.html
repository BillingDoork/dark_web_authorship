    Just curious if it is common practice to tip one's postman.. I've considered it just because the guy hooks me up even though he may not know it. on the other hand it could make one seem more suspect, he might think he was being payed to look the other way.. what do you guys think?

    I tip the postman who handles my PO box.

    He sends me a text message whenever I get a package.

    I might even get him a cheap cellphone.

    They're allowed to accept gift cards and gifts of a $20 value or less, but they're not supposed to accept cash in any amount.

    One time I left a Valentine's Day card with a sucker for the mailman; he didn't take it. The FedEx man, on the other hand, was grinning ear to ear when he saw the card waiting for him.

    Christmas and Easter I always give a nice card with 50$ in it. She always leaves packages even when they need to be signed for as a favor to me. It is a great thing to have your mailman as a good friend.

    Different countries, and different generations, may have stunted the 'natural tradition' to tip the mail man. Speaking for the US, having grown up in the 60's-70's-80's, you ALWAYS tipped the postman, at the very least on Christmas, if not the usual traditional holidays. Whether you were a firm believer in Chrisitanity or Judiasim, really didn't matter, as it was that time of year when delivering the mail didn't seem like such and easy job.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now with Unions, and mob rule mentality, the average person of the new millennium can't help but think of the Union Postal Worker, as nothing more than one of the soldiers picking up for "the boss".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A once noble profession, which was almost looked upon with admiration, for what they did might be a simpletons work, but because of the socialists that infiltrated the country since WWII, have become nothing more than gang members. They now retire with summer homes in addition to their 1st home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing against multiple home ownership, but when it's gotten simply by being a 'member' in a force too great to reckon with. One starts to look at that tip and say, "No fucking way!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks Unions! - and the commie/socialist hybrids that nurtured the beast called "The Union"

    I feel like only people over 40 do this. I remember my dad tipping every holiday. He gave me the advice give money always to the people who handle your things. Just like you would tip your waiter because you don't want someone to spit in your food. You want your mail to show up every time don't you? All postal service employees will occasionally not deliver an item because they don't want to take the extra time, so they leave your mail for the next day. When your mail man is thinking damn iv been delivering mail for hours I am done, and looks at that box, he will say, "you know what, mr.so and so, is the nicest person I deliver to."

    I feel like an old timer being one of the first members of the road. I get asked a million questions by everyone. It's insane how much this place has grown.

    make order from ebay or amazon ($ 3 stuff) so as not to arouse suspicion and be natural, take it as an opportunity to give a tip to the postman (you'll know what to say smiling)

    in this way you may have the privileges,and avoid the postman ''losing''(  ;) ) mail

    Tip your mailman around Christmas time. Trust me, he's getting tips from other houses even if the official USPS company line is "No tips for our mailmen, we pay them enough thank you."

    Houses with retired couples almost always tip their mailman in my neighborhood. It's the young whippersnappers that forgot.

     Different countries, and different generations, may have stunted the 'natural tradition' to tip the mail man. Speaking for the US, having grown up in the 60's-70's-80's, you ALWAYS tipped the postman, at the very least on Christmas, if not the usual traditional holidays. Whether you were a firm believer in Chrisitanity or Judiasim, really didn't matter, as it was that time of year when delivering the mail didn't seem like such and easy job.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now with Unions, and mob rule mentality, the average person of the new millennium can't help but think of the Union Postal Worker, as nothing more than one of the soldiers picking up for "the boss".
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A once noble profession, which was almost looked upon with admiration, for what they did might be a simpletons work, but because of the socialists that infiltrated the country since WWII, have become nothing more than gang members. They now retire with summer homes in addition to their 1st home.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nothing against multiple home ownership, but when it's gotten simply by being a 'member' in a force too great to reckon with. One starts to look at that tip and say, "No fucking way!"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks Unions! - and the commie/socialist hybrids that nurtured the beast called "The Union"

    Geez! What a grouch I was here! -- Sorry folks. Must've been out of my DOC :-[
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After receiving my "DOC" today, and reading through all these posts, I've changed my mind.
    <br/>
    I'm tipping my mail carrier. They do rotate the routes every few weeks, but it's the same 3 people. I figure 4 $5 gift cards to Dunkin Donuts ought to be allowed? Maybe include a little note, sorry I missed you guys at Christmas, have a cool Iced Tea on me this summer! :D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry for my anti-union rant. I belonged to one for 20 years, and when I got sacked, they didn't lift a finger, (or a phone receiver) to help me. So a little sour grapes there. (sorry) :-\

    @jagfug - at least you manned up an said "sorry" :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My Dad is a retired USPS letter carrier, and he'd agree with some of that rant. They way he explains it, way back when, the mailmen really got paid shitty, and the Gov't was very stingy with raises. So they unionized, and held their feet to the fire.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then like all good things, someone got greedy, and they started making outrageous demands. Then the postal service became semi-privatized, and the letter carries unions power has been decreasing over time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then with the advent of email, the need for letter carriers dwindled. I think he said they're cutting out Saturday delivery in August? Supposedly they'll still deliver Priority and Express packages, so there's something to keep in mind for Vendors and Buyers alike.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just think, if this was August, you'd be waiting till Monday for that "DOC" !
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh yeah, tip your mailman! - He said; "You always remember the tippers".  He'd go that extra step for those customers. He'd also go the extra step for an old lady on Social Security, who couldn't afford to tip as well.  :)
