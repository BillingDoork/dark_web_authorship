    My package arrived but I noticed tape around the openings of the envelope plus a minor tear below the first stamp, spanning its width..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I be worried? What should I do should LE come to my door? What do I say?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My vendor uses industry vacuum packing just as an IE
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    I had a package show up a while back that looked like it had been caught in some machinery, and tore the end open. The vendor had taken care to conceal the contents, so I wasn't worried. I'm sure you will be fine.

    If LE comes to your door, you say that you don't know anything about any package, then don't say anything. Politely decline to answer any questions, and definitely don't volunteer any information. It is way too easy to say something that can come back and haunt you later, and that is where people fuck up.

    "I was only going 3 miles per hour over the speed limit officer", bam. You just admitted to a crime.
    <br/>
    "I only had 2 beers". The officer writes on their report "Admitted to drinking and driving".

    At first I was scared to open the package but with a little bit of courage I did, and inside was also tape, covering the vacuum packed 'contents' with paper, and the same tape. Looks like I got nothing to worry about, got me shitting my pants for a second there, Im not too sure about the slit under the stamp though, might have been accidental, might have not. In any case, by looking inside, all one could see what looks to be paper and no odor. Very stealthy packaging indeed, got me doubting for a minute there.
