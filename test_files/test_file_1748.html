    I've consistently heard that shipping domestically is safer than doing so internationally, but does anyone have any experience or know anyone that has explained what types of security are added for international shipping that don't apply domestically? I know international shipping often implies longer delivery time, which is in itself more risky, but are there any additional security measures involved that are applied to all international shipping orders? For reference, I live in the United States, though I'm sure many other countries have similar systems.

    One advantage to ordering international is that if your vendor gets busted/compromised, chances are they won't try to investigate YOU when you're half-way around the world. This is especially true if there's a language barrier involved.

    You don't have that protection when dealing with domestic, though you do avoid customs.
