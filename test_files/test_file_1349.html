    from the sellers guide "Protect the contents of your package. If your item is brittle (such as pills) it needs to be sent in padded packaging (such as a bubble mailer). Do not send pills or any bulky items in envelopes. Envelopes get flattened in automated sorting machines and their contents get crushed."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what if i put them in a vacuum sealed bag and put a few layers of paper around it. do you think the pills would get crushed?

    This happen sometimes even with the best packages i think, i have also received small pills in a standard envelope that where not crushed at all but i don't recommend you do this (I can clearly see that they were pills inside). Using bubble mailer is the way to go for pills, i suggest you buy some cheap pills from established sellers to see some good packaging methods. Use your imagination otherwise. Good chance !

    When using a bubble mailer is it possible to just put stamps on it and mail it from some random persons mailbox with their name on the return address?
