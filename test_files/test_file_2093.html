    one of my packages hasnt arrived in 3 days and usually its next day/2 days max. i thought it had been held but then i ordered another item next day and it got through. but other packages of mine (not from sr) have been quite slow too, so im kinda hoping its general rather than interference. anyone confirm?

    Some mails as fast as usual some taking 3/4 times longer - id say there a problem with a certain network or distribution centre within royal mail.
    <br/>
    I feel for the vendors who must get slammed with mails asking where is......?
    <br/>
    If royal mail were as on the ball and organised as some of the vendors here then they would run like science fiction.

    Anyone any idea what sort of impact the olympics are going to have on domestic mail?

    Same here, I'm outside the UK but mail from the UK normally takes 10-12 days (incl weekends) to get to me but something that should have arrived by Tuesday is still not here. Something else sent around the same time but from a different country got here on Tuesday no worries. The UK item was sent just before the Jubilee holidays so I'm thinking that has delayed things a few days? Well, I'm really hoping it has and my goodies have not gone walkabout. Anyone else international who has ordered from the UK and goods posted at the beginning of June experiencing delays?
