    So I found an item that I may purchase once I get some bitcoins on here (new here, still figuring things out) but I have a couple shipping questions. I live with my rents still e.e so on where I could get it shipped too, could I put a place that isn't exactly a house? I have this trail and creek and bridge back where I live and that is where I usually meet my dealers for weed at but I know this is completely different. Or would I be able to ask it to be delivered in a specific time frame? ie while the rents are at work? Thanks guys!
    <br/>
    And also, this isn't the right place exactly, but how do I buy bitcoins. I don't have a paypal or stuff like that.. how do I buy it, I'm a bit confused?

    Simple answer is no. They will not have it delivered to a tree or an alleyway or to a hole in the side of your fence. If a letter said that it would cause suspicion with the post service, and most likely get confiscated. It's best to use a real name with a real address.  You could have it delivered to a friends/family house?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Google 'Mtgox' or  'Intersango'. It's really easy to open an account with them, and you fund the account via various ways, once you have money on the account with the website you can trade your money for BTC.

    Couldn't agree with you more AliBaba. There is a wealth of information available on these forums which I'm sure will answer any of your questions however you need to set aside some time to do some research of your own. It's so important that you inform yourself so you minimize your chances of making mistakes. All I'm saying is that before you ask a lot of questions, you should do some reading first. It was the first tip given to me and looking back, a valuable piece of advice. ;D

    I'll bite -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Re: living with your parents just bite the bullet dude and get it delivered to your home - make sure you're at your letterbox before your parents, otherwise just say the contents were a necklace or something from your ex-gf or another fairly light object.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Here's what I do: The very minimum you will need is an online banking account, with one of those PINsentry devices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a) sign up for a mtgox account using a disposable gmail/hotmail/tormail account.
    <br/>
    b) look up the FAQ for a UK bank wire deposit - write down the sort code, account name, number etc and your mtgox account number.
    <br/>
    c) sign into your online banking account and make the payment addressed to the above account name and details
    <br/>
    d) 1-2 days time you will see the amount credited in your account, now you can buy some bitcoins

    If you're worried about delivery to your home get a PO Box. Mine costs $37 for six months (USA) and USPS sends the renewal notices via email - no letters for your parents to see. Good luck and play safe.
