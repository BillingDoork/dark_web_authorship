    Hi All
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone order stuff from here even though they still live with your parents?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I still live at home (im over the age of 21 incase your thinking im a youngster) and i'm wondering will my parents get any hassle if the package was to be intercepted? The package will be addressed to me, amount will only be small 1gram substance, domestic

    You'll be fine bro, start learning how fast packages from places get to you. Be there when the package arrives, and never order when you wont be there. It's just mail, so really what can they say?

    I meant more on the lines of if police catch it - though since it will be such a small amount will they bother contacting owners of the house and question?

    If you are going to get it at home talk to the vendor and see if he will let you know what the letter is going to look like or what fake cover he is using. Many won't give out these details but if they do it will be a great help having a story ready in case questions are asked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advice would be to take some time and do some hard thinking, and you will be able to come up with a way to get it delivered elsewhere. There are plenty of creative ways to get something delivered to another address, especially if you are ordering domestic and you have a very small window of time to expect delivery.

    it sounds too me if you ordering shit to your parents. If small amount cops wise you will just get a letter not a Cd. but I do not mean to sound like a dick but maybe save up some of that order money and get a studio apt:) I mean its easy to save up when moms and dad pay the bills:) and im not knocking you i moved out when i was 19 and went to cali. but i know dudes mostly the pot heads that are in 30s still live in their moms basement to each their own but for real. im sure you;ll be fine

    +1 for the laugh!

    To OP, id probably research the vendors who are raved about for having great stealth and roll with them since you definitely cant be as risky considering your parents would be involved if there were a CD.

    just order domestic and say its a usb lead or flash drive off ebay if they ask questions. keep it simple! 1g domestic isn't going to have the police involved, there's no borders and rarely sniffer dogs or such like. my parents know my brother gets drugs to their house and they still pass them along stamped pharma indian postmark. it's illegal to tamper with other peoples mail but if you get caught it's on you not the homeowner.

    As long as your parents don't open your mail your fine and even if they sometimes do its really not that big of deal.
    <br/>
    Also there is tons of cool gadgets on ebay for only $1-2 which you could order around the same time you order your drugs which might help. (&lt;3 China)

    dude honestly,get another address like a friend whose house is clean or a po box. i got bail money saved so i couldnt care less about getting shit in my po box i use for bills and amzon items. dont put your family through the hassle of being questioned, they might slip up and say you have been getting packages regulary so someone is obviously trying to frame you. just say ftw and get a box. dont check it til after hrs,scope out any undercovers before you stop by,and always order from a reliable vendor.
