    Probably either got the pills already or is in jail.  Honestly, i can say with relative certainty that if they picked up that many bombs they'd definitely do a controlled delivery.  That's intent to distribute for sure!

    My understanding of it is love letters are more for personal amounts.

    Just speaking for myself personally, if I ordered 450 pills and I believed they got found by customs, I would be very concerned and take ALL precautions.  Better safe than sorry.  It would really suck if the vendor didn't send it and now you have to clean house.  Sort of insult to injury.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My personal belief is that whether you get a controlled delivery or not depends at least partially on where in the US you live.  I believe there is a higher probability if you live in a place that has a zealous local Narc police team with a not enough to do.  If you live in an area where these things are underfunded or the Narc squad is too busy, then you have less chance of a controlled delivery.  Again, this is just my gut feeling.  Take it FWIW, and since you got if for free...

    Personally, I think ordering bulk from the NL is just ridiculous anyways.. like.. what's the point. =/

    I wouldn't fuck with anything but domestic. What's the point in even risking customs?

    Just my 2 cents.

    Love letters are for small amounts of low scheduled drugs like xanax or grey area drugs like most research chemicals , and a few other things like marijuana seeds or paraphernalia ... I have never heard of a case of someone getting a letter saying "five MDMA pills were intercepted going to you, please stop getting drugs in the mail" let alone hundreds

    So if any schedule 1 drug is found it's unlikely you'll get a love letter?

    I can say for a fact that you can get a love letter for small amounts of schedule 1. Controlled deliveries are not as common as they once were. If the locals find out about it, they are more likely to do a knock and talk. NL is a high risk country, its best for USA people not to order from there.

    You have to remember that as soon as you start ordering from non-domestic vendors you are involved in international drug trafficking, which carries stiffer penalties.

    In essence Pablo Escobar simply arranged the shipping of packages from one country to another.. just on a much larger scale!

    450 tabs is a "kingpin" amount under some US state laws.  Makes you eligible for a life sentence.
