    Anyone else have a fucking retarded mailman that you just want to cut into a million little pieces with a pair of dull scissors?

    This stupid motherfucker doesn't even bother knocking on my door, he just sticks the package slip in my mailbox and walks away. Like wtf? This cocksucker has the package slip already filled out.
    <br/>
    Is there a special sticker I can put on my mailbox so that I don't have to sign for packages? Is there someone I should complain to or are all mailmen this fucking gay?

    I'm gonna spray water allover my sidewalks at night so that shit is super slippery the next morning. Hopefully that piece of shit falls and breaks his neck. (I'll just run up and slip the package out of his cold dead hands)

    I'm so glad I'm not the only one. If my car on the street is anywhere close to the mailbox, my mail lady will actually zoom (like insanely fly) past my box and look all pissed off driving down the street. I've literally gotten into my car, drove around the neighborhood, found her and asked her for my mail. Three times now. Like...uhm excuse me but wtf, you can't just NOT deliver any of my mail. It enrages me....
    <br/>
    I think I have a new mail person now or really...I'm not sure. It keeps alternating between this stoner looking guy and this bitch of a woman...I'm not really sure what's going on.
    <br/>
    Anyway...yes, dull scissor pieces of mail person sound very nice on some days...

    i had the same problem, Fucking retarded piece of shit mailman that used to have the package slips already filled out before he came to the door, I caught him one day and he didn't have an excuse, Called his manager and told him the guy was being a lazy motherfucker and not even bothering  to knock with the parcel, He never did my route again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but dunno if you'd wanna try it because it's SR packages, But maybe that would keep the fuckers away from your packages because they know they'l get fired if they fuck with your mail, as you've had a mailman fired before.

    I never hate the mailman unless I'm expecting a very important piece of mail. The thing I hate is how it seems like the mail always comes early when I'm not expecting anything. When I'm expecting something it feels like they take forever to get the mail to my fucking box but eventually it gets there . ::)

    i fucking hated my mail man. i was always nice to this asshole and he would always just drop my packages or not even put my mail in the box all the way almost about to fall out. or he wouldnt deliver my mail. and would just yell at me and say pick it up at the post office. well karma caught up to him after i complained to the manager. and he was walking one morning down the street and he walks in the middle of the street and steps in the gutter and slips and eats shit big time!! fucking best thing ive seen ever! he sits there for a little in the puddle gets up and looks around to see if anyone saw him. and me and my girl are busting up laughing at his ass. never seen him again after that

    At least you know it isn't a controlled delivery.  I'd think you could talk to your mailman and ask him to come to your door though.  Hopefully he'll comply rather than risk getting into trouble.

    Assertive action that's what we like to see! wtf is the go with not even trying to deliver the package? surely it takes more time to fill the slip out and stick that in the letter box than it does to deliver the fucking package. What a crack up reading people chasing down their posties and demanding their mail, I thought I was bad waiting but I'm yet to hunt them down  :P

    to the OP- correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't signing/ opening the door to a mailman a good way to get pinched? This was my understanding.. never sign, or open the door to the mailman. Let them leave the package at your front door.

    i had this happen to me lately with a legal order. i was waiting for it and i didnt hear the bell. all of the sudden a packet laying right infront of my door. i found this shocking! what if someone sees it and steal it? Had a similar thing a few years back when the postmen put a handy in our garden... first going in the garden without permission is not allowed second what happens if its raining all of the sudden and the handy gets damaged?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway, unless u have to get it from the toll (where u have to open the packet and explain what it is) its okay to sign i think. i would always do it but then again i never order big quantities from the net.

    While I understand your concern, look at the bright side of it:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    your envelope has made it through customs, that's a victory.
    <br/>
    even if it's domestic, it still made it through the mail system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as for a potential controlled delivery, did your envelope/package require signature?
    <br/>
    did it have a tracking number?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here in Canada they won't do this for regular mail that don't require signature or don't have tracking numbers....

    I had my mail-person going through my packages at my old place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I ordered a bunch of satanic items and black metal music from Austria since it seemed my mail-person was casing out of country mail items.
    <br/>
    After that my packages mysteriously arrived intact.

    Glad to see that this doesn't only  happen to me, lazy mailmen are everywhere it seems. Mine never bother getting to the 6th floor where I live, always leaves the notice in my mailbox, and I have to wait for the next day to be able to pick the mail up. But let's be compassionate, these guys have to be in a hurry most of the time I guess.

    @dinkastar ~ Yea this is very common (have been some other posts/threads about it too) and many mailmen clearly don't give a fuck.  Maybe they feel it's not their job to take a slip of paper back to their HQ...or maybe they don't want to bother to attempt delivery.  Don't be surprised by anything when you are relying on government employees.

    Is it registered mail (eg international)?  For registered mail you need to sign in person.

    Did you put the flag up on the mailbox?

    International registered mail requires an in-person signature in the US.  If your slip isn't checked that the signature must be collected in-person then the mailman made a mistake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    to request redelivery you're also supposed to go to the website listed on that form or call.  I can't remember if there is an option to request delivery by leaving the slip in the mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    without redelivery you're supposed to pick up from the post office.

    It's possible to avoid signing for signature required international packages. Perhaps some postal workers won't go along with it, but I've always had success. Just fill out and sign the slip properly for requesting redelivery, then call them up for the redelivery request and tell them to make a note that you've signed for the package and left your signature on the card in the mailbox but can't be home to be present for delivery. I've had an EMS package take over a week to get delivered, and it took many calls to USPS, but eventually they gave in and dropped it off in front of the door without anyone being home.
