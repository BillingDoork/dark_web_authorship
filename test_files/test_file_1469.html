    I've been trying to do research on this. As far as I can tell, it is probably one of the most dangerous hurdles in becoming a vendor on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best advice I found so far is buying a shelf company based on the postal inspection service thread. Has anyone tried this out with success so far? If so, what steps did you take in the corporation process in order to hide your identity? Did you use fake identities? Or have someone incorporate for you and buy the use of the corporation and its address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another question I had has to do with actually picking up the shipment. Assuming that there is nothing with the actual mailing address that can be linked to you, what steps do you take in safeguarding yourself on the actual pickup?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you guys use a Straw-man/Gopher, as in, someone to help you pick up your drugs? If so, what precautions and arrangements do you take in sourcing this person to ensure a robust organization structure that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, do any of you employ minors for above mentioned responsibility?

    Essentially, you're in a shitty situation when trying to receive any kind of sketchy things in the mail through a gopher.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On one hand, you don't want it to be someone with a lot of connections to you, who can easily be traced back to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other hand, you want to know that they're a reliable and trustworthy person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On one hand, you want it to be someone you don't give a shit about, since you're essentially using them as a human shield to avoid prosecution - you'd want someone who was a total piece of crap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other hand, you can't use someone who's a total piece of crap, because they'd just take the drugs and run. You'd need to trust them, and they'd need to trust you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless you're talking about having them make cash deposits to you, to be returned upon the arrival of the drugs - but then they could simply claim the drugs never came, and essentially pay you for them with the deposit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are a lot of complex factors involved - this is why vendors make a lot of money.
