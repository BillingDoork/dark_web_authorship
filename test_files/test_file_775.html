    The thing that pees me off is that bofore it was if you've had 5 successful transactions now it's 10 or 15 which is totally BS but their getting away with it anyway the thing I don't understand is there's been a flood of newbies who no doubt have ordered from the same vendor but out of 20 feedbacks only me and 1 other FE'd to this vendor which is why I was thinking selective scammer anyway tomorrow will be a week so I'll know for sure even though I know and feel I've been selectively scammed cos when I get from

    another vendor in the same place as this one it takes less than 48 hours to reach me but this ones been 1 week and nothing oh well I'll give it till wed the very latest then I'll tell everyone what vendor it is when I'm 110% I've been F,ed sideways so lesson learned but these vendors can do who they want when they want so someone lies and gets a reship and the vendor takes it out on someone else wtf man don't ever FE to no one you can't see = nor trust cheers people

    I would like to know the vendor's name. Though the fact that you're holding off on giving it, is commendable. I've been on this road 11 months, and was in the same predicament just before Christmas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes I will FE in certain instances. Escrow and Resolution have their drawbacks too. If you get a refund, it reflects negatively on your stats that future vendors look at. One vendor accused me of being a
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SCAMMER and wrote it in all caps in the resolution section, when all I was asking for was something to make up for the 20 something Valium that were crushed in shipping. I just finalized and left a 4 FB
    <br/>
    <br/>
    stating I wont be back. Oh well, you can't cry over spilled milk!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Feel free to PM me with the name of the vendor. I might have dealt with them. Not knowing who it was or what product and from where to where they are shipping, makes it difficult to give you advice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also how long it has been since you ordered. All these things are needed for me to give you an good answer based on my experience. Feel free to PM me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise, good luck! - Sit and wait. It's all a crap shoot on here. You stay long enough you'll get burned a few times. You have to just expect it. This isn't Amazon.con . There are no guarantees
    <br/>

    There's little you can do I'm afraid. However, the fact that the vendor is unresponsive does not necessarily mean he's trying to scam you. Some vendors are unresponsive by nature and either because of volume or because of laziness will not answer all messages. So keep your hopes up for the time being. If it does not arrive this week, I would suggest making a new thread about it and call the vendor out by name. In that manner you're both shaming them publicly (which they deserve) and also informing any prospective buyers to be wary and at least avoiding some other poor soul the grief you had to go through.

    I don't mean to come off like I'm attacking you so please don't take it that way - but the truth is that you gave him an easy way to scam you. You should NEVER finalize early (unless you're a new buyer, in which case I would perhaps be slightly sympathetic towards the vendor). But other than that, if you do FE, you're unnecessarily putting yourself at risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My personal policy is that I never FE for anyone. If I see a vendor is asking for FE, I look elsewhere. The risk is just too great. You need to understand that when you FE, you are agreeing to take all the risk. Vendors don't like to admit this but the truth is that they risk very little by using the escrow system. They will have some BTC tied up in escrow, so what? And the small percentage of buyers who are scammers does not justify asking everyone to FE. So a vendor risks nothing by using escrow but you risk everything by FE'ing. Think about that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If everyone agreed not to FE like I do, no vendor would dare ask for FE as they wouldn't get any business. But people persist in FE'ing and in the process continue giving vendors the power to demand early finalization.
