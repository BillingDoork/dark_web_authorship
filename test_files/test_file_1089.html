    So I found a customs letter in my PO box today. They have my identity on the video cameras, will the police ask them for this? What's the best course of action other than closing the PO box?

    Thank you in advance.

    Did you receive them in a PO box? Did you close the box after it or do nothing?

    There's no way to answer your question intelligently without knowing what the letter said.  Assuming you are from the US...If you received a
    <div class="quoteheader">

      Quote
     </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">

    </blockquote>
    <div class="quotefooter">
     <div class="botslice_quote">

    </div>
    letter from US Customs then most likely nothing more will come of it.  If the letter states you have 30 days to contest the seizure ....then you have no real worries about police action.

    Thanks for response. From UK. I just wondered if they would look for me to reoffend. The letter stated exactly what you said. No worries then.

    Do nothing and burn the PO box, shutting it down won't help you but just don't use it for anything illegal again. Too be honest if you are using a PO box in your own name you would e better of just ordering to your home address, at least that gives you some plausible deniability. Personally I would be doing neither.

    Get some safe drops mate not linked to you, it is the only way to go believe me.

    I considered a PO box a while back. A friend with a legitimate business uses one and receives weed through it at least once a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What put me off is the cost, UK boxes are not cheap. Money I don't need to  spend. Plus the plausible deniability thing using a home address makes more sense since you can't stop people posting things to you.
