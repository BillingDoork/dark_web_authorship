    Is there more risk ordering from overseas to the US?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will they do a controlled delivery if customs finds it or would I just get a note from customs saying they are destroying it?

    This question gets asked everyday and there is no definitive answer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it more risky to order from over-seas? YES! absolutely, you have to go through customs whose job is to inspect items destined for the USA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will you get a CD? POSSIBLY! there is no definitive answer for this one. You are much more likely to get a CD for a kilo of MDMA than you are for a few grams of marijuana. Neither are entirely out of the question though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Read the buyers guide to eliminate as much risk as possible.

    Ok,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the reply.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its so tempting to order MDMA from overseas because the price is great, but if the risk is significantly higher its not worth the savings.

    Order from Canada. I've had good success and I know others have as well. There were a few CDs of like 50-100g of MDMA from one vendor, but I think there was a flagging or a tip off that happened. It's been corrected and as far as I know it's been good for a number of months. The reseller I buy from sells for like $45/g and he has a flawless track record.

    I make it a habit to only buy illegal items domestically, but i will buy legal herbs or things used to smoke "legal herbs" from all around the world cause its cheaper, but for bud and mdma stick local, customs specific job is prevent drugs to enter the country, they do a pretty good job, but most priority domestic mail will never ever ever be searched, its all about peace of mind, do you want a better deal but worry about a controlled delivery or pay a little extra and have an extremely lower chance of getting busted by federales'

    YES! there is more risk when ordering from an international vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Someone mentioned Canada is ok. Not if you have to sign for the package. US carriers obtain signatures for Canada Expresspost deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I signed for a package from Pakistan last year. It looked it came from the dark ages. The carrier brought it to the door and had me sign for it.Â  Scared the shit out of me. The bare minimum of third world stealth. Over 100 ritalin.

    Recommend you source your meds domestically for less hassle and peace of mind.

    Of course customs makes the risk higher, but, if your only ordering small quantities and your vendor is experienced in the game, you should be OK. I've got some of the best C available from overseas. Bungee, Sukey, I've done multiple orders from these guys and my mail has arrived everything and the stealth is excellent.
