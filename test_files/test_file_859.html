    Hello.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in canada. I want to start selling SPEED's pills on SR. I get them at like 1$ each, i could easily sell alot on here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I need some info about the customs. I bought some eBook how to ship safe.. but it doesnt really answer my main questions...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you know if there is any X-Rays? If so, How do you guys pass them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If i send envloppe do they pass to X-Rays?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is the harder to pass, anyone know? Is it just the dog's ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you.

    I'm sure they have X-ray machines, but they wouldn't use them unless there is a smell coming from the envelope that the dogs picked up.
    <br/>
    Vacuum pack your stuff properly and you will be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They couldn't realistically x-ray every envelope, so make it look like normal mail and you'll have no problem !

    I buy the pill's in high quantity. I sell them in my town.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I discovered this place, I want to expend my activitys to online selling, considering i have low price, i think i could make good amount of money online. I will give some free sample to people for they see I have good pill's and to get known a little bit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But i'm worried about the custom's X-Ray's
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bought ebook how to ship, i read alot since some time now, the only thing I was unable to find is information about the XRAY's. How they decide to Xray an envlope? Is it automated or just selective? Do they XRAY all envloppe to/from canada? how it work? Is there country that are easier/harder to ship?

    You lost almost all credibility when you publicly announced how much you acquired your product for. That just is not done and leaves many questions a customer base does not want to have.

    are they ice speed pills?  I am a vendor and know a bit about shipping. Any amount under 100 pills or so is almost never going to be scanned, just make sure its vacuum sealed and your success rates with amounts under 100 internationally will be 95%+ and domestic will be 99.9% success.
    <br/>
    The last guy from Canada on here that sold speed pills put them in skittles/smarties packets not exactly a revolutionary idea but it worked I guess.
    <br/>
    Do something like this + seal them in mylar bags.

    I have always new brand, straight out of factory.

    I watched a documentary several months ago about pill buyers who get their stuff sent to the US from other countries.  The most relevant part to your question came at the end of the documentary.  Mail bound for the US goes through international postal facilities where it is X-rayed for contraband.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From what I could see the process looked very much like baggage X-rays at the airport.  EVERYTHING in the package was revealed to the person doing the screening. Hiding your product in cardboard or other types of padding is useless. Pills in a blister pack, for example, were easy to spot. I don't know if every package gets sent through the X-ray machine but it looked like many of them did.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.

    As I just posted here, Germany and France are working on a way to xray (they aren't really using x-rays though) every single packet and letter.
    <br/>
    This indicates that it isn't possible YET.

    there is some sort of paper with metal coating that is xray proof. can't remember what it is called though. using special protective envelopes is a bad idea. you want to distract from your package. this will make it extremely suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the task is getting past the customs without being noticed. not building some fancy packaging that customs will lol at when opening. your opponent does this shit for a living, every day. keep that in mind.

    I could be wrong but I believe that I read somewhere that the US customs only X-ray boxes on a consistent basis and that they simply don't have the resources to X-Ray every single envelope. so they only X-ray suspicious envelopes that have been flagged for some other reason. (I am sure that this can also be extrapolated to other countries customs methods. At least to some extent. Especially since US customs are considered the hardest around)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The general rule though, is that the quicker the shipping method, the less likely they will have time to even check it.
    <br/>
    So I would make Overnight/Express shipping options an imperative with bulk amounts (don't even offer the option for a slower/cheaper shipping method on your bulk listings)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I could be wrong but i think that mylar bags allow a certain amount of protection against X-Rays
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my 0.02 BTC on the matter

    I thought that Scandinavian customs are the "best". You will find a lot of bitching from Scandinavians about nothing getting through and no one shipping to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    About the customs, that's pretty simple actually. Think like a customs officer, you are paid to find illegal or possibly harmful packages. The more and the bigger the hit the better (I think they actually get bonuses for big finds). Everyone who once had a summer job as mail man, has a small glimpse of what volume must go through customs every day. So what they try to do is filter all legit packages, so those they are searching actually contain something illegal and are worth the effort. They want that every packages they search contains something that's worth searching for. That's what they are paid for. The X-Ray is there to up the efficiency. Really nothing special here, they just optimize their workflow as best as they can to achieve their goal.

    ^^^ Exactly^^^
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as a result of this process, about 95%+ of regular legitimate looking letters are filtered as well as most of the packages that look like a legitimate business package (ebay, amazon, mouser, etc....)
