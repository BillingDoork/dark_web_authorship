    Are drug dogs trained to smell for magic mushrooms? Wouldnt the dog indicate at every package that had legitimate mushrooms in them (say from a gourmet food supplier)?

    Law enforcement scent kits for training do not even contain anything for mushrooms.  You would have to find a distinguishable substance in psilocybin mushrooms that the dog can smell or your dog would alert on any and every type of mushroom.

    There is, its just either difficult to produce for traning (you have to train on the scent they need to single out, not on the item itself), or not practical. I'd lean on the latter side. I could only speculate as to why it isn't practical, but I suppose the inference stems from the lack of empiracle evidence that shrooms were the driving cause behind a bust ... ever, in all the time i spend reading the news.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do think that while in some ways we can easily say how misguided it is and how forceful they are on the wrong subastances (or, at the very least, the wrong non-violent people), law enforcement does make some assumptions. Ultimately, even myself, I love shrooms - they are my favorite weekend getaway - but in my mind I still identify them as a highschool substance. That kind of thing where I'm slightly feeling mischeivious but... not entirely dastardly. I considered it my practice to get over the nervous jitters of doing something altering, so that I could enjoy LSD without freaking out about something that wasn't coming after me. In the end I came to the conclusion I was an idiot for doing that and I shouldn't have been afraid in the first place... but it was a good excuse at the time and I discovered quite a bit about myself in those days :P

    I dont think they can distinguish the Psilocybin. The mushroom, yes but not the Psilocybin. I have tried, I know several trainers that have tried and it just does not work.
    <br/>
    I think the biggest part is that Psilocybin degrades quickly in oxygen, it is just not stable enough to give off a scent in my opinion.

    Perhaps a controlled extraction and containment of the active psilocybin with correct pH buffering immediately after or during the extraction phase. Then if it's true that the chemical is unstable and sensitive to oxidation, this needs to be addressed via cntrolled air space (perhaps in argon gas or nitrogen), at a controlled temperature (liekly around a fridge temperature or possibly below freezing, I don't know much about psiloocybin as many fo the replies, but these are things to consider if your persistence won't get you down.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can assure you it is psiloocybin to isolate the psilocybin as it is currently being used under licence in a clinical study of (I believe, if memory serves), terminally ill patients in a therapeutic environment/setting. The clinial test is not to be mistaken with the phenominal results yielded by the well known Swiss study of :SD on termanally ill.. depressed patients. For those unfamiliar the conclusion of the test (which s document by Vice I believe and can be found with a simple youtube search.) was psoitive in eery case in teh cntrolled therapeutic setttin that was performed by very down to earth scientists with a great degree of empathy (Which I think can make or break the vibe felt from the trip.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully these scientists are friendly to a degree and kno that they shouldn't be d bags, unless of cor\urse its a set up to yield negative results. That would be greed at its worst and put humanity to shame, to disprove an effective remedy for the terminally ill to accept death and have a positive end-of-life experience and positive perspective.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a user of both mushrooms and LSD (been years), I, and many others who've tried both say that LSD is far more stable in emotional effects after the peak is reached 1.5-2hours post-ingestion. On the come up, tho is where you msut be careful to surrround yourself with positive people you trust in a comfortable atmosphere (I suggest turning your phone and communications of in case of terrible news - such as death/injury of a loved one or a disaster, whether an act of God or humanity).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After this peak is over pre-tested MDMA helps secure you in a positive trip, where even disturbign things are positively amusing and fallible. i found that is not the case with shrooms, where my mood goes from strange ina neutral way to deranged and delusional, to intrigued by patterns on surfaces in seconds. And although te trip cold be shorter, LSD is my choice anyday over shrooms and I ill never do shrooms in a dose greater than 3g with lots of liquor and benzos on the ready. YMMV, but I think overall the pharmacology of LSD is more stable in most individuals due to its ability to maintain a steady blood serum level unlike psilocine which has more reported side effects at comparable dose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do isolate the psilocybin, expect to get rich, and for extra precaution and to stay out of jail, commisssion a chinese cheical manufacturer with a god reputation to produce it for you. They'll even grow the muhrooms if given teh right money and instructions. Worried about the condition of th palnt your commissionng? There are many Chinese inspectors that can be hired to inspect the sterility and safe health practices of the plant in question (This is highly suggested as these inspectors can inspect a medium sized plant capable of producing 50-20kg of generally easily synthesized chemicals at high purity rates for a fe less than $200, with a report written on what you specified for inspection. If the plant manager doesn't want to allow an inspection to occur, cease contacts and find one that would be happy to have an inspector come in, after mentioning high monthly import quantities and payments.) So forget the whole initial dog idea and get a plant commissioned to do your lab work!

       There is, its just either difficult to produce for traning (you have to train on the scent they need to single out, not on the item itself), or not practical. I'd lean on the latter side. I could only speculate as to why it isn't practical, but I suppose the inference stems from the lack of empiracle evidence that shrooms were the driving cause behind a bust ... ever, in all the time i spend reading the news.

      I dont think they can distinguish the Psilocybin. The mushroom, yes but not the Psilocybin. I have tried, I know several trainers that have tried and it just does not work.
      <br/>
      I think the biggest part is that Psilocybin degrades quickly in oxygen, it is just not stable enough to give off a scent in my opinion.

    Mushrooms in general all degrade in the presence of oxygen. If you don't store them properly even when dried they degrade rather quickly. That goes for all organic matter, once normal metabolism is done oxidation is a rather quick process. If they are stored properly, I don't think a dog would find them to begin with, and I would bet that in drying the constiuants would become a bit more potent, scent wise, at least to a dog. I mean, I've eaten and smelled many, both culinary and psilocybe producing, shrooms are different, at least in a dried form. I find portabella to have a more fruity smell, shitake tend to have a more ginger like smell. Truffles wouldn't be what they are if they weren't.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But, that just goes back to the original point. I don't think it would be practical. The optimal storage for keeping is the same as all other organics, even spices... no light, no air, no moisture, preferably cold. That type of environment would limit the ability of the dog to begin with. Isolating it, in order to search for it, wouldn't yield much as a return for the training process I feel. I mean, I could understand the novelty in having a dog that could find them in a field for you, and in that particular case I could very easily see how that would not succeed as often... their typical location isn't exactly devoid of scent in the wild. But, in an unnatural place... indoors, or in a specifically engineered cultivating area?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then again I could just be crazy, or perhaps its a counter to the adaptation of canines in and of itself. I don't know, I simply say this from a basis outside of the canine itself. There aren't many physical objects that are truly odorless, and since odor is driven by a chemical process I find it hard to believe that one family of fungi would be exactly identical to another, especially when the growth medium tends to be different in a very, very diverse manner. "We are what we eat" after all.

    Dogs are trained to find truffles  :) Not sure if that means its possible to have them be trained to find mushrooms. You can train yourself to find them though! Just takes the right area of the country during the right season!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as dogs being trained to smell mushrooms, I don't believe they almost ever are. I know a friend of mine was importing mushrooms from the pacific north west to the Midwest through the mail.  He never ran into any problems, even with 2-3 lbs. at a time. The only difficulty with mailing them is that they are fairly bulky, even in comparison to bud. Id recommend a single layer MBB with no vac seal layer, put in a box and disguised as some other product. Just treat it like transporting pot and you'll be fine! Best of luck!

    not exactly. It's not cow shit itself, but rather a growth that comes out of it, which is a little different. Even tho most indoor growers use things like sterilized rice cakes, the cubensis mushroom still has it in the DNA and can't really be changed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so it's not really cow shit, but the specific species that this one dog, at least, was trained for
    <br/>
    <br/>
    many different species of mushrooms have their own unique smell. Cubensis is just one species. It's the same thing as training pigs to look for truffles in Italy

    No dogs would not be trained to sniff out magic mushrooms but if you are sloppy and leave your mushrooms around MDMA, marijuana, ketamine etc... then for sure. Any trsces of other drugs on your baggie of mushrooms is more than enough for a dog to pick up a scent that leads to a physical search.
    <br/>

    Moral of the story, dont mix your "harmless" psychedelics with other illegal mainstream drugs.

    yep, that is probably more likely that mushrooms caught with dogs would be because of cross contamination with other chemicals
    <br/>
    <br/>
    these other chemicals like mdma, ketamine, speed, coke, etc are like 10000 times more common than mushrooms and much stronger smelling...and weed too
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just being in the same room with dank weed while packaging would probably set a mushroom package off. Mushrooms are just too far down the scale to spend the effort to go after it and it'll always be like that because mushrooms are very difficult to produce in quantities large enough to compete with these man made chemicals and weed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nevertheless, I still vacuum in MBB bags and so do other shroom vendors. It's a good idea anyway

    Please post the link. I keep up with stuff like this and never heard the story. The one I remember the guys had weed and mushrooms but the mushrooms made the bigger headline.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ps. Cubensis is a secondary composter. It grows on cow piles that have begun breaking down. If you try to grow them on fresh cow feces they fail. Indoor growers use a variety of substrates from BRF (Brown Rice Flower) cakes to mixtures of composted cow manure and coca core.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You will also find that Agaricus bisporus which is the common white mushroom used on pizza is also a secondary composter and is often grown on compost that contains some cow manure. This exact same mushroom when fully grown is referred to as a portabella.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ill also add that I have tried many times to train my dog to find Ps. Cubensis. It would be a huge boon for me to be able to easily find fresh specimens. I could isolate the sub-strains from a wild and begin producing new strains for sale. It just does not work, I know a few professional trainers one of which used to buy mushrooms from be for her personal use. She even gave it a try and it seems that it is not possible to train the dog to find them. Some one on here suggested that using a pure Psilocyben extract may work better but the extracts degrade so fast that there is little time to use them in training.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, there is a theoretical possibility that you could train a dog to find psilocyben but it is a virtual improbability that you could get it reliable.

    here's the link and copied below. It is correct that cubensis is a secondary composter. Psilocybe semilanceata (liberty caps) is another secondary decomposer and only grows out of cow fields after the dung has decomposed after some years. It does not grow directly out of fresh cow dung. nevertheless, both cubensis and liberty caps are strong smelling and have their own unique smell. liberty caps will get really smelly within hours if you don't dry them out right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway, it's still rare for dogs to be trained on mushrooms and even then it would be for a specific species. Mushroom busts themselves are relatively rare compared with more common drugs. Also note how many security mistakes were made compared what is standard for SR shipping practices. He probably used food grade or less plastic bags too. It might have been contaminated with other things, etc . 3000 grams is a big fucking package for shrooms (that's like the size and weight of a small refrigerator)..they may not have been dried completely, and maybe stunk to high heaven..

Bennett sentenced George Victor Kraft, age 34, of Baltimore, today to 13 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute psilocybin, also known as psychedelic mushrooms, announced United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein. Judge Bennett enhanced Kraft’s sentence upon finding that he was a career criminal based on a previous felony drug conviction and a conviction for attempted armed robbery.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to his guilty plea, on November 13, 2008, postal inspectors at the mail facility in Linthicum Heights, Maryland inspected a parcel that had a return address which did not exist and which was addressed to a person who was not known at the recipient’s address. After a drug sniffing dog alerted on the parcel, the parcel was searched and 10 individually wrapped, vacuum-sealed plastic bags containing brown mushroom-like vegetation were found. The substance tested positive for psilocybin, and a postal alert device was placed inside the parcel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The next day, an undercover postal inspector delivered the parcel to the address written on the package, a residence on South Ann Street in Baltimore. A woman accepted the package. A few hours later, Kraft and another man arrived at the residence and within minutes the beeper inside the parcel alerted that the parcel had been opened. Law enforcement agents searched the residence and found the opened parcel containing 3,564.5 grams of mushrooms containing psilocybin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    United States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein thanked the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Baltimore City Police Department, the Anne Arundel County Police Department and the Maryland State Police for their investigative work. Mr. Rosenstein commended Assistant United States Attorney Christopher J. Romano, who prosecuted the case.

    Ok, I looked up the record on this. I dont think that the dog was alerting on the mushrooms.

    We will start with the fact that it was a plain brown box 16"x16"x16" with an express Mail sticker, hand written label, and $64.60 in postage attached. Going to a fake name "John Fudde" and the return address was fake and did not exist.
    <br/>
    That is why the package was pulled as stated in section 8 of the above link.

    Sections 10 and 11 (Quoted above) are the facts of the case. They wrapped 10lbs of vacuum sealed mushroom in a bed sheet. Bed sheets hold scents extremely well, Do you honestly believe that they used a new bed sheet? or even a clean one? I would bet they were smoking a blunt and wrapping the mushrooms.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am surprised that they have a field test for Psilocybin, I did not even know there was one.

    I agree with most of this. and it's worth exploring further. Some background on mushrooms and psychedelic species, reference, scientific Mushroom Observer
    <br/>

    the smell for ALL psychedelic species is described as "farinaceous"...You can look that up on Wiki too. The problem is this word is used to describe something that almost can't be described. It's very unique and once you smell it, you know. It is an organic smell and it's part of nature and has been so for eons
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Furthermore, some newly named psychedelic species have an even more unique smell like flowers, &gt; psilocybe ovoideocystidiata which grows in the Ohio river valley just about this time of year. Most of these species, except for psilocybe cubensis is rare, which means it's very very difficult to train dogs on if they can't even get samples of it
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if there WAS any dogs trained on shrooms, it would be for cubensis, and I'm pretty sure it's possible to do this if people can train pigs to look for truffles. The problem is it takes a long time to do this and I doubt it's worth the effort for the once in a lifetime 10 pound bust
    <br/>
    <br/>
    chemicals on the other hand, are much easier to train dogs on, because that is entirely inorganic and basically it's like toxic shock syndrome to a dogs nose, like stinging nettles. BTW weed, as we know it today, is also easy for a dog because it's no longer the hemp of generation past and has been selectively bred for potency and strong smell
    <br/>
    <br/>
    mushrooms don't work like that but they do have their own smell. That's one of the reasons why, if you find a vendor you can trust, even if it has to be powdered for stealth, it will always still have the same smell, so after awhile with experience, you will know the authenticity of the powder partly from the smell. Nobody's found a way to fake that yet and people have actually mentioned the smell in my feedback. In fact, relatd species under their own clade, or branch of classified psychedelics all have a similar smell, so that p cyanescens, p allenii, p azurescens, p subaeruginosa (australia), p serbica (europe) &gt; wood decomposers are genetically related and have a similar smell and this is world wide so it doesn't matter who is vending it, it will still have the same or similar smell, if it's authentic
    <br/>
    <br/>
    p cubensis has its own branch or clade, and that is the dung decomposers and that has a different smell than the wood decomposers (yes it may be secondary, but it's still dung related)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    p subaeruginascens from japan and it's newly named  and related p oviodeocystidiata in the Ohio river valley is yet another and complete different wood decomposer branch that has yet another smell
    <br/>
    <br/>
    classification and science of mushrooms is currently being reorganized based on genetic ID, but even so for experience people with a nose, one can sort much of it out via smell. (btw, even in a powder form, if you really want to find out the truth, scientifically speaking, you can still ID species with a microscope and spore shape and size. spores are too small to be chopped up in a blender and are smaller than even the finest powder that humans can make - so that no matter how fine the powder, if you look around long enough with a microscope, you'll find spores in there) &lt; if it's authentic
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If experienced people with a nose can ID shrooms as authentic, then so can dogs, just sayin
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But is it's hardly worth the time and effort because it's so rare compared to all this other stuff going around these days. The more chemicals that keep getting invented, the further down the priority list organic shrooms go
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also, what's even worse now and this'll really blow your mind. Some of these wood inhabiting psychedelic species are spreading into landscaping that includes the landscaping of police departments. Wood chip landscaping is getting popular with the government agencies these days in an effort to be 'green' at all levels, local, state and federal and it's starting to show up ,literally within inches of their office windows
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I kid you not. This of course means that as it spreads even further year after year, any dogs that 'could' be trained on it will eventually have to be decommissioned due to the confusion of that smell occurring outside their own office
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it is the cosmic joke and it's all true )

     Farinaceous or mealy. Often compared to the odor of cucumbers, watermelon rind, or an old grain mill. Common in many mushrooms, including Polyporus squamosus, Agrocybe praecox, Mycena galericulata, Tricholoma sejunctum, Clitopilus prunulus, and Entoloma abortivum. Some mycologists (Smith et al., 1979; Moser, 1983), armed with better sniffers than mine, subdivide "farinaceous" into three odor groups: strictly farinaceous, cucumber/farinaceous, and rancid-oily-fishy/farinaceous. Believe it or not, the cucumber/farinaceous sub-odor has been upheld by chemical research (Wood et al., 1994) as a valid distinction, and the chemical trans-2-Nonenal has been identified as being responsible for it.

    The Ps. Cubensis smell is generally described as a common mushroom smell. Although not specifically listed in the above citation it is also the smell of many of the Boletus species which are choice edibles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some one has asked about a scent bag to train the dog on, you could try trans-2-Nonenal as the scent but that is the scent of the mushroom and not the active ingredient psilocybin.

    cubensis smelling like boletes might be because people aren't experienced enough. I can smell the difference between cyans and cubensis. Some people have descibed cyanescens smell as being like an edible wood mushroom as well
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but that could be because different people interpret the smell different ways. Kind of like not everybody sees the same exact color
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess that would be an example of how difficult it is unless you have a lot of experience, and it would probably be the same for dogs too. Alot of wild mushrooms spread themselves by being attractive smelling to animals and insects
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://herbarium.usu.edu/fungi/funfacts/truffind.htm
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Squirrels and insects are attracted to fungi which then nibble on them and become contaminated with spores and thus spread the spores. This happens all the time with wild p cyanescwns where you can find photos of cyanescnes with tiny little teeth marks in them, like caterpillars have been munching on them
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's not a new concept that many mushrooms make themselves attractive to wild life to spread themselves, but it is relatively new to try to exploit that with dog searches. It's hard to find proof that actually happens, but I'm guessing it's possible. Difficult, but possible
