    Hey Guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are your opinion about shipping and receiving edibles internationally? Is it generally pretty safe as the smell is already masked by the cookie/brownie that it's made into? What are the risks for it going through customs and has anybody have it been intercepted before?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help would be greatly appreciated
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    i was wondering this myself - i would assume that if you cooked it well (boil water butter and herbs together and filter out the butter) that the smell as minimal as it can get.Â  Additionally, if a dog sniffed out a dozen cookies, would LE destroy the cookies?

    If there's THC in it, it's definitely going to smell like weed to a dog. Hell, humans can usually smell the bud in edibles if you put your nose close enough to it, but they still can't get dogs to sniff out every package that goes through customs, far from it most likely. If you order from a reputable seller though, I'm sure they will take appropriate precautions as far as packaging goes. Check their feedback and search for them in the forum. I would guess that things can get a little weird when dealing with edibles as oppose to raw cannabis depending on where you are, but even if shit does hit the fan, the worst thing that will probably happen is you getting a letter from customs saying that what was being shipped to you was illegal.

    Just PM the vendor you are looking to go with, and ask if your stuff is to be vacuum sealed, if no, i dont suggest you order with them. As stated dogs can and will smell the cannabis in the edibles if presented with task. A drug sniffing dog will detect even the residual scent of marijuana if the individual who packaged the goods didnt properly sanitize their hands before handling the sealed, ready to mail product. Good luck friend
