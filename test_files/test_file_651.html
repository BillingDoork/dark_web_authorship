    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor one is BS'ing around with tracking and wont respond

    <br/>
    vendor two is spooked thinking i'm LE and wont tell me which state he ships from so I can verify.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Is it the same product for each order? and same amounts?
    <br/>
    If so..maybe tell the vendor the last 4 digits on tracking # and make them match it up or something.

    Message both vendors and explain your predicament. Ask if they can tell you something to identify their package. Let them decide what to tell you about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next time change something about how you send your address for separate vendors shipping concurrently. For example, one written normally, and the other with all caps.

    Got rid of the packaging. I always do once I verify the amount. Only thing I remember from the package is the city and state.

    I always use different names if the product is exactly the same. That tells me who sent what package.

    The other should arrive pretty soon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assuming they are not about to auto finalize, I would simply wait a few days for the other package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That would solve it both way's.   U may be fuss'ing over nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And yes..... they mean the thing it came in.
