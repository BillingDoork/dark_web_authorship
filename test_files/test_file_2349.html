    True, you shouldn't have it delivered to your school, but in the worst case scenario, couldn't they just deny knowledge of the package. I mean, after all, that has always been the security that we have had through postal dealings. For all they know, someone else in the dorm (or wherever) used your name and school address to try and intercept the package or something. It wouldn't be the greatest idea for this "other person" to do, but people are stupid and you never know what some people may do. I have heard of many people that scout out addresses of random strangers to use as their drop address and they wait for the day that the mailman arrives with the goods and they intercept it. Just my two cents.

    Depending on your school it could be as safe as getting a pack to your APT off campus...but how safe it is is all dependent on multiple factors...
    <br/>
    1. RA's. I have been told that if you get a package to your dorm it is not uncommon for an RA to sign for and open your package for nothing else besides he wanted to know what was in it.
    <br/>
    2. The SCHOOLS drug policy. For example if you were to get caught with a bag of weed at say University of Illinois Chicago they take it from you thats it. But at Depaul University in the very same city they have a ZERO tolerance drug policy so you really dont wanna get fucked there

    I'm absolutely a proponent of education and the value it has on the future of... everyone. But also wanted to chime in and say that we've sent multiple packages to dorms all over the country without any issue. Just do your research on the vendor and try to get an idea of packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, it would absolutely be more wise to get a PO box. Your call.

    I have to agree with the majority of posters in this thread. I wouldn't risk it in my opinion. Especially when I can just do what other posters said and go make a P.O. Box and receive the packages their stealthily. Same fun, more secure &amp; safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do feel confident enough, then as long as you use a good vendor that packages his stuff good then you should be fine. It also kind of depends on what you order. You could probably hide some powder better than an ounce of weed. Both mass and stench.

    this is my first post in ten months due to unrelated issues but i had several packages mailed to a dorm last year without any issue
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i just ordered all from inside my country (i think) and did my best to make sure vendors were legit before going through with it....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i also knew at my school that they dont meticulously go through the mail and just sort it into the various mailboxes
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but yes...dont fuck around or half-ass it if youre getting it delivered to a dorm

    Not to beat a dead horse but open a P.O. Box or a box at a UPS store.  This is very east and common in college towns.  You live with someone you don't trust with your mail if anyone asks, which they won't even.  If you get popped with a off campus package you won't get expelled and end up in the school newspaper.  Always minimize your risks and do everything you can to keep from getting caught.

    When "uncertainty" comes into play with something you need under control, it's time to consider a system with more "certainty" (certainty of no policies you may be affected by, certainty of your ability to deny, certainty of your system working enough to get your product 99.9% of the time.) Get a PO box, use a business name for it and have a business idea in mind that you're starting for smalltalk with the PO operators.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have mail addressed to your business name (not a person's name) with the PO address. Try to order domestic, and realize that a few hundred dollars to protect your privacy and safety is peanuts when your playing on a busy Road. You're in the US and the DEA is no joke (only the fact that they exist is a joke). Do all the research you can and negate your uncertainty.
