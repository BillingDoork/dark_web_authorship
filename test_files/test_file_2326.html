    Hey everyone. I had a package shipped to me a week and a half ago that I have not received. I contacted the vendor and he claims to have tracked the package, and that it was delivered on schedule. I asked the vendor for the dcn so I can attempt to locate the package, but he hasn’t responded yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What is the worst that could happen if someone else opened my package and saw the contents? Could they contact the police and have me arrested? I have been so worried over the past few days that I have not been able to function properly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, should I ask for a refund? I’ve never had a problem with a silk road delivery before, so I’m not really sure of the best thing to do.

    Could be the vendor is dishonest and never sent the package. You'll know for sure if he doesn't send you the DCN. If he tells you he won't send it for security reasons or gives you any other bullshit excuse, you'll know he's lying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think they could have you arrested especially since the product was never actually shipped to you. It was shipped to somebody else so what could they arrest you for?

    There are many variables here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Did you Finalize Early? (sounds like you have but just confirming with you).
    <br/>
    2. Did you use your real name or a fake one?
    <br/>
    3. Which country do you live in?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you Finalized Early, your only remaining hope is the vendor doing something for you on their own accord. Unfortunately, once an order is Finalized, it's Final. SR won't intervene as the transaction is complete as far as they are concerned. This is the reason you should always use the Escrow system. If the vendor insists you have to FE, ask for your order to be cancelled and go with another vendor who allows the use of Escrow for newer buyers. If a problem occurs during your transaction and 10 days have passed since your order was put in transit, you then have the opportunity to open up a dispute in the Resolution Center, where you can either request a time extension for the delivery of your order, which effectively will delay your payment to the vendor until your item arrives should it turn up a little later than expected, or request a full or partial refund. SR Support will look at any evidence and make a decision on the matter if the vendor and yourself can't reach an agreement.  :)

    Thanks for the replies. I have not finalized, and I have opened a dispute in the resolution center. I used my real name for the shipment and I live in the United States.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I asked the vendor for the dcn, but he is saying that he already deleted the dcn, which means there is no way for me to locate my package. I think it's time to ask for a refund. Would asking for a 50% refund be more appropriate in this case or should I try for 100%?
