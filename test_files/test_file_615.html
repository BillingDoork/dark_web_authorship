    So there is quite a big community when It comes to DIY drones. Nowadays it's getting easier to build your own UAV. This is a bit of a broad question, but I was wondering If anyone see's a future in Drone drug deliveries. Keep in mind, Drones can be small, quiet, and fly a few hundred feet in the air so radar detection might prove to be a bit more difficult. What does everyone think?

    Not really because a long range drone would be quite expensive to build. With the FPV gear available today you can set gps co ords to return to home if you lose signal but i don't think it possible to set gps drop offs and returns plus you are limited to range if you are going to fly the thing fpv yourself. To build a fully autonomous drone would cost a fuckton and just wouldn't be practical not to mention if you lose it you're "payload" would be compromised if still onboard and you prints and DNA would also be all over the thing if you built it yourself like i would.

    Yes, I definitely see a future here.

    Swarming is the future, with drones being one of its physical manifestations:

    As soon as Drones are sold @ SR we will plaster all clubs with QR code stickers on the toilets. Those will lead to a customized liberte linux directly leading to our Profile here on boot lol   every 5th order gets a tor relay raspberry pi for free hahah
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We see no problem with 25km limited range :)  it still makes GPS drops feasible and even more secure ...!

    Hail SR and Hail the future !

    i have looked into drones, the prices for a drone that can carry a payload of 30lbs and a range of 50+ miles was like 150k almost all the cost was in the electronics needed to pilot the thing over long distance.  much more expensive than the semi subs for the volume of drugs they can transport.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if you mean like small ones for daily house to house deliveries with several miles range that would be kinda cool but probably attract more attention.

    It is possible for GPS drop off and return, you could build it with gloves on, you will lose your payload if any shipment method is compromised.
