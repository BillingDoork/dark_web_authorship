    I am admittedly relatively new here, so this question has probably been asked before. I'm going to take a shot at it anyway, sorry in advance for any paranoia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been wondering how safe it is to continuously use the same packaging methods and stealth through the course of all of your shipments as a vendor. My concern is that it is possible that once one or two packages get seized, the government could then be looking for packages that look the exact same. The DEA could even make orders themselves to get an understanding of what to look for. Nothing could really prevent them from doing so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they then figure out that all or most of the packages sent from that address/business have drugs, then they could start looking for where they are being sorted/sent from. They could even go as far as to just sit, track, and wait for a number of known contraband packages to be delivered and then eventually attempt to bust all of those individual recipients. I know the ability to acquire a warrant is a bit harder for the last situation, but it really could be possible
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TL;DR:
    <br/>
    What is preventing the DEA from ordering from the SR, investigating shipping methods, and then flagging all similar packages? Furthermore, what is the chance this could lead into a massive bust?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Discuss.

    I know they do for international packages from some countries somewhere in the US postal system.  I received the same packaging from a certain country for four years.  They seized 15% or more of them.  They were very stealthy.  It always seemed like some days they didn't get laid last night and felt like being a dick and taking my shit but most of the time I got them.  It was always the department of homeland security that notified me of my seizures, not the DEA.

    You have to assume you are on some list of sorts, right? Do you still ship to the same place after multiple seizures?

    What's preventing it is that millions of packages are handled a day.  A day?  Or a year... fuck, I'm totally spacing on which is right.  Whatever, the principle is correct even if the numbers aren't.  The outside of almost all packages look alike, and if you get to the stage where they're already past the outside, the game's basically up -- you're gonna have a hard time stealthing your way out of a search-warrant-thorough search.

    I know I am.  I used to do that in the past.  It depends on what was seized.  If it's a schedule 1 or 2 then I do not continue to use that address.

    One of the countries I use sends out less than sends 300 or less packages into the United States a day through the delivery service and option that I use.  I have only had one controlled delivery from there though.

    SS is right there are billions of packages a year sent thru the USPS. They do not have enough postal inspectors/customs agents to look for all. even if they bust one vendors stealth who is shipping 1 or 5 grams at a time, they will not profile his packs because its not worth it for them. they are looking for the big fish, the kilo or 500 gram orders. if they bust a kilo order, you betcha they're gonna profile every package that looks the same as that one!

    the reason they send a "love letter" from customs is because you sent enough drugs in the mail to piss them off, but they dont have time or resources to bust you or do anyhting about it.. so they send you a "cease and desist" style letter. theyll probably flag your adddress before they progile types of packages..
