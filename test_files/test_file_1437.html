    so my mom recently moved in with me and she has been checking my mail every day because she is expecting something to arrive as well. I am going to open a PO box with USPS using my real name and connected to my address. should i be worried about doing this? (i only receive personal use amounts) my other question is: how can i get junk mail sent to my PO box? i want to make a small amount of junk mail to arrive with my drugs because i think this will make it look less suspicious. what do you guys think? any thoughts? suggestions?Â  thanks

    Sign up for mailing lists. Also, tell your mom to stop opening your mail. Without your permission, that is technically a felony... I think. Being your mother, if you are under 18, it is probably permissible. If you are over 18, the same rules apply to it as to all mail tampering.

    If your mum is living in YOUR place, then she should be respecting your privacy. No need to get a po box, just explain nicely that you expect to keep your privacy if she wants to stay with you.

    The whole junk mail topic has come up before and someone with knowledge of the inner workings of the PO revealed that junk mail takes a very different route than real mail. The junk wont even cross the path of those who might intercept your goods, so junk mail is a waste of your time. Better to go on ebay and order several cheap trinkets in small packages instead (for example many plastic cell phone covers are under a dollar).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously, the PO will know your real identity when you get the box, but also register your box with a fake business name. I did this and mail is deliverable to both my name and the business name. As is well-known, packages addressed to a business name are much less suspicious and less likely to be screened. Since most sellers use fake business names too, it looks like a business-to-business package, so that's even better. I use a technology-sounding company name, so if anyone asks, I have a side business of repairing phones and ipods that people are shipping to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even the smallest, cheapest PO box is more than big enough to fit an 8th of weed (at least at my PO), so they will just leave it in there instead of putting a slip in and making you pickup at the customer service desk. Though a few times I did get the slip with bigger packages and I was a nervous nelly going to the counter to pick it up, but it always went just fine.

    If you want small packages and a catalog:
    <br/>
    Uline (uline.com) will send you their magazine in the mail, and they're a very excellent company to do business with.
    <br/>
    When I was looking for a supplier of bags (not for drugs) I asked them for several samples of different sizes and different closures and they shipped me box after box full of samples. (I did eventually place a larger order)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you just want fliers and mailer style, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Kohl's will flood your mailbox if you sign up for their mailing promotions. (Coupons, vouchers)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, local pizza places often offer mailers because they're cheap and effective marketing, and you can have menus for when you do order pizza ;) The good thing about having diverse mail is it looks like you're actually using your PO box for things other than just receiving small boxes. Something like "I'm waiting to close on a my first home purchase and I need a PO box" is a good counter-conversation for the initial opening. If nothing else, to introduce yourself to the employee behind the counter. This may or may not work for your area but in a non-populous area, this works very well. It's usually 1 or 2 people who run the place and they kinda know all the people "in town".

    They aren't free trials of GOOD magazines, they are actually FREE subscriptions to magazines that you've never heard of...but they'll work for exactly this purpose ;)

    ^thanks a lot that's awesome! +1 i opened my po box and lied that i owned a small company called Ipod Tech. that website you gave me worked perfect because i can order computer/technical magazines and all packages coming to my po box will be addressed to "Ipod Tech" so i think the magazines i will be getting will blend in very nice!
