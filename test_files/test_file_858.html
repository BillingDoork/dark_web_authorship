    After having a dozen or so successful orders on the SR I'm having my first problematic order. I placed my order and the vendor shipped it about 12 days ago. After it didn't get here this weekend they tracked it and said it was delivered (on the 15th) in a city 50 miles away from the address I provided at time of order. Have you ever had this happen to you? I would understand if it was delivered in a neighboring town perhaps or the wrong P.O. Box but a town 50 miles away? Just wondering

    I've had this happen with Amazon packages.  In that case I just waited a few days and it sorted itself out to the right dispatch office.  Just give it a week and I bet it'll turn up!

    Find the person that has your drugs and shoot them.

    Or wait for it to get re-routed.

    Is there anything similar in the name of the city or the zip code to your own address?

    I'm assuming your in America and are talking about a package shipped via USPS...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have to remember that USPS is part of the government, so they're going to make many more than their fair share of mistakes.  I once saw a priority package (non SR stuff) from New York make a stop in Seattle before arriving at its destination in Florida.  So, things at USPS are weird.  I have never seen, however, a package actually marked 'delivered' to the wrong address.  A few things come to mind...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.  Try to get the actual tracking number from the vendor.  I don't know how reputable this vendor is and how much you ordered, but it could be a scam if you don't even have a DCN to look at.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2.  Don't actively try to get the package, that removes all your plausible deniability.  The accidental recipient of the package may have opened it and reported it to USPS or law enforcement, and if you're calling post offices up looking for it you're fucked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3.  Ask the vendor if he still has the address he sent it to.  Double-check it.  Also, if he does still have your address, I would never order from him again.  Lose-lose question and answer. :D
