    Howdy,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well I am a new-comer to these parts and was just about to make my first purchase.  I am supposed to put my name and address where to send the package.  Two questions.... Do I just write it down or do I put my address in a privnote first?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second question:  There is a space for a PIN number.  What is that for and what should I do with it or put in there.  I read the buyers rules but could not find this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help would be great... :D

    Stop.. read alot more before purchasing,  You should of had a PIN to make purchases with. if you do not remember it it will have to be reset and takes min 3 days  . the security sub forums has much of the information you seek. Private note is not a good encryption method, You need to do more research before ordering. We all want to rush but it is your safety and security you are dealing with. If you do not remember your pin there is a sticky in the tech support section. Learn PGP for you own protection,

    I agree and think OP should not be making any purchases at this time. READ and research the forums, there are simple techniques to protect yourself, but if you don't even know what the PIN is, you really better slow down. This is not like purchasing from Amazon.

    Besides, you should look into PGP encryption. It's gonna be your best friend here.

    Hi stiffneck,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've read your other posts, and I'm sorry to say it certainly doesn't look like you're ready to order anything from SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reasons why I say this:
    <br/>
    a) You may not even be on the right site (you gave a seperate URL)
    <br/>
    b) You appear to be unaware of PGP
    <br/>
    c) You don't know your PIN
    <br/>
    d) From the most cursory of investigation, I'm pretty sure I know your first name (you signed a post with an abbreviated version of it)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In a nutshell, you have a long way to go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hate to say this, but you are also acting in a way suspicious of LEO; posting unrelated URLs, encouraging the use of PrivNote (a suspected honeypot) and your terminology is odd.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before you're ready to purchase, you should:
    <br/>
    1. Understand the basic workings of TOR and it's limitations for privacy
    <br/>
    2. Understand how to get bitcoins into your account anonymously
    <br/>
    3. Have a SR account (where you know the PIN...)
    <br/>
    4. Be able to use (and USE) PGP to encrypt your address and other messages
    <br/>
    5. Have a safe delivery method/plan in place
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Educate yourself on these things, and best of luck.
