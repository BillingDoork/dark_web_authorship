    i have even seen this HUGE women walk into a post office with literally a grocery bag FULL of letters she just handed the bag over the counter, the lady asked if she wanted her plastic bag back lol an she said no and just walked out. she was on camera and probably was just sending some ebay or something like that but who knows. you could always pay someone or work something out with them where they are taking packages to the box 2 times a week all they have to do is meet you somewhere and pick up the packages. you arent sending so your okay and hes not packaging, maybe he has 1 or 2 fingerprints on the outside but that dosent matter its not inside that package. think of how many people touch the outside of the package once the seller puts it in the box.

    Go out at night time you twat!, buy a decent pair of leather gloves and just put them on right before you do the drop. At worst you can map out your drop points, park somewhere, drop a bike, wipe the handle down with ISO then BLEACH then ISO, grip with your gloves n ride it out. Always test run, note cams and such.

    Slow clap for this dumb fucking fuck.
    <br/>
    You want to give out your city too?
    <br/>
    How about your home address while you're at it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stop vending you fucking retard, before you get yourself and your customers into trouble. Get the fucking fuck out of here with this dumb shit. If I was in Arizona I'd personally place your face against the hot gravel and mush it in slowly, very, very slowly. You fucking wrinkled dog turd, how FUCKING STUPID ARE YOU?!?!
