    No. Fake name and either a fake address, or more usually, that of a business near the mailbox it was dropped off at. Hopefully in another city than the vendor's.

    Some actually do. It depends on what place on the schedule list the products are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One vendor I know of, never had any trouble because of this. Actually, when the package ended up in the wrong place, they returned it to that vendor. Maybe they didn't know, didn't mind or didn't care.
    <br/>
    In the worst case the vendor could deny everything, right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using something fake is a lot better. Though then those companies might get into trouble, which is also not right.
    <br/>
    So fake and non-existing but real looking would be the best :p
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can also ship research drugs which aren't on any list yet. I wonder if it would really be such a bad idea to put a real return address on the package. If it's not on the list, it's not illegal...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sending out cocaine and heroine with a real name return address would be totally moronic  :-X
