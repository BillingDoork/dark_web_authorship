    I am ordered some stuff from him at 11th december, i already ask him for tracking number, he reads my message but still didnt answer to me.
    <br/>
    I am living some place very close to europe,some eastern country  and 7 days seems to much for that kind of distance, i dont want to blame anyone but i am not sure what is going on at these moment.i am not caring about money, but time is very important for me.
    <br/>
    yesterday i asked for tracking number again (3rd time) but still waiting reply from him.
    <br/>
    Actually i dont think to open a topic like that until i saw these message on his wall today
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is another customer who seems to had trouble with him...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    -------------------
    <br/>
    Be carefull!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did the mistake and Finalize Early. The Order never arrived and since 2 weeks CrystalMethCat didn't answer my PN/mails.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    $83 for nothing! For now he seems to be a SCAMMER!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i still hope CrystalMethCat answers to my mails and we find a solution.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did good deals on SR with nice communication. I know, its possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ------------------------
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So comments are yours

    If you didn't Finalize Early and your coins are still in Escrow, you'll be fine. If you did FE, than you have no one to blame but yourself. Did you pay to have your package posted with Tracking? This is usually an additional cost if selected by the buyer when placing an order.

    I didnt finalize anything yet, i didnt remember with tracking number or not but i remember i choosed expensive one, i tried to check which one is expensive but , right now it is all free
    <br/>
    so there is no posting options at the moment because of chrtistmas.
    <br/>
    Like i said i am not trying to blaming anyone just trying to figure out what is going on .

    Since you haven't FE, once your order has been "in transit" for 10 days since being shipped and you still haven't received your order, go to the Resolution Center and submit a resolution you feel is fair to both of you. Your choices are a full or partial refund or extending the original due date out in case there has been a delay with shipping. Due to Xmas, this could be what has happened to your order. I'd suggest extending your due date out by 5 days and hopefully CMC will accept your proposal. Hope it all works out for you.  :)

    click-bang, you should be able to see what shipping option you chose by clicking ACCOUNT, then click ACCOUNT HISTORY, then click on the order in question which in turn will display some STATS from your order, including which shipping option you selected.

    Um... okay, that's new... I'm quite certain that it used to show the actual postage option chosen.  Apparently this recent lame attack on SR prompted them to change something that no longer supports that.

    Well that's kind of a bitch at a time like this... isn't it.

    It's a given that your package isn't being tracked or has a tracking number. Being from Germany, it would have been sent by Priority Mail. Once you open a dispute in the Resolution Center, you are able to ask for what ever you feel is a fair refund, from 1% up to 100% of the purchase price. Be aware that if the vendor doesn't accept your proposed resolution, then they will then put forward to you what they believe is a fair offer, for your consideration. If both parties are not able to reach an agreement, SR Support will step in, ask both parties to submit any evidence they have before making their final decision.  :)

    If we are talking about truths honestly I even dont  know was he send my package or not really,   i am already waiting for an answer from him almost 9 days , i check his login status everyday and he is logged in almost every day to the market, also he reads my messages too but still didnt answer
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So i am asking , if you guys were in my position what will you think against for that kind of  level unresponsiveness ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Resolve option will be unlock today, if i can get any communication option with him i will ask about package and talk about it, if we can deal i can wait couple days more ,  otherwise i will want my money back. i also already wait to much for that kind of distance...
    <br/>
    And i think i will never order without tracking option again.

    5gr of his bio weed. And yes, first time customer. What a coincidence with his "no refund for first timers" policy...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It`s pretty obvious that this guy is a selective scammer. Im sure he has not send anything in my direction. The chance of not getting a domestic order in germany are really fucking slim. I did this before SR with a guy i knew for 3 years. Not ONE order between us didn`t arrive, and our methods were pretty crude. No envelope gets checked here. He also doesn`t answer e mails and we are not the only ones who did not get anything from him. I saw his ratings and some people even gave him 5/5 despite the fact that the order did not arrive...great.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, tomorrow my patience is over and i go a step further. And i dont give a damn if he states somewhere that he doesn`t give refunds, that has no weight. My money is still in escrow and I want something back! Weed or BTS.

    i am also think about selective scamming like you because
    <br/>
    between two dates , no answers to my messages,no tracking number, no refund nothing...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But now i get my package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So your package can be come or coudnt too, but it seems christmass seems to effects to the delivery time at this time.
    <br/>
    Keep posting about updates.

    Sorry for the gravedigging, but it's better to keep it all to a single thread IMO
    <br/>

    I ordered some meth from this guy 2 weeks ago. Had to FE (which i did with other vendors and never had a problem)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No product, no reply to my messages. The only thing we can do is to report him i guess which i will have to do if the stuff does not show up this week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT: orders from other vendors did not show up either (full story here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163000.0 ), so maybe i wasn't scammed. Still no reply from him though  &gt;:(

    Pal, what kind of postage option you have ordered with?
    <br/>
    if its priority mail you will wait alot, 2-3 weeks do not get stress, MethCat's stealth packaging is good, but can not say same thing about delivery time and responsing of questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My suggest to everyone never ever order with priority mail if you do not want to wait over 8 days on international.

    I live in the same country. It should take 1 day, regardless of shipping method. Nothing ever arrived. And i know i put the correct address in. There is a reason if someone demands FE. Because they do not want to take responsibility or because they are scammers. CrystalMethCat is a scammer.

    <br/>
