    Does the risk of being busted increase with the weight of the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i.e. is 5g of powder more likely to be seized than 1g?

    US Customs knows that the more a package weights the more possible contraband that package could contain and as such it is safe to say that once a package crosses whatever weight threshold that customs set the more likely it is to be searched.

    I wouldn't call it relative but there's (probably) some correlation between the weight of the product and seizure rate yes

    In terms of relative suspicion do you think there is much difference between a package that weighs in at 1g vs 5g?

    I highly doubt they would scrutinize the weight difference of 1 or 5grams. Obviously, the more weight of drugs you start adding, the harder it will be to hide and also, if they do happen to catch it, there might be enough weight to investigate where the package is going.

    the weights that start raising eyebrows are 500g + and lb/kg

    the difference between 1 and 5g is not even noticeable.

    That's a huge gap - 5g to 500g. If that's the case and if vendors are as stealthy and smart as some say the are then the likely-hood of getting caught with anything as long as it's under those weights must come down to being pretty fucking unlucky yes?

    The biggest things in my book has always been the external appearance of the package and the paperwork being legit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dont have messy taped edges, excessive tape, handwritten labels, vague customs descriptions, stupid cute return addys etc
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Business and people ship millions of pieces of product a day. Light, heavy, big small. The job of a vendor is to make their pieces blend in with all the others.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also remember your weight is calculated including the packaging. So 1-50g isnt much difference when ya add in vac seal, envelopes, paper etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Simply change the size of your packaging to something that suits the weight increase and you will be fine. Dont try and stick 100g into a window envelope, put it flat inside a 9.5x11 business envelope. Dont try to put 500g into a large envelope, put it in a small box. 99.9% of the mail is legit, just make yours look like that and you can ship anything,

    Thanks for your reply FF, it makes sense what you say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I spose the anxiety small time buyers have is the associated risk with anything over say 10g as that is most likely seen as intent to distribute and not just for personal use.

    they search for parcels in this range
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4.5g,8.5g,15g,30g,58g114g,233g and so on
    <br/>
    the reason the weights aren't like 3.5g,7g,14g is because of envelope weight and stamps this adds weight so they subtract the weight and search more for these off weights
