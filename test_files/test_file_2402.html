    Ok guys I know questions like this have been asked before and I have searched this section for a situation similar to mine, but havnt been able to find an exact answer.  I would appreciate any feedback you guys can give me on this subject.  So I searched around and found a good sellar with many transactions under his belt and found one I liked to order  3 suboxone strips from.  I live in the US and ordered from a US vendor so I wouldnt run into any customs issues.  Anyway I got home from work today and noticed i recieved a note from the USPS , the normal " sorry we missed you" note everyone gets. The confusing thing is, there is no check mark under the box for "signature confirmation", but it says i had a letter sent thru "certified mail".  On the back of the card though there is a "delivery section" and it has a spot for my printed name and signature, and there are 2 Xs marked in those sections (i guess meaning thats where my mail lady was suppose to get my signature.
    <br/>
    I quickly emailed my vendor and asked if he requires signatures on packages and he replied "no i never require signatures on my packages, It may be a set up".  Now this scares the shit outa me.
    <br/>
    Is there certain areas in the US that require signatures even thou the seller didnt request for one??  Also I was thinking because it says "certified mail" , does that always require a signature too??
    <br/>
    I seen my normal mail lady right before i left work today, so i know it wasnt a controled delivery.  Should I request for a re delivery? I got a feeling i have to sign even when they come back.
    <br/>
    I did spell my name slightly different on the address section when i ordered ( only 1 letter different).   I dont know what to do.....

    What was the point of changing your name one letter different? It's quite obvious its you but it can definitely make them more suspicious to illegal activity. I don't want to make you sweat even more, but I don't want to get you into legal trouble either. I would wait until somebody gives you a definitive answer before doing anything. It could very well they asked for signature because the name was mispelled and they didn't look at the contents, or they could have looked at the contents and are attempting you to willingly take the package.

    No sweating required. Certified mail requires a sig. Maybe he didn't realize it was sent certified. Read this info regarding certified mail:
    <br/>
    http://faq.usps.com/eCustomer/iq/usps/request.do?create=kb:USPSFAQ&amp;view%28%29=c[c_usps6407]&amp;varset%28source%29=sourceType:embedded
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now if he's sure he didn't send it certified, maybe.....no way, it's 3 friggin subo strips. I mean come on. I would bet money you're good, man. Also, if you're really that worried about it, just don't sign for it. A simple " sorry I'm not expecting any deliveries, must be a mistake" will be fine.

    I mispelled my last name by 1 letter only because ive seen stuff sent to my house that had my last name mispelled.  I knew my mailman would deliver it, also i figured in a case something went wrong i thought i could easily deny it too saying its not me..   I did message my vendor asking if he sent it certified mail on accident so im waiting for his response.  I did not know "certified mail" always needs a signature so that makes me feel a little better

    It's 3 sub strips man. You're overreacting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One can not possibly tell that their is an illegal strip substance in there unless they put a radar to the parcel and read SUBOXONE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It doesn't smell, it's flatter than paper.. do I need keep going? ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You're fine. The vendor most likely made a mistake.
    <br/>
    I know standard protocol is never to sign for a package but in this case of 3 sub strips I firmly believe you have absolutely nothing to worry about.

    Cut your losses. This may not be a controlled delivery but at the least is a colossal failure on the sellers fault and considering the small amount of money involved just let them keep it. What kind of seller would send anything using certified mail? Certified mail always requires a signature and it doesnt accomplish anything that a tracking number wouldnt do. Certified mail often even requires ID, its for things like proprietary information that can only be put in the hands of the intended recipient. If your seller is saying they never require a signature that means they never send using certified mail and this is the first time they used the service. You should ask the vendor if they did in fact mail it using certified mail.

    Maybe its a legit mail from someone else.  Usually they put a description of the sender on that slip so you can get an idea of who it was from.

    no  mine wouldn't have any smell to it, it is a liquid. I worry the the glass could have broke though. Maybe express is just bogged down if both of us didn't receive hopefully USPS is just backed up.  I made a thread because i have only used express maybe 3 times and don't know what to expect time frame wise. I just know it can be overnight in some cases.

    It is weird.  I never heard of any vendor using certified mail since certified mail always requires signature in person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's only 3 suboxone strips though.  If they did find it, they would have probably just seized it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they actually wanted to give you a controlled delivery, they would have done so already.  But, not over fuckin 3 strips of suboxone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm pretty certain you can walk into the USPS and retrieve the package fine though.  This kind of thread pops up almost weekly, and people come back fine after picking up their shit from the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please update us on the situation after you get the package.

    yeah i wouldnt worry about picking something up at the post office. if they were going to get you i would think they would want to do it at your home. i really doubt they would have some cops waiting around all day just to see if you come and pick them up either. I bet you are fine and the vendor accidentally sent it certified.

    hey guys so my vendor finally got back to me, he said he did not send it certified mail.  Who the fuck knows, maybe he did but forgot, maybe the mailman in my area has different rules where they need signatures for anything like that , idk???
    <br/>
    Anyway i did notice on the back of that card there was a small section saying i could get it redelivered.  BUT i needed to sign the card and put it back in the mailbox with a day i would like it redelivered.  So after much thinking about it i fuckin signed it and put it back in my mailbox stating they could redeliver it . There was a section i filled out where they wanted to know where the mailman could put the letter when he comes back.  I just said put it in the screen door.  So by me signing the card i guess thats good enough for them to redeliver without me being there.  Ill update you guys on Mon when my letter gets here (GOD I FUCKIN HOPE SO). its crazy for me to stress about this i know, but man i got a good job and too much to loose for this if something goes wrong. lol

    If they were going to do a controlled delivery, it would have happened already, particularly over the small amount of your order. You have nothing to worry about. If it's really that big of a deal, considering your job and all, then just don't accept the package. Go back and re-order and have it sent priority, or go with another vendor who won't slip up and make you paranoid. Don't ever get yourself into a situation if you don't already have a plan in place to deal with it.

    first,i would like to thank ECLIPSIN for his opinion on,and advice,to NOXPLODE,i think re-delivery is the way to go,and if usps deviates from normal delivery routine(ie:seconnd notice,p.o. pick-up,even taking the package directly from a carrier) I would leave it alone,as in deny it's yours.i would sniff around and try and see his mailing practice

    You'll be fine bro.  Usually on registered (or certified) they need you present to sign.  So if that box was checked maybe it isn't.  Either way, just fill that out and have it where he can find it when he redelivers.  No Mail on Monday though.....damn Columbus Day.
