    Okay. Standard everyday-use cell phones used to communicate. I live Ohio-ish. My friend is from Cali. He's a bit dumb and uses vacuum sealed foodsaver bags wrapped in clothes with some candy on top and calls it a package. (1lb of bud in the package) Friend calls me up somewhat sketched out on a Saturday afternoon that FedEx put his box aside rather than on the belt as he normally watches packages go off. Friend uses his friend's real return address, and my friend's shipping address with a bastardizing of MY name (fucking retard.) Oops. Not the simplest taping job, but not the most over the top either. New box. He payed for overnight. Didn't show up yesterday (Monday). Didn't show up today. Didn't get a tracking number due to not knowing shit about how to safely browse the internet, yet knowing not to check on it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have the feeling it may still be in California and that he's going to get fucked... But what about me?

    I would say if you never received the package your friend may be in for a visit from his friendly neighborhood police officer. Or maybe FedEx just fucked up, no way of really knowing until it all goes down. Hope everything works out for you, and maybe give your friend some tips on safe shipping practices  ;)

    You made a rookie mistake by using anything other than USPS for shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I's good to use a burner phone for calls, but I'd prefer to use PGP and a 15 + character password to communicate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You want to package to look as professional and business-like as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never more than 2 strips of tape on an an opening/seam.  The contents themselves should use triple layer sealing. (See the STICKY for shipping details)   The box/carton should  not be to 'mask' the package..

    This is UPS, but I'm sure FedEx is similar.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's what happens when your UPS package smells like weed:
    <br/>
    Somebody notices, and they:
    <br/>
    1.) Notify the authorities (sucks)
    <br/>
    2.) Intentionally damage the label to render it illegible. This covers their ass since now they have a "reason" to open your package (you're supposed to have another shipping label or invoice inside), and they steal your weed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've heard of option #2 happening a lot more than #1, but the UPS guys I know aren't the authoritarian type.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is one of the few times I'd be hoping my weed was stolen.
