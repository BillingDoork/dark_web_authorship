    Sorry if this is covered already in an existing thread, but I desperately want to know who the safest vendor for getting meth into aus from overseas is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had international orders arrive where while the letter itself looked normal, upon opening the letter it would be very easy to find the things I don't want found. Who can get a gram in and actually stealth the gear? So you can open it, look through, and not find drugs. I've already got letters that haven't arrived so I really don't want to have the stuff found.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Drugs vac sealed and folded into paper isn't stealth any customs person that opens it could find it easily.

    Mate, having 1 gram sent over in a letter is hardly going to attract a look from Customs if packaged correctly. Letters have a sniffer dog run over them but are not x-rayed. Only parcels and packages are x-rayed. Choose a vendor who is professional in their packaging such as MIMM, Pooh Bear (could be out at the moment)and DubG who are 3 I've used. There are many more, just look on his latest feedback and search the forum for info.

    No one has claimed it can be? All I said is envelopes (letters) aren't x-rayed (unless they have been selected for further investigation) but do have sniffer dogs run over them. There is no doubt about there being ways to import larger quantities, but that sort of info should not be discussed on a public forum. That would be something you learn from other people's past experiences, research on methods/techniques and some trial and error.

    I've been researching this myself recently, and x-ray cannot be beaten; it sees fucking everything. But as Waz said they don't scan everything, and the shit they do scan certainly isn't examined thoroughly; it would be simply a cursory glance which is enough to pick up the most obvious shit. Unless the package raises a few flags then they'd x-ray it more thoroughly. All you can do is package it appropriately to contain the smell, so it isn't obvious on x-ray and so it doesn't raise any flags (being sent from Columbia for example); after that it's a numbers game.

    The goal isn't to make something hard to find when a package is opened.  The goal is to get something through customs.  Keeping a package thin and lightweight will probably help to ensure that customs doesn't open the package in the first place.

    I am pretty sure mail does get x-rayed as well - not sure what percentage though. I have seen them doing it on the Border Security show.

    If they were to x-ray each "letter" sent through International Post, the mail would face some huge delays. I have a friend who's husband works in this field of work. Think about the time it would take to x-ray each or even most of the letters they receive daily? Just not practical. Similar to the ports, only approx 4% of the containers arriving in Aust. are inspected and searched, based on profiling such as country of origin etc. It's not possible to inspect everything coming through Customs with the x-ray machine. Suspicious mail will be x-rayed, the rest of it won't be.

    Inside stealth should still be used, just make sure your package matches the x-ray image, for instance  an x-ray image of hash is the same as an x-ray image of chocolate.
