    Someone told me that x-ray machines have a switch that can differentiate between 'organic' and 'non organic'. Does anyone have ideas about this? If say I hid weed inside something plastic, would it instantly show up on the x-ray screen? If anyone has any pointers at all about x-ray capabilities I'd be interested to hear. Thanks

    Yes they do. They can differentiate between organic/non-organic and metals.

    At the risk of making a fool of myself and asking silly question, all powdered drugs show up as organic?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could you possibly use another organic material that will go through customs to hide drug organic material?

    I think they also look at different densities, so you can't just suspend a baggy in a jar of peanut butter for instance.

    this guy is right, it's how they can X-ray your skin and see your bones, or when you see a hospital X-ray of someone's been stabbed you can clearly see where the knife is. There's little you can do to prevent x-rays, there are ways around it but they're very time consuming.

    It wouldn't because the matter isn't of the same density so it would show up as an irregularity. The method is actually much simpler than this but I'm not discussing it on an open forum.

    I was more of leaning on mixing it into the cake, of course that's kinda difficult when it's got to be baked, that said it was tongue in cheek anyway.

    Haha my bad, I didn't sense the tone. Not been sleep so bit slow.

    Just to be a complete geek the mixing it in thing couldn't be viable because the dogs would still smell it unless it was cooked and cooking would destroy the product.
