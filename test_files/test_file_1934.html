    Hey guys Im in a bit of a situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was supposed to receive a bulk package of MDMA yesterday sent via Registered Mail (USPS). However, I missed my delivery and the mail man left me a note on my door telling me to go into the post office to pick up my package. There are couple reasons why I feel somewhat sketched out about this....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One, If the package was too big to fit in the mailbox then why didn't the mailman put it in a parcel box (I live in an apartment complex). This is usually what happens to me when the package is too big.
    <br/>
    Two, Why didn't the mailman leave it at the leasing office / at my door?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the USPS website it states that a signature is NOT required to receive the package for Registered Mail for international shipping, which is the case here.
    <br/>
    I was left a pink note at my door with Registered Mail and The size of the package (Parcel - The word SMALL was written) checked and nothing else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, my seller stated that the goods would be sent in a package no larger than a DVD case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am offered the option of redelivery - Which I actually scheduled for tomorrow via the USPS redelivery website. I stated in the additional comments of the redelivery form that the package be left at my door, at the leasing office, or in the parcel box. Do you guys think this was the right way to approach this situation?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do not feel comfortable going into the post office to pick up a bulk package of MDMA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone have experience with a situation like this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    Why not?  You don't know what is in the parcel, you just got a notice.

    I'm guessing because they would require a form of ID and signature. I understand where you are coming from. But I feel as though it is too risky this way. I will use this as a last resort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think scheduling a redelivery and leaving a note stating to leave the package at the door/leasing office is satisfactory?

    Registered, Insured, and Certified always requires a signature. You can also mark on the note: Re-Deliver then you won't have to go to the post office.

    False.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Package arrived using redelivery scheduled online with USPS. Mailman knocked on the door, handed me the package, and left. Registered mail requires a signature ONLY if it's Domestic. This was international.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the input and advice though :)
