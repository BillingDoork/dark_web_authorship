    Anyone ever have a successful delivery from the Netherlands? This is quite possible the worst country to order from, but that's where the majority of LSD comes from unfortunately. It seems like all domestic vendors either charge up the ass or have half their packages go missing.

    Have you looked into Tesselated? I believe they ship out of Canada and seems to be a very solid vendor.

    I've also read good reviews for Tesselated (product itself and shipping).Â  They do only do 10 tab orders for a minimum, but I will be placing an order with them in the next few weeks for sure based on what I've read.

    The problem with Tesselated for me is that, as mentioned, I'd have to buy 10 of them for over $10 a tab. I don't have $125 to blow on me and one other friend. There are even star vendors from the Netherlands that sell for less than $10 a tab, close to $5 on some, and I can get 3 or 5 of them.
