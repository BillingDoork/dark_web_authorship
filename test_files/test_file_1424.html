    Hi everyone
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Scary story. I've just come back from the post office after sending an oz to a customer. I handed the envelope over to the post worker and as soon as it was on more of her side than mine, she asked me "Our new policy is to ask the contents... What's in here?". Luckily I play a lot of poker and am pretty good at keeping calm and collected. I replied it was an old VHS cassette. She seemed happy with my quick response. Especially as she then traced the corners of the package with her fingers, drawing a shape of a VHS cassette box. I stood there as she printed off the first class stamp, affixed it to the parcel, printed me off a receipt with proof of sending. I thought, if I run out now, they'll be straight in that package. But if I stand here, like a normal person would do, and wait for my proof of sending, then that'd be perceived as the actions of an innocent person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, I don't know if it was the Bob Marley T-shirt I was wearing, or the fact I've not shaved in weeks, or whether the post office really does have to ask the contents of all the parcels coming through its doors? Either way, be extra vigilant fellow vendors!

    Hijacking threads will not get you your account back. I don't know anything about your story but I can see by your actions now that you're a right prick so could you kindly fuck off this thread. Appreciate it.

    Woah you are brave, going into the post office to post? I can't bring myself to do anything that could even POTENTIALLY link me with any of my packages. Canadian postal service has always asked what is in the package whenever shipping international (I sell things on eBay all the time, and of course go into the post office for this).

    Unless you mean this was domestic which would be quite weird. Who the heck has VHS players anymore =P.

    It was domestic. Very strange indeed I thought. Haha, I know, maybe next time (at another post office coz I'm never going back there again!), I'll say its a Nintendo DS or something. I was having visions of her opening it up in front of me to verify the truth though :/

     This is normal policy, it came in force today, they ask for international shipping almost every time. If you want a better way to do things and you're in the UK shoot me a message as regular going the post office is a game you shouldn't bother with because the costs are higher and you have to wait in queues.

    Very very true. By costs I assume you mean financial as well as security! Maybe I am just being paranoid though.

    Hey CannaKing, I know it's vague, but is even that general description of yourself smart?

    Hopefully you were actually in a suit and clean shaven.
