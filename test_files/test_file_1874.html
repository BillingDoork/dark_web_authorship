    Has anyone here recieved a letter from the police or been contacted by the police. I stress absolute balls while waiting for an order to arrive. What I want to know is how many of these packages being sent by SR to Australia are being stopped at the border. Surely if customs find any illegal drugs they have to pass it on the the cops and I'd assume they would follow up on most of them. Fuck getting caught, is it really worth the risk? How many packages get through OZ customs? Please leave speculation at the door, anyone here got facts, stats, percentages etc?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I dont seem to see any feedback on purchases mentioning getting busted. Thoughts?

    Is Australia really hard to get packages through customs? I keep seeing posts about this sort of thing with Australia. I wonder if it's on par with Netherlands customs and shipping product out of the country there.

    the reason they go for arrests is due to their low number of intercepts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Worrying about getting arrested by using silk road is like worrying about getting eaten by a shark whilst surfing. Absolute waste of energy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still, after SR has been flooded by kooks now, it is a lot riskier as I am sure they (AFP/customs) have profiled the lazy vendors packages, as they never change.

    Yes, the Olympics are about to start, This will affect shipping processing times worldwide.

    Yes, people get a love letter, it can happen. Be smart, read the forums for tips on how to stay secure.

    Buying illegal drugs is illegal  ;) Taking illegal drugs is illegal. Ordering illegal drugs online, shipping them internationally and receiving those illegal drugs is reeeeeeeeeeeally illegal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're worried, say no to drugs. Or hi to your local dealer (but a head's up, that's illegal too).

    Fuck local dealers. They're almost always wannabe gang-bangers or put on a tough facade. Ordering online is so much safer. I don't have to deal with all that drama.

    To answer you questions there is a lot of information already on these forums about how many packages are getting through customs, so do some research there instead of asking more people to post information that can be used by LE. If the threat of customs picking up your package is a worry you can do two things, buy from someone with a proven record of good packaging to increase the odds of it coming through, or order domestically to avoid customs all together.

    The number one reason why cops catch people is stupidity. The second reason is under estimating them. The third is luck. Occasionally luck goes to number one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no idea what you do for living, but I'll assume even if you're no good at it, you'll know someone else in another industry who is good at their job. There are cops who are damn good at their job. There are customs guys who are damn good at their job and there are dogs who love to sniff the shit out of stuff. Then there's cops who get lucky, dog who get rostered on at the right (wrong) time and then there's people who for no reason whatsover given their intelligence or skills get cocky.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because of those things, they don't need to crap Tor. But for your own safety, don't think they don't have the measure on every vendor here and the methods of postage. The ONLY reason anyone on here is safe is in the sheer numbers of packages and letters. But technology the rest of us can't even imagine will make a big dent sooner rather than later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look at it this way, if sorting machines can sort millions of letters a day in a 1/1000th of a second, how hard can it be for them to be programed to noticed certain things other than an address in the same time?

    Wasn't it the US Navy who created/funded Tor? Obviously not so low-life degerates such as ourselves could conduct anonymous illegal business on here. But for citizens of oppressed countries, such as Iran, Syria et.al... We have simply used it for our 'nefarious' actions.. well fuck them!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then again it could all be a CIA plot to monitor every 'illegal' transaction that occurs.... but it's not like we are trading in Plutoninum or anything...

    I have made going on 50+ orders from SR and many years from overseas RC market and before this year my success rate was about 95%, this year since SR exploded its fallen to about 50%. Half of those i would even say i may have been selectively scammed by sellers (who love to rip off us aussies, always instantly blaming our awesome customs/border protection).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know for sure 5 packages this year had been picked up by customs, but I have never receieved a love letter or even given any info regarding what happened to my package. Usually it tracks from its departure point and then nothing else is visible through the customer tracking portal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    None of my packages have been exceptionally large purchases, probably the biggest is 10 grams MDMA. 5 grams got seized. I have never heard anything from the authorities about any of my illegal imports. Maybe they are building a case and keeping tabs on you over time? I really doubt this though. I really dont think they want to go after the small fish, too many of us, too much paper work and too little resources to police us all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am going to go out on a limb here and say they are so freakin busy that they dont really care for packages less than 10grams, or 50 pills. They just seize them and chuck in them in the stack of all the other menial recreational drug import attempts. They will take note of your address and name and put it in a database, but how they use that database to catch you future dodgey dealings I have no idea, as I have still received packages at address that i was sure had been flagged. Maybe the database cross reference checks vs. incoming mail only gets turned on at certain times/shifts, not sure what the policy is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All my tracked packages from EU to Aus that havent made it havent showed any more info on tracking than their initial departure point. When it hits our shores here in OZ the first peeps it hits is customs off the plane, if they seize it they dont even bother scanning it in at our end. So all it ever shows is the fact it left the source country, and nothing else. I can confirm this is true for Australia border crossings.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The courier companies (fedex/dhl etc.) have a diff deal whereby they do half the job of customs and you will often see it as 'arrived AUS port, awaiting customs clearance' but most of the time that is mainly to assess if proper import duties/tax have been paid or need to be paid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THe only benefit i see of tracking for SR purchases is to stamp out scammers. Tracking will at least show that your package was shipped, and for sellers it will confirm that buyer received it if/when they do (to avoid the classic buyer fishing for refund scam). Big note: watch out for well known selected scammer/ loophole some sellers use when using tracked shipments: 1) they get the tracking number scanned into the system without actually sending anything out, quite easy to do with vendor tools postal companies make avalaible 2) They give you a duplicate or empty package tracking number. Both of these loopholes can be found out by actually contacting the source country postal service who can confirm the actual address, and the validity of your tracking number/package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am still waiting for my first 'love letter', they are hardly ever issued these days, and my best guess is that police/customs only send them out when your package is seized during a 'check shift' or 'official customs operation'. I have never even gotten a smidgen of helpful info back from Aus post/tracking for any of my int'l packagea that have gone missing. The agreed policy between customs/ Aus post for seized contraband is to provide the least info to the customer possible. When i have rung the post office with my tracking number and asked for more information, 'appearntly' the Aus post rep 'can' actually see that my package has been seized, or that it had been 'taken out of the system manually'  but they are under strict guidelines not to pass this information on. Usually you will get a snide 'i have no idea where your package is sorry i cant help you' with no sympathetic tone at all.

       To answer you questions there is a lot of information already on these forums about how many packages are getting through customs, so do some research there instead of asking more people to post information that can be used by LE. If the threat of customs picking up your package is a worry you can do two things, buy from someone with a proven record of good packaging to increase the odds of it coming through, or order domestically to avoid customs all together.

    Do you think that you're invincible? Have you even read the Tor documentation? It lists exactly how you could get found out by using Tor, it's not foolproof, if you think PGP and Silk Road are infallible you are also ignorant. This attitude will get you caught. I don't even know why I'm bothering to tell you this because you're obviously so clever you're probably going through 10 proxies as well, but maybe it will help others.

    +2.....

    <br/>
    Like some.bloke I have noticed the massive decline in the success rate of importations mainly due to SR and the heat its brought onto drugs in the post. I had a success rate of 100% with a NL vendor for gods sakes.... i wonder if he was still around if that rate would still be the same. Anyway it appears that a lot of the success of customs is down to lazy and uncreative vendors. Some of these big vendors send the same post items all the time, all it takes is won intercept then their onto that method and the whole thing is bust. Most of the items just look plain dodgy/out of place, they would literally stick out like dogs balls to a customs officer. Also I bet most of these vendors are not packaging theirs items correctly, their would be trace elements all over the outside of the vacuum package and the letter itself, very easy for the dogs to sniff it out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From what i can gather only certain loads that are deemed high risk are accessed by customs, there is some literature around from an article in the Australia where this is discussed as well as the % they scan of different types of mail. anecdotally ive had evidence to support this.... that being the time it takes for an item to arrive, if its quick it hasn't been accessed, if its slow its been accessed and its made it thru ( that is of course discounting the vendor variable), The items that got here quick from x vendor were 100% were as the slow items were 50% hence checked vs un checked. Once the load of mail has been assigned to be accessed it appears they sort the mail into different sizes/types of envelopes, i guess they could then access the different types and then gain data on the types of mail used to smuggle drugs and hence target that group more. I haven't seen any mail being x rayed on the belt but i guess they could do that once a dog has high lighted it.  But yer i guess they just sort the load into category then check them with the dog and also visually inspect the mail to see if anything is standing out ( IE lazy vendors same postage methods).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think creative well packaged mail still can make it thru the gauntlet, anything other than perfect just isnt good enough nowadays im afraid tho.

     Wasn't it the US Military that invented the Internet as a whole? (I say that in the sense they invented the concept of course...) Pretty sure it wasn't meant so that I can get access to porn on my phone, but the strange places we find ourselves in 2012...

    He was no doubt caught not because of a failure of Tor (unless he failed to use Tor properly) and he was no doubt caught not because of SR or even bitcoin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm sure he was caught because customs caught the shipment and followed the trail from there. And that's the only real risk. Make it past the dogs/inspectors and you've made it. There in lies the gamble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The release is nothing more than a scare tactic/make mums and dads feel safer by making it sound like they've managed to crack SR/Tor. IMHO they'd be better off saying their detection techniques are so good and that's the reason. It'd be more believable.

    Maybe you should start a poll on if it's worthwhile starting a poll on asking if we need a poll in every thread? Or, you could just be looking for easy statistics for some report to show you boss, either way, fuck off with your poll requests.

    Exactly!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The most preferable option is secure your encrypted USB/Virtual Drive/Computer/Device from possible confiscation during raid/arrest.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, do not give any indication to your SR username etc... It is all commonsense information, but you need to think about these things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be proactive about your security arrangements and continually educate yourself in the matter, this is fundamental to your success as a buyer/seller.

    i'm a glutton for punishment - i study law part time, and i work full time to pay the bills (and buy weed).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    we did a unit on cybercrime last year, and this exact law came up. whilst opinions among my colleagues was divided - i spent that semester convinced that i was the best potential lawyer in that class - i reckon that piece of legislation falls over as soon as it's tested.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in a nutshell, it's to do with providing the court with evidence against yourself, which you can't be compelled to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    here's an excerpt about an American case:
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
     In a ruling that could have broad ramifications for law enforcement, a federal appeals court has ruled that a man under investigation for child pornography isn’t required to unlock his computer hard drives for the federal government, because that act would amount to the man offering testimony against himself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ruling Thursday appears to be the first by a federal appeals court to find that a person can’t be forced to turn over encyption codes or passwords in a criminal investigation, in light of the Fifth Amendment, which holds that no one “shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals of the 11th Circuit ruled that “the Fifth Amendment protects [the man's] refusal to decrypt and produce the contents of the media devices,” which the government believes contain child pornography.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ruling could handcuff federal investigators, as more data are secured behind sophisticated encryption software.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    now obviously an American precedent isn't binding in Australia (especially as the right to not incriminate oneself is set out in their bill of rights), but the Federal Court or High Court would consider it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in addition to this, if a cop or a judge was to ask you to reveal an encryption key, you would simply say that you don't know it - you lost it, it was automatically generated. the court obviously cannot compel you to provide something that you don't have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they would make you go through the process of resetting that key - and you would then go back to the argument about incriminating oneself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as i said, we don't have that explicit protection from incriminating ourselves in Australia, but one of the tenets of our legal system - the right to remain silent - is based on the premise that one might incriminate themself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so onto the question as to how this person got caught - i can only imagine he's ordered 500 pills and they've done a controlled delivery. for an ounce of pot, or for 5 pills, or for half a point of coke, i just don't think the fuzz gives a shit. it costs them too much time and effort to take a case to court when the likely outcome for such a small amount is a rebuke from the judge to the prosecutor for bringing such a bullshit case, rather than putting the alleged offender in a diversion program.
    <br/>

    <br/>
    i can't say that i've ordered from overseas since my first order, but that isn't to do with a fear of getting caught - it's just cos i hate throwing money away when shit doesn't arrive (I'd rather pay extra for domestic). but if i was to order from overseas, assuming it was only for personal use (which is all it would ever be), then *touch wood* i wouldn't be panicking that anyone is going to bother knocking on my door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and if they do? i'd never sign for anything, and "i didn't order any drugs officer."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but with all that said - i'd never buy from a vendor who wanted to track the mail. i don't think ordering small amounts for personal use is going to get you caught - but why introduce another risk by having it tracked?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    surely the risk of not receiving your mail is a more palatable risk than the fuzz on your doorstep.

     While encryption can be used freely within Australia, the Cybercrime Act 2001 includes provisions for law enforcement to compel the disclosure of encryption keys, passwords, and any other details necessary to obtain evidence in a protected or encrypted state.  Penalties up to and including imprisonment can be imposed if a person does not comply with such an order.  This reverses the situation prior to the introduction of the Act, whereby a user could refuse to provide encryption keys necessary to decrypt data if such an act would result in incriminating one’s self.

     Do you think that you're invincible? Have you even read the Tor documentation? It lists exactly how you could get found out by using Tor, it's not foolproof, if you think PGP and Silk Road are infallible you are also ignorant. This attitude will get you caught. I don't even know why I'm bothering to tell you this because you're obviously so clever you're probably going through 10 proxies as well, but maybe it will help others.

    If I was in Australia I would probably not be using SR.

    Officials there want to make examples out of people. Scare tactics work well at doing that, and nothing better to scare people then pursuing prosecution even on a small level.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't have any figures but their volume of international mail is probably a fraction of other countries. Same with New Zealand. Simply because they are rich isolated island nations with small populations. They have the tech and money to pursue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure Europe is full of small countries as well, but they have an open Market and very dense overall population with lots of international trade. What does Australia base it's international economy on? Natural resources, and not consumer products and international services like other countries.

    Re: fartknocker, I disagree. We (Aussies) import fucktons of shit from all over the world, due to our isolated location. eBay packages alone would have increased the workload of Customs and AFP. While the numbers may not match, say, the U.S., we do get (i think from memory) over a billion packages a year through our borders... no need to scare would-be or current Aussie SR users...

    Not trying to scare, just stating my opinion based on my personal theory of this system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A haven't run the numbers, but how does a billion imports a year compared with australia's population, then do the same with the USA. I bet the Australian's percentage is much higher. The numbers are going to be very small, but the differences between the two tiny numbers (percentage wise) tell the true story.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bet the US imports more packages than Australia by a factor of at least 10. Both have modern economies and a keen sense of controlled borders, given the location of Australia to SE Asia poverty and criminal networks, and the US to Mexico and south America and the problems they bring.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Both countries probably share tech and information, and their international sorting facilities probably are equally equipped tech wise. Now find the number of international sorting facilities in each country, and compare it to both population and to incoming parcels.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would reckon the US also beats Australia by a factor or 10 or more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's a fair playing field customs wise it's just a numbers game. Less packages going through less international sorting facilities equally equipped and trained. Now add the fact that your media is scaring the voting parents into thinking this is a real threat, and you get political pressure and resources diverted to catch incoming product, and then pursue receivers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australia is doing it right to focus on catching as many packages as they can and pursuing receivers simply because their circumstances allow for more screening. And intimidation is a proven method of control, or at least making someone think twice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would pay the premium to buy locally if I were an Australian. Just my opinion. Although for dealers the amazing price differences would be awfully temping. Probably would import via the post if dealing. Only very large amounts of powders to as secure a location as possible, using dealers who have experience shipping weight. That dealer pfandleiher got caught because he was new to the online game. He had access to supply, and the desire to make money and serve quality product as fast as he could within the SR rules, even for newbies with no FR. His intentions were noble, but he was bad at making even the simplest of packages. I've heard he was shipping grams in 50 gram envelopes internationally. With shit external stealth. I believe the Aussies that a majority of aussies didn't receive. Even those intent on scamming probably didnt get his packages :-) SR made the right choice putting his operation out of business via economics (refunds) rather than having him get busted and made an example of because he wasn't good with the shipping end.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not interested in doing the research to prove (or disprove) this theory, but if someone really wanted a stastical analysis made for the site I could be convinced to do the work for a bit of coke ;-) Half gram for top 3 countries, 2 grams for top 10 countries. 5 for all 27 EU countries. 10 for the "First world countries" as designated by the WTO or whoever publishes the yearly stats. Graphs, sources, and all

    Fair call. My 'billion packages a year' is actually from an article I saw about Australia Post. Just because the US has a way bigger population than us, doesn't mean we aren't up there in the top 10/20 lists re: imports from overseas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Comparing population numbers to import numbers is not a viable way to calculate these sorts of things. Example: India has over a billion people, and I bet that the U.S has more imports per year than them. You have to look at socio-economic factors too, like how so many people in India are way below the poverty line.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Australia has a robust economy, albeit with shitty retail stores (IRL) that markup goods anywhere from 150% to 500%. THIS IS FACT (look at Harvey Norman). Now they're complaining that online shopping is killing them... No shit. We have some of the highest land values in the world, hence retail store rents are through the roof, not to mention our massive minimum wage compared to, say, the US. That shit costs money, and businesses have to pay for it somehow... by marking up everything they sell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look at the recent retail crisis in Australia.. cunts want to charge $4k for a TV I can have imported for $850. No fucking thanks. And they wonder why they aren't selling TV's anymore?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is the reason that we have such large number of imports, that and the fact that we are an isolated country with no land bridges to anywhere doesn't help either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to do the numbers, by all means, do it, and start a BTC donation fund and i'll happily donate to it! :)

    What do you guys think of this situation:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I received a package from an international source a couple weeks back, it was labelled with a sticker saying 'inspected by customs' and the package had clearly been opened then taped back up. Inside was a printed slip saying 'this package was opened by Australian customs, nothing of concern was found'. The product I ordered was all there (an RC in powder form) in a plastic packet. There was no labeling anywhere to indicate what the powder was.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am blown away that customs opened it, checked it out, then sent it on!!! Why was this not confiscated? Or 'disappeared'??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All I can think of is that they couldn't identify it and so gave it the benefit of the doubt, like 'oh well, maybe its a legit dietary supplement or something.'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was a 'controlled delivery' To catch the recipient accepting the goods, the package surely wouldn't have been labelled 'Opened by customs' right? And as I said, this happened a couple weeks back and Ive had no contact from LE....
    <br/>

    Customs don't have the resources to send every package containing a powdery substances to a lab to be scientifically analysed for molecular composition. Legitimate scientific chemicals come in by the hundreds every day, if they look suspicious they will be analysed testing for the common imported drugs; mdma, coke, h, amps and steroids. If they clear that they are usually sent on their way, or just held for you to claim and tell them what it is. If they have any more means for suspicion; dodgy name or address/ fake return address, or it is a large quantity, only then will it be sent to a lab for a case to be made against the recipient.

    I was going to start a new thread but as this seems to be a popular one on the front page I'll jam this here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Australian Government has invested in an data mining and intelligence analysis system created by a company called Palantir. I'm unsure of the department that funds this system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The system is being used to do big data analysis and profiling of government data such as flights (customs), ATO (tax), telecoms (whatever they can force the telcos to send such as data and sms).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A known recent addition to the Palantir feed is Australia Post information, which has been added in the last few months. What information is being collected and how it is being analysed or used I'm not sure. My understanding of it is that at the least OCR type analysis of the source and destination addresses of packages, the same way they would do this for sorting, distribution and delivery of mail. The obvious use is for proactively identifying security risks such as terrorism. I have absolutely no doubt this would be used in the future to profile for SR type activity as it is a pretty simple extension of the use of this system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For those of you that are receiving or sending deliveries, I would suggest using mechanisms that would not trip simple rules based analysis of your addresses. Random source addresses or random delivery names which would match a 'many to 1 physical destination'  would be the most obvious way I could imagine them matching for SR type packages. I also have doubts this would be realistic for domestic mail due to the sheer volumes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TL;DR - Auspost is being monitored. Assume your mail to/from at least is going into a database is being collected. Doubt it means much to most but you should be aware of it and keep smart.

    So you've got a mate working at Aus Post? Or for Palantir?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They're hiring, maybe one of us should go be a double agent :)

    But yeah it does seem to be the weak link in the chain... TOR is strong enough, bitcoin is just too much data. They are too many packages sent to scan them all, a little powder in an airmail letter would be hard to recognise... but logging names at addresses wouldn't be much extra effort considering it goes through the OCR system anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So you recommend always using the same name? Anything else?

     I'm a little unsure, are you suggesting this could\would be used to pick up things like mail going to houses where there is no resident by that name? Or that it would give them the ability to pull letters sent to flagged addresses or something?

    I think the idea is that if a certain address or PO box has been getting mail to one or two names for years, and then suddenly starts getting a lot of international mail to a range of different names, that's a quick way to flag an address for closer inspection.

    Are you guys kidding? I seriously get over 5 letters a week from people who no longer live in my rented sharehouse. These letters range from superannuation for previous housemates, group certificates from employees at tax time, letters from the greek consulate for somebody whom i'm guessing is now dead and was the original owner of this house...

    These are just a few examples. I pass on some of these letters to ex housemates i still know. But the vast majority go straight in the bin.

    "Keep your house clean" is a pretty fucking basic tenet to hold to when ordering contraband online.

    Ordering an International package of drugs to a house installed with a illegal hydroponic setup must be one of the most ridiculously stupid things a SR buyer could EVER do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Without going into too much details, if you are going to order from overseas use a secure drop that you can setup reasonably easy. We have extensive experience in this area and for obvious reasons we will not be releasing the information on a public forum.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We may be offering Matrix™ consultation services in the near future as there is a clearly a need for some of the newbies on here, the amount of risk people are taking ordering from overseas in staggering.

    Received a love letter from the police some time ago, basically had said mail had been intercepted and if it was mine I had 30 days to claim it. The quantity was small but would be considered more than just possession. Will not be providing any evidence of this to protect myself. Just putting it out there that they do send out letters.

     There are plenty of different methods, and this is just one option:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) Search realestate websites (eg. realestate.com.au), type your postcode and/or surrounding suburbs
     <br/>
     2) Search for office space and write down all the addresses
     <br/>
     3) Googlemap said addresses (or do a 'drive by') and look out for those large communal letterboxes (Sometimes they're a stand alone brick letterbox located out the front) - similar to letterboxes used in apartments
     <br/>
     4) Order to that vacant office
     <br/>
     5) put your own padlock on the box
     <br/>
     6) pick up your drugs
     <br/>
     <br/>
     @Matrix™  If you share your information with the community -minus the location information, then what is the problem?

    Some good tips there, our system is a little more sophisticated and we think the less people post about this kind of information in public the better. We are talking bulk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is some holes in your plan there, especially with the incidences of surveillance and controlled deliveries which we have strategies for.

    Not sure where you're from, but postboxes have a slot at the front, and a lid at the back (which is where you place a lock). No the postman has no idea if the office @ 3/20 office st is vacant, because he is a postman. And i know this because he delivers letters there. I made test runs before i ordered. I "actually" got what i ordered.  Why would you think the postman has even the slightest idea of whether an office in a complex is vacant or not?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which country is yours that has the back to front postboxes. In Australia post is delivered to WHEREVER and WHOMEVER it is addressed. Postman doesn't want to lose his comfy government job now!

    people can over think this...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i reckon it just deserves to be said that, for people who are ordering a gram of coke or a half of weed, i wouldn't personally be bothering with any of this shit - i just get it sent to my house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if the vendor is doing their job properly, there shouldn't be any risk in the domestic post for such a small amount. fortunately, of the 6 or 7 pot vendors that i've ordered from, none of them have given me any cause for concern with packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    although i must say, i dislike this trend towards single shrink wrapping - the internationals all do double, it would be my preference that the domestics did double.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i recognise that most people here were talking about larger orders - but when people start talking about amounts small enough to get through the mailbox slot, that makes me think that for pot, if it can get through your mailbox slot, just get it sent to your house.

    You're not the only person to have thought of this I can tell you that much and I can also tell you that if you can't feel comfortable having orders shipped internationally or you don't have the smarts to find a comfortable way to have them sent then you shouldn't even be using SR so really that post only benefits those who shouldn't even be on here.

    Those claiming no shows are mostly from international vendors however the debate as to what is the real story behind this rumbles on, there is credible evidence to suggest that Australian LE has infiltrated SR by opening buyer accounts, ordering then claiming seizures to spread fear and mistrust in both buyers and vendors alike. Not saying that customs don't intercept the occasional package because they obviously do but they are not the impenetrable fortress some would have you believe.

    It seems since Sep 5 heavier enforcement at customs... read yourself... **CLEARNET** http://www.theherald.com.au/story/734298/detectives-follow-the-silk-road/?cs=12
    <br/>
    <br/>
    post info for fellow members. see if u find ur order in "statistics" provided in article ;)
    <br/>
    ---------------------
    <br/>
    A LUCRATIVE website that sells illegal drugs is proving a challenge for Esperance detectives to rein in its activities, but as they turn their attention to the online marketplace, detectives are finding local deliveries have “practically stopped.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Silk Road website, which is achieving an estimated $22 million a year in sales, functions similarly to a black market version of eBay, where drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine sell for far less than their street value in Australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Users can access the service using TOR software, designed to mask the user’s location and details, before payment is made via the encrypted digital currency Bitcoin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Esperance Detective Sergeant Stephen Harris said under Operation Cinder detectives had liaised with Australia Post staff who checked their daily parcel deliveries for the obvious signs of a Silk Road posting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ** “Australia Post sees around 100 parcels come through its doors each day in Esperance,” Det Sgt Harris said.
    <br/>
    ** “For the first few weeks, they were finding up to eight packages a week and are now able to spot the signs of a Silk Road parcel straight away.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since September 5, Esperance detectives and Australia Post have intercepted just over 30 packages, containing approximately 0.5kg of cannabis, around 200g of synthetic cannabis, around 5g of methylamphetamine, 1g of cocaine, around 400 tabs of LSD and 30 ecstasy tablets as well as seizing prescription medication such as oxycontin.

    Det Sgt Harris said it was clear a few people were still purchasing synthetic cannabis or ‘synthetic cannabinominetics,’ thinking the drug is legal, as purported by the website.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “This is not the case, the website has providing misleading information on the topic,” he said.[/font][/size]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “Synthetic cannabis is a prohibited substance.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Det Sgt Harris said that because drugs are delivered by post, anyone who uses Silk Road runs the risk of their parcel being intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sellers use techniques to make packaging less detectable and further closer inspection unlikely by vacuum sealing drugs or using ‘professional’ looking envelopes with typed addresses, with most drugs arriving in Express Post bags or birthday cards
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “The message is clear: If you are going to buy drugs through online marketplaces such as Silk Road, you will be caught,” Det Sgt Harris said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Esperance detectives and police will continue to identify, investigate and prosecute individuals and groups importing illicit[/font]

    Australian media is pretty powerful as in whatever they say  people in OZ read it and believe it. Hence why garbage like the herald sun and ACA TT rate and sell through the roof. Australians in general are pretty dumb and can't think for themselves. I don't know if this comes from being chronically lazy or from our low standards of education. whatever it is the media love it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the past few months every month without fail there is an article about SR and it is usually written without facts and is written in a way as to scare the mass simpletons who live in Australia. The mums and dads of suburbia would have no clue as how to get on SR neither will the bogans.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So ignore all the new articles regarding SR..it's just your typical scare mongering from the Oz media who looove putting the fear of god and making people hysterical in Australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Saying that..don't drop the ball and continue to be safe!

    I couldn't agree more ETM. It seems most newbies don't have the will or patience to do some of their own research before starting out. They want everything yesterday. DPR expressed it beautifully when he posted  "Just because you can, doesn't mean you should". There is a lot to take in and comprehend. It's not as simple as some would like to think to stay safe and secure.

    That bust you are waiting for is not going to happen for small amounts, i guess if you are that keen you could take it down to a police station and confess. Thats about the only way its gonna work out negative.
    <br/>
    The overall planning and implementation of government policy is a very shimmering thing, lots of bling, press and big hand movements. The reality is a smaller thing. Last week the watered down internet cencorship legaslation was passed with much cheering. The powers that be, very happy about all the kiddy porn and other that will not get to the screen of the population.
    <br/>
    Yeh! Wotever, as users of the Road you know the actual impact will be zero. Lot of bling not much bang, same goes for any issue, any department the only exception being when theres a profit involved.
    <br/>
    The customs issues are very expensive to deal with efectively and being seen to be doing something is the name of the game.
    <br/>
    Dont waste any precious energy on the thought of a bust, do what you can to minimize exposure and the job is done
    <br/>
    Be proud and confident in civil disobedience

    redbaron, you may have been born here champ but Australian you are not! This is the best country in the world, hands down. If your dumb enough to pay 3 times the cost of something that the price the rest of the world pays then that's no ones fault but your own! The only one exhibiting dumb and ignorant qualities here is you. Your a perfect example of why kids should stay in school. Just as your namesake did all those years ago, you too should "retire from service" and fuck off! The old adage "Just because you can, doesn't mean you should" certainly applies to you.  :(
