    So I ordered from a new but trustworthy vendor. I paid 60e extra for DHL shipping. The parcel left the country and mysteriously came back to the departure place... They said the parcel got damaged or something like that. So I have nothing. Vendor offers me 50% refund and 50% off next order. I personally think that's a pain in the ass and want a reship. Should I have a reship to same adress with DHL or same adress different company or DHL different address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks a lot

    50% refund and 50% off next order would basically mean you could reorder the item again?

    When it's damaged I think they have the right to open it and repack, no? I would hold off for a couple days at least and see what happens. Unless they mentioned what they plan on doing.

    ok so vendor reshipped 25% of order with normal post and arrived perfectly.
    <br/>
    So yeah, sometimes paying 10x more for shipping isn't worth it. First time I actually have a problem is when I got the best shipping possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope he sends the rest of my order otherwise what are my options?
    <br/>

    In other words the vendor is trying to recover some costs thus break even one way or another, however as a buyer it works the same for you, if you understand why hes doing that, you could be nice and accept what he has to offer that way you will be leave smiley faces to each other.
