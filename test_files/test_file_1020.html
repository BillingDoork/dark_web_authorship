    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered a sample of C and never received it, but after getting home this weekend (i work away during the week) i had one of the Royal Mail cards through the post saying that i had an undelivered letter waiting for me at the delivery office that needed to be signed for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now the thing is that i get my stuff sent through in a different name, a name of someone who used to live here, but this recorded letter is in MY name...I never, and i mean never, get recorded letters. Parcels yes, letters no, and i haven't done anything or ordered anything in ages that would require one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My thought are that it could be the Police who have run the address through their records, and sent a love letter through to the registered occupier of the house, rather than through to the name i gave on SR. Does this sound likely to anyone, or am i just paranoid?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Luckily it was only half a G of C and wasn't in my name so i'm not too worried, but just wanted to know if anyone else has received one, and if so whether my situation sounds familiar.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was a UK to UK domestic package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is a love letter, what can i expect?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks all.
    <br/>

    I've not received a love letter, so can't speak from direct experience. But I would have strongly believed any such letter would "legally" have to be addressed to the same addressee as the "problem one". I think you're assuming a bit too much effort on the part of the Feds to double-check registered occupants etc, especially for such a small amount. They would have paid you a visit by now if they were that concerned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You're double-sure you don't have any minor, outstanding debts? Final demands etc are sometimes sent registered to "ensure" you receive it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck, let us know how you get on. I'm sure it's not connected, and I'm more paranoid than most!

    Pretty sure i don't have any debts that i can think of....but might be that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeh, maybe you're right, it might just be bad timing! The problem is the Post Office isn't open until Monday morning so i have to wait until then to find out...with no C to do in the meantime! haha...oh well, hopefully it will be fine.

    Thanks

    Lol same thing happened to me, other member of my household answered the door and mailman asked for me by name and said "only he can sign for it". I was really scared because I was expecting 25 grams of powder from the UK and it was 18 days since marked in transit. Well end of the story is that the next day i found the 25 grams in my mailbox and i found out that the letter that my mailman said that was "restricted delivery" that only i can sign for was from a lawsuit from my next door neighbor( who was suing me for 700 dollars after i told him to "fuck off" after he decided that i scratched his fence )
