    Have any of you already tried to ship using a Poste Restante (post office) address?  Isn't it risky?  What would happen if the post office opens the letter and finds drugs in it, before I pick the package?

    Why would the post office open the letter?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm 99% sure that the guidelines for opening a Poste Restante letter are exactly the same as opening a properly-addressed piece of mail, namely there needs to be cause/x-rays/warrant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, considering that you have to show ID to pick up a general delivery letter I would personally steer clear of them. Unless you have a fake ID, in which case go nuts..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: on the ID thing, I believe that's the case in a lot of countries but it seems that some places (like Finland, apparently) aren't very strict about this so if your PO doesn't require ID this might be a good solution

    I use Poste Restante a lot for deliveries, and also used to use it a few years ago when traveling around the world. It's very safe, I've never had a single letter opened once by any post office, even though some of them were blatantly suspicious, like my family sending me poorly wrapped bulky Cadbury's Chocolate bars in brown parcels when I was in India.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Usually you don't need ID, the fact you have your name and know something is waiting for you is good enough. Some post offices will charge for this service, the most I ever paid was about $8 (£5) in the UK (Scotland of all places...tight bastards).

    Ah, well I believe you do have to show ID in the U.S. at least but if you don't where you're from - it's definitely a reasonable alternative to consider.

    I have sent two separate shipments of bud (1 oz and 2 oz respectively) from the US to a Poste Restante address in Finland. Both made it through customs fine and one arrived within a week.

    Been researching and it seems to be safe, unless you don't get your mail before it's shipped back to sender.
    <br/>
    It gets handled more than normal house letters so higher chance of someoen noticing it smells of weed etc.
