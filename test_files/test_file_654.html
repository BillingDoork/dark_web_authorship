    this wasnt my first significant order from this vendor....so of course i had trust.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i ordered a couple of oz's of weed via tracked and signed for delivery a while back from the vendor i had used before with no problems. anyway, i know he sent the package....but either a)he didnt request it as signed for or b)the postman fucked up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway, long story short, i was out when the package came, postman left it outside front of house on the porch. of course i come back, seen nothing, kept on waiting until i contacted the Post Office and got the story (how i know it was left on a porch).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now i contacted the vendor, whos usually fine. as soon as i said im a bit confused he just went shitty at me. told me how he didnt care about my history, how to take it up with SR. he told me how he didnt believe the postman left it out front...accused me of lying. maybe its a language boundary as english isnt his primary....but hes being extremely shitty.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now i FE'd as i didnt want to tarnish my newish account, plus i trusted him to of sent it. since this, he sent me the information on the tracking.....the one he accused me of lying about.....to find out that the tracking confirms it was delivered to the POST OFFICE and NOT my house. now im still not going to complain, i havent asked for a replacement nor refund as on SR you expect one in every several imported packages to go missing ---- so if i am not going to resolution why has he still got to be so shitty with me/?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    how do i resolve the problem with this vendor who with respect is acting kinda childish? id like to do custom again, but he hasnt even apologised, wont answer any of my questions i just get a few sentences of defensive drivvel in return.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im really confused guys...

    I'm sure it's just because for most vendors, when someone says they didn't get something it means stuff is going to have to be resent, refunded or resolved in some way. Most vendors know if they did or did not send something but they have no way of knowing if you did or did not really end up getting it. Don't think anyone ever needs to be a terd about it, but I get it at least. Probably just time to go find a different vendor, plenty of good ones on here for weed.

    It sounds a little fishy for the post office too - If tracking says delivered to the office, but not your porch, and they claim they gave it to you...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That means it got placed on your porch and stolen (not vendor's responsibility), or customs got it, and instead of trying a CD, they're discreetly trying to make you go to the post office and say, "I'm expecting x package, according to y shipping info," at which point you'll have claimed it as yours,

    once a vendor sends you a package if it arrives at the place you asked him to send it to its not his responsibility at that point, the vendor can't do anything for you anyway if I got this straight he sent you the package, it arrived at your house and was left there (according to the Post office) now the package is gone, well when a package gets left anyone could have taken it at that point and i doubt anyone at the Post Office is going to be of much help.  I don't know what to tell you and the tracking shouldn't say delivered to Post Office if he delivered it to your house he has to have proof that he did meaning he scanned it and then the tracking should show delivered to your address, otherwise how the hell are they claiming you have it if their own tracking ends at the post office, You could definitely push them on that but if they say they delivered it and can't find it sounds bad on them I would think.  Hope you have some luck

    Well 2 choices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.  Give it up and figure shit happens sometimes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2.  Send is a resolve with Sr.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it were me, and it wasn't much, I would simply right it off, and take my business elsewhere.    U never know, a neighbor kid could have stolen it.   Aliens, a rabbit,  or anything.
    <br/>
    The good thing about the road is if one vendor isn't very nice to do business with, u can find a new one. (again maybe not even his fault)

    thanks for the replies.

    i believe he sent it, but i requested for it to be signed for, mainly so the postman wouldnt of left it at the porch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now the post office are saying they would never leave an item requiring signature on a porch,  but the vendor is saying he sent it signed for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as i said i fe'd but hes being still being shitty. ill make one more order from him, if the air is still as bad after that ill go elsewhere.

    Maybe try another vendor, or some kind of test package? Switch up the variables, because if it isn't his fault, and another doesn't show up for the same reason, it'll just cause more bad blood to blame him for it.

    today from the postman ive seen proof it was sent tracked and not signed for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so i paid a small fortune for a service i didnt get which is a shame. vendor doesnt seem to care about custom so i agree i think its time to move on. im gutted because even though we were pretty early days i thought everything was ok.
