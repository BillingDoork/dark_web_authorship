    Ok I got tired of all these rumors and speculation so I simply polled a 8 (so far) of the top most popular overseas vendors asking them about their current success rate to the australia the beautiful. All vendors replied promptly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course the vendors could be padding their stats but their answers are fairly consistent. Between 0% and 10% don't make it. I actually expected worse given what has been said here, in particular I expected one or two vendors to state that they were not interested in shipping to oz (because they'd been profiled by customs, and were having no luck).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “At the moment we await a few. I can let you know in a week or so.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “We've done well... Two packages that shipped from (far east country) disappeared, however none of what we've shipped from the US has disappeared or been seized.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “Thank you for your interest. I already have positive feedback from AUS orders.”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “my succes rate is good to aus tthe only thing is that it can get up to 3weeks when it arrives”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “I am not fore sure but I think 10%” (regarding failure rate)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “don now exact our overall rate is more then 90%”
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “ is no problem from 200 transaction to AUS 20 not arrived but i gave reship”

    I think the above success rates are probably a little inflated.
    <br/>
    Reason being that a lot of people probably don't want to raise the issue of missing parcel for fear of getting blacklisted or fucking their buyer stats. Also the vendors don't want to lose your pontential business...
    <br/>
    Personally i'm in the 70-80% received range...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's one response i got from a vendor about a month ago when i asked the same question:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "no,worst country in the world to ship anything into
    <br/>
    probably 50/50 on a good day"

    Replies are still drifting in, another:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I ship from the UK, so far to AUS its 99%, one went missing but i don't know if that customer scammed me or not. But 10 other orders got into AUS so i think its fine to be honest."
