    Wanted to be sure and Post this. I have about 3-5 USPS outlets that I randomly ship Priority Packages from. This last week I went to one of the Offices that is out of the way and typically my favorite drop off. Anyway, what was different this time was that as soon as my parcel was placed on counter, the usps official put on some gloves, then asked me the typical safety questions. He handled the item carefully, weighed it then made some Notations on a binder.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This had never happened before. As it turns out, the shipment did make its destination. I really wanted to ask clerk why they were now wearing gloves, but I felt it was better to not rock the boat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone else experienced this?

    I see the same two guys everyday working the counter at a post office I use. The one on the left always has some gloves on and the one on the right never does. I never thought anything of it. I just think they are trying to keep their hands clean from all the crap they have to touch all day. I have also noticed a lot of cashiers doing this at Wal Mart and grocery stores. I would not worry about it too much.

    Yeah, my mailman always wears gloves.  Sketched me out the first time i noticed on the day of a drop, but I see the normal mail coming this way too.  They just don't want to touch those dirty ass packs all day.  Nothing to do with your dr00gs.

    You should be okay, my friend is a vendor but I am not, so I sent some normal packages at various places to test how they handle them before he started sending his packages and some of them used gloves while some didn't. Sometimes it depended on the day, and the same people would occasionally wear gloves when they usually didn't or vice-versa. You'll be fine.

    Nothing out of the ordinary here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Workers in warehouses, postal facilities etc that handle boxes always wear gloves for safety

    You probably don't want to hear this, but I'll say it anyway. In my opinion, having your customers getting their packages a couple of days early, is not a good enough reason to use priority. You ought to be using standard mail and putting them into random mail drops. There is the little matter of CCTV stills from dozens of package drops with your face on them. And it doesn't sound as if you're wearing gloves, given the situation of handing over a package it looks suspect, so your prints are probably on those package exteriors, yes?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know your customers want packages ASAP. But they are not the ones taking the risk. The absolute maximum difference is six days, but should much less in most cases unless it's peak seasonal times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are shipping opiates across state lines, you come under federal law instead of state, and you could be looking at decades behind bars just for a couple of grams as a result. I think that applies even down to as little as 1 gram of h if I remember rightly. Throw in a variable like a high school being within 1/2 km of the post office or your house or whatever it is in your state, or previous history, or having a crappy lawyer and we're very quickly talking about life imprisonment. Whatever your margin on faster delivery is, it is never that high.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is better to train your customers to plan ahead instead of leaving purchases to the last minute. If they can't deal with that then you don't need a customer like that. Depositing packages into random USPS mail drops wearing gloves or using another technique in the next zip code is infinitely safer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's your prerogative.
