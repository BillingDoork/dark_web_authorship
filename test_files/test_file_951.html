    No, we don't worry about fingerprints because we use gloves. I'm sure you will be worried though when one of your packages gets intercepted and you didn't use them. You don't have to use latex gloves either. Any gloves will do the job.

    On the freenet is a tutorial how to steal someones fingerprints, make dummy's of them which you can place on your own fingers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So if you can even get some dna of that other person, you can place anyonyones fingerprints with some dna.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For most judges will that be enough evidence to convict the owner of the fingerprints.

    Oh, okay, I guess vendors can just do it all bare-handed then.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Part of the gloves / glove changes routine is to maintain smell-sterility between each step of the process - and that IS a concern. Triple sealing is useless if you handle the third seal with the same gloves you did the first.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Though its one of those stories passed around - I hope when vendors send letter-sized amounts, they use a damp sponge or something to seal the flap. I heard some story about a guy being caught by DNA he licked onto an envelope.

    Not any gloves will do, and latex gloves are especially risky. If the gloves are too thin they will conform to the ridges of your fingerprints, turning their outside surface into a rubber stamp. If the gloves have debris on the finger surface, pressing down will essentially stamp the debris onto the surface you touch in the shape of your fingerprint. Latex gloves are too thin and often they are powdered, making them a very risky choice.

The most important fact dealing with the lack of fingerprints is that it neither suggests, implies, or establishes that any person did or did not touch the item of evidence.  Items which have been witnessed to have been handled and laboratory experimentation repeatedly reiterate this premise".

    Yes they will. Why the fuck would they not. If a vendor is shipping drugs LE wants to bust them. If they don't use gloves, they will have fingerprints all over the package. If LE gets fingerprints off the package, and find a match for the vendor, then the vendor is busted that easily. Fingerprinting intercepted packages is possibly the easiest way to bust most people who ship drugs. You are god damn hopelessly deluded and quite likely fucktarded if you think LE will not fingerprint intercepted packages. USPI has an entire lab dedicated to forensics on intercepted mail. You live in a total fantasy world and obviously have not got the slightest god damn clue about reality if you really think that they will not fingerprint packages, so please do yourself a favor and shut your stupid ass mouth before you make yourself look like the biggest idiot in the world, again.

    Don't let the fact that every single case can't be solved with fingerprints cloud your mind into touching everything with your bare hands. That is just beyond fucking stupid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why you don't need to wear a condom when banging random prostitutes in Africa:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. HIV is not always transmitted during sexual intercourse, and it doesn't always take hold and cause an infection
    <br/>
    2. Maybe you just get a blowjob, that has a much lower risk of transmitting HIV
    <br/>
    3. Not ALL prostitutes in Africa have HIV in the first place
    <br/>
    4. Maybe you are a natural resistor, something like 1% of male Caucasians resist HIV infection to such an extent that they are virtually immune
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Saying that you don't need to wear gloves when you handle illegal packages is pretty much the same as saying you don't need to wear a condom when you bang random African prostitutes, and then giving the above list of reasons. In other words, it makes you look like a dumb ass who is about to get infected with HIV.

     Saying that you don't need to wear gloves when you handle illegal packages is pretty much the same as saying you don't need to wear a condom when you bang random African prostitutes, and then giving the above list of reasons. In other words, it makes you look like a dumb ass who is about to get infected with HIV.

       This is an excerpt.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       "Often, detectives are disappointed and prosecutors are frustrated with the lack of the irrefutable evidence of the suspect's fingerprints on a particular item of evidence, which he must have handled. It is unfortunate that, unlike on television, the ï¿½suspectsï¿½ prints don't always appear.  A look at the factors influencing the chances of obtaining prints will assist in understanding the fragile and elusive nature of latent impressions.  Each of the following various factors independently or in combination can account for the lack of prints on a surface:  1) Individuals don't always have a sufficient quantity of perspiration and/or contaminates on their hands to be deposited,  2) When someone touches something, they may handle it in a manner which causes the prints to smear,  3) The surface may not be suitable for retaining the minute traces of moisture in a form representative of the ridge detail, and 4) The environment may cause the latent print to deteriorate. The most important fact dealing with the lack of fingerprints is that it neither suggests, implies, or establishes that any person did or did not touch the item of evidence.  Items which have been witnessed to have been handled and laboratory experimentation repeatedly reiterate this premise".

      Don't let the fact that every single case can't be solved with fingerprints cloud your mind into touching everything with your bare hands. That is just beyond fucking stupid.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Why you don't need to wear a condom when banging random prostitutes in Africa:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      1. HIV is not always transmitted during sexual intercourse, and it doesn't always take hold and cause an infection
      <br/>
      2. Maybe you just get a blowjob, that has a much lower risk of transmitting HIV
      <br/>
      3. Not ALL prostitutes in Africa have HIV in the first place
      <br/>
      4. Maybe you are a natural resistor, something like 1% of male Caucasians resist HIV infection to such an extent that they are virtually immune

    Since you are clearly clueless, I will take some time from my busy day to explain to you something called an INTERSECTION ATTACK, one of the fundamental types of forensics (correlation is another!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's say you touch the outside of the envelope and get your fingerprints on it. Now, as you are hopelessly clueless, you incorrectly assume that it doesn't matter because your fingerprints will blend in with the fingerprints of dozens of other people who handle the package. Now when your package is fingerprinted after being intercepted, the detectives find 12 unique prints belonging to 12 different people. Whew, you may say to yourself, I am totally safe! Now, assuming they don't zero in on your prints due to the fact that you have previous drug charges and are not someone who works in mailing, the detectives just wait. Now they intercept another package from you (or they order another package from you, to save themselves some time!). This time they get 20 unique prints! Whew, you may say to yourself, I am totally safe! Except now those clever detectives take the first set of prints and the second set of prints, and they remove all prints that don't show up on both packages (this is an intersection attack!). Oh no, now only your prints are suspect , because none of the original 12 people who handled your first package handled the second package! Now you are totally fucked!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are obviously new to mailing drugs, and my money is on you being busted in no time if you really don't wear gloves. Welcome to forensics 101.

    ps: how many of your frequently busted friends and family were busted for anonymously mailing drugs? Guess what, it's a different threat model. Comparing what your insecure enough to get frequently busted friends and family do to what your insecure enough to not wear gloves self does is comparing insecure apples and oranges. Obviously fingerprints are not going to be the most likely thing to get a traditional dealer busted, because they hand off drugs themselves, so obviously they will just get busted by an undercover or in a controlled buy.

     Forensic Laboratory Services
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The U.S. Postal Inspection Service maintains a state-of-the-art National Forensic Laboratory in Dulles, VA, comprising highly trained forensic scientists and technical specialists who play a key role in identifying, apprehending, prosecuting, and convicting individuals responsible for postal-related criminal offenses. Its mission is to provide scientific and technical expertise to the criminal and security investigations of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. Laboratory services are divided into the units described below.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Photo of the National Forensic Laboratory
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Questioned Documents Unit
     <br/>
     The Questioned Document Unit provides technical assistance to Postal Inspectors who are investigating suspected violations of postal statutes. Document Analysts process requests from Inspectors to determine the authenticity of questioned or disputed documents. Analysts determine authenticity through the following procedures:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Comparing "questioned" and "known" handwriting, typewriting, commercial printing, and other machine or mechanical impressions.
     <br/>
     Analyzing paper and ink.
     <br/>
     Restoring eradicated and obliterated impressions.
     <br/>
     Visualizing indented handwriting impressions.
     <br/>
     Detecting altered and counterfeit impressions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fingerprint Unit
     <br/>
     The Fingerprint Unit provides technical assistance to Postal Inspectors who are investigating suspected violations of postal statutes by identifying suspects who have handled items of evidence. Latent Print Analysts are responsible for the following activities:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Developing latent (invisible) prints on evidence.
     <br/>
     Comparing a latent print to a known fingerprint, palm print or footprint of suspects.
     <br/>
     Preparing charts demonstrating identifying features of "questioned" and "known" prints.
     <br/>
     Testifying in court to latent print identification.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Fingerprint Unit interfaces with numerous automated fingerprint identification systems nationwide to assist in matching latent prints with local offenders.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Physical Sciences Unit
     <br/>
     The Physical Sciences Unit, which includes a Physical Evidence and a Chemistry section, provides scientific support to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service offices nationwide. Analysts in this unit are engaged in a variety of functions, as follows:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Conducting chemical analyses.
     <br/>
     Performing physical examinations and comparisons.
     <br/>
     Providing expert testimony in court.
     <br/>
     Processing crime scenes.
     <br/>
     Training Postal Inspectors.
     <br/>
     Interacting with other forensic science professionals.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Analysts in the Physical Evidence section conduct chemical analyses, examinations, and comparisons of these materials:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bomb debris and intact explosives.
     <br/>
     Firearms, tool marks, shoe, and tire impressions.
     <br/>
     Trace evidence such as adhesives, fibers, hair, paint, paper, plastic, rubber, and insulation from safes and tape.
     <br/>
     An accelerant from suspected arson fires.
     <br/>
     Serial number restorations.
     <br/>
     Tampered U.S. Postal Service equipment and mail.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Chemistry section supports Postal Inspectors across the country by analyzing materials suspected of being controlled substances. Some of the more common controlled substances found in the mail include the following items:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Cocaine
     <br/>
     Heroin
     <br/>
     LSD
     <br/>
     PCP
     <br/>
     Amphetamine
     <br/>
     Marijuana
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Forensic Chemists conduct a variety of chemical analyses and testify to their findings in court, including the following:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     High-performance liquid chromatography (normal and reverse phase).
     <br/>
     Mass spectrophotometry (chemical impact and electron ionization).
     <br/>
     Gas chromatography.
     <br/>
     Four
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Digital Evidence Unit
     <br/>
     The Digital Evidence Unit has offices throughout the country. The unit is led by an Assistant Inspector in Charge located at the National Forensic Laboratory and is comprised of Inspector Program Managers, Forensic Computer Analysts and Ad Hoc analysts domiciled in each of the eighteen Inspection Service Field Divisions. In addition, there are Audio/Video Forensic Analysts located at the National Forensic Laboratory.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Digital Evidence Unit is the principal group responsible for the collection, preservation, and examination of computer digital evidence in support of all Inspection Service investigations. Digital evidence analysts are tasked with examining computer evidence and any digital media for information or data pertinent to Postal Inspection Service investigations.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Computer evidence may include:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Desktop computers
     <br/>
     Laptop computers
     <br/>
     Cellular phones

    You are the last person who should be talking about common sense considering you clearly have none. Common sense is to wear gloves when committing a crime that could leave fingerprints behind. Only a total idiot would try to argue otherwise. Any vendor on this site could send drugs to LE over and over again. Vendors on SR sell to anybody. LE could easily get a box and order packages from vendors over and over again. If you read the leaked report from the Australian feds it said that they did just that, trying to gather fingerprints and other forensic evidence, but that they failed to identify anybody because nobody was leaving trace evidence behind. If they pull that shit on you your ass is going to be in jail in no time, because you think that mail will not be fingerprinted, and that you cannot even leave fingerprints in the first place for some reason. I am not going to compile statistics for the number of people busted by fingerprints for fucks sake, you are the one who is putting yourself at risk do your own fucking research.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fingerprints are way more likely to sink you than hair, but you should of course try to avoid leaving ANY trace evidence. Wear a fucking hair net too! But unless you become a suspect in a rape case or fuck a minor chances are you will die without ever having your DNA stored by the state. On the other hand, if you get arrested for a DUI or any other minor crime, or get any job that requires a security clearance, your fingerprints are going to be on record with the state. Assuming neither are already on record, given the choice between the feds having my fingerprints tied to an illegal crime, and the feds having my DNA tied to an illegal crime, I would go DNA all day.

     Although the word latent means hidden or invisible, in modern usage for forensic science the term latent prints means any chance or accidental impression left by friction ridge skin on a surface, regardless of whether it is visible or invisible at the time of deposition. Electronic, chemical and physical processing techniques permit visualization of invisible latent print residues whether they are from natural sweat on the skin or from a contaminant such as motor oil, blood, ink, paint or some other form of dirt. The different types of fingerprint patterns, such as arch, loop and whorl, will be described below.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Latent prints may exhibit only a small portion of the surface of a finger and this may be smudged, distorted, overlapped by other prints from the same or from different individuals, or any or all of these in combination. For this reason, latent prints usually present an “inevitable source of error in making comparisons,” as they generally “contain less clarity, less content, and less undistorted information than a fingerprint taken under controlled conditions, and much, much less detail compared to the actual patterns of ridges and grooves of a finger.”[6]

    Of course a latent print is less useful than a print obtained by coating your fingers in fucking ink and rolling them on fingerprinting paper, but latent fingerprints are enough to ID people in many cases. If you want to risk being busted over a preventable insecurity be my fucking guest, I just thought I would point out to you that you are a total idiot.

    I'm gonna end my posting on this topic here, cause I keep running into people who don't read and comprehend fully.  Not never did I say don't wear gloves or take precaution.  I comment to introduce thinking into the equation.  First of all you have to be in the damn system to be matched to a print, that seems to have escaped the smart ass that commented about forensics 101.  Here is common sense 101 for ya buddy!  If your in the system already and you don't wanna go back to jail then it's not even a question of gloving up and protecting yourself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assumptions never stop making asses of people!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Smarty pants postulated that I have not been in the business for that long or that I will be arrested soon.  lol  If you are serious about safety and wanna take precautions you don't ever even have to touch a piece of work yourselves!  I hope you can put 2 and 2 together and understand what it is I'm saying.  I don't know however, cause I am still awaiting my numbers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My first post on this already should have explained the delicate nature of fingerprinting.  If you noticed that list of departments working for the the mail system it's because they need more than a print to convict, or build a case even.  I don't suggest you help them by providing a print, just wanted to elaborate on it.  Thanks for listening!

        (The following paper was the text of a presentation at a training seminar for Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorneys on November 14, 1992)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This is an excerpt.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Often, detectives are disappointed and prosecutors are frustrated with the lack of the irrefutable evidence of the suspect's fingerprints on a particular item of evidence, which he must have handled. It is unfortunate that, unlike on television, the ï¿½suspectsï¿½ prints don't always appear.  A look at the factors influencing the chances of obtaining prints will assist in understanding the fragile and elusive nature of latent impressions.  Each of the following various factors independently or in combination can account for the lack of prints on a surface:  1) Individuals don't always have a sufficient quantity of perspiration and/or contaminates on their hands to be deposited,  2) When someone touches something, they may handle it in a manner which causes the prints to smear,  3) The surface may not be suitable for retaining the minute traces of moisture in a form representative of the ridge detail, and 4) The environment may cause the latent print to deteriorate. The most important fact dealing with the lack of fingerprints is that it neither suggests, implies, or establishes that any person did or did not touch the item of evidence.  Items which have been witnessed to have been handled and laboratory experimentation repeatedly reiterate this premise".

       Don't let the fact that every single case can't be solved with fingerprints cloud your mind into touching everything with your bare hands. That is just beyond fucking stupid.

       <br/>
       Why you don't need to wear a condom when banging random prostitutes in Africa:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       1. HIV is not always transmitted during sexual intercourse, and it doesn't always take hold and cause an infection
       <br/>
       2. Maybe you just get a blowjob, that has a much lower risk of transmitting HIV
       <br/>
       3. Not ALL prostitutes in Africa have HIV in the first place
       <br/>

     Let's say you touch the outside of the envelope and get your fingerprints on it. Now, as you are hopelessly clueless, you incorrectly assume that it doesn't matter because your fingerprints will blend in with the fingerprints of dozens of other people who handle the package. Now when your package is fingerprinted after being intercepted, the detectives find 12 unique prints belonging to 12 different people. Whew, you may say to yourself, I am totally safe! Now, assuming they don't zero in on your prints due to the fact that you have previous drug charges and are not someone who works in mailing, the detectives just wait. Now they intercept another package from you (or they order another package from you, to save themselves some time!). This time they get 20 unique prints! Whew, you may say to yourself, I am totally safe! Except now those clever detectives take the first set of prints and the second set of prints, and they remove all prints that don't show up on both packages (this is an intersection attack!). Oh no, now only your prints are suspect , because none of the original 12 people who handled your first package handled the second package! Now you are totally fucked!

    If they don't have your prints then they have nothing to go on. They have a location but any good vendors know not to use the same drop all the time.. I personally use 5 different ones, all 3-10 miles apart.

      No, we don't worry about fingerprints because we use gloves. I'm sure you will be worried though when one of your packages gets intercepted and you didn't use them. You don't have to use latex gloves either. Any gloves will do the job.

     Not any gloves will do, and latex gloves are especially risky. If the gloves are too thin they will conform to the ridges of your fingerprints, turning their outside surface into a rubber stamp. If the gloves have debris on the finger surface, pressing down will essentially stamp the debris onto the surface you touch in the shape of your fingerprint. Latex gloves are too thin and often they are powdered, making them a very risky choice.

    Yes, gloves are a minimum.  Double layered, use a smock or lab coat too.  Hair and bits get in there too like pet hair.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a room with plastic covering all the walls and entrance.  It has a negative air pressure with an exhaust fan sucking and blowing to the outside.  Any contaminates are sucked up by the exhaust fan.  This was a leftover lab gear from growing mushrooms a long time ago.  Now a sterile packing room.   I feel like Dexter Morgan when I'm working in there. . . lol

    Than it is clearly obvious that some vendors have been arrested or had a job where they are required to be fingerprinted like a school for example. (What if my old chemistry professor...nah couldn't be). They are criminals, well drug dealers which isn't a crime in my book as long as you're a dealer that sells real drugs...does it blow your mind some of them have been fingerprinted before?

         <br/>
         <br/>
         "Often, detectives are disappointed and prosecutors are frustrated with the lack of the irrefutable evidence of the suspect's fingerprints on a particular item of evidence, which he must have handled. It is unfortunate that, unlike on television, the ï¿½suspectsï¿½ prints don't always appear.  A look at the factors influencing the chances of obtaining prints will assist in understanding the fragile and elusive nature of latent impressions.  Each of the following various factors independently or in combination can account for the lack of prints on a surface:  1) Individuals don't always have a sufficient quantity of perspiration and/or contaminates on their hands to be deposited,  2) When someone touches something, they may handle it in a manner which causes the prints to smear,  3) The surface may not be suitable for retaining the minute traces of moisture in a form representative of the ridge detail, and 4) The environment may cause the latent print to deteriorate. The most important fact dealing with the lack of fingerprints is that it neither suggests, implies, or establishes that any person did or did not touch the item of evidence.  Items which have been witnessed to have been handled and laboratory experimentation repeatedly reiterate this premise".

        Why you don't need to wear a condom when banging random prostitutes in Africa:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        1. HIV is not always transmitted during sexual intercourse, and it doesn't always take hold and cause an infection
        <br/>
        2. Maybe you just get a blowjob, that has a much lower risk of transmitting HIV
        <br/>
        3. Not ALL prostitutes in Africa have HIV in the first place

    Oh really is that factoid straight out of your stinking asshole? Something tells me it is. Customs know that people with kilos might break them down into 10 gram packages. It is called swarming! If customs just completely ignores 10 gram packs, then everyone will just send their kilos in ten gram installments. Also I would like you to read about something called Interpol, through this organization fingerprints can be matched against world databases! Also intelligence sharing between the country of the shipper and country of the recipient is even more likely. Rotating between 5 different drops is pretty shitty security fwiw. Also the chances of you having your fingerprints on file at some point in time are not that low. A lot of people will be arrested for something at some point in their lives, or join an organization that requires fingerprinting. Feel free to leave your biological signature on all of your outgoing packages, but please stop pulling insta-facts out of your ass and generally talking about things you don't really have a clue about. Opinions are like assholes and I really don't want your stinky asshole pushed into my face when I have my nice pleasant smelling facts and logic already there.

    Hurka-durka durka-doo, durrr let me think about ur logic man. So like I should put my real name on return address becuz customs like totally doesn't care about me sending personal use schedule 1 drugs newayz n like uhm they might not find teh fone book to match my name and address. Fuck you are so right! From now on I send my drugs from real name, press fingerprints all over it, maybe I will draw some blood and rub in on inside of the package as well. I should add some hair too, maybe bust a nut in it for good measure.

    Well to be honest, I would do it because it doesnt take any work at all... BUT
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I work at a forensic center, and NO I am not law enforcement. I am a forensic toxicologist. Never, ever has the biology department received drug packaging to lift fingerprints off. Not once.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now it is possible that the local police department chose to lift these prints themselves, however while this is possible to happen sometimes, for it to happen every-time is unlikely.
    <br/>
    Additionally, if you see the Canadapost you will see how many people are touching your package without gloves...there is prints all over these things....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT how much work is it really to put on gloves. Just wear them, its not like it takes too much work. But if you ever got prints on a package by accident I wouldnt go crazy. Just stay safe and wear gloves from now on.

    There is no excuse for being as safe as possible.  I just wanted people to understand that a print, alone by itself, is not enough to put u in jail for life.  It just seemed to me that that's where this post was heading.  To the land of fear!  People just seem to not think clearly when fear and paranoia come around.  I know for a fact they don't think clearly.  Maybe it's my mistake to expect everyone here to be clear headed.  There is no doubt that there are quite a few junkies running around here.  I spend half my day on these forums, and I take every precaution there is to take, however by the end of the night, I wanna barricade my doors or pack my shit and move to Canada.  That's how much fear mongering and panic I encounter on these forums.  I am not saying it does not serve a purpose.  The fear of being locked down as scared many straight.  But fear left unchecked leads no where!

    Maybe it is outside your field of expertise, but there is a basic forensics technique called intersection that applies to all sorts of things. In this case the attacker would order multiple packages from the vendor, then they would lift prints off of all of them and intersect the crowds until only the vendors prints are remaining. Your fingerprints may hide in a tiny ass crowd on one package, but over two or three or four packages and your prints are the only unique ones left.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Really I am dumbfounded that anybody here would argue against the importance of wearing gloves when packaging things. There is absolutely no debate to be had. My guess is they are either LE trying to create the impression of there being ANY debate in regards to the importance of not leaving fingerprints on shit, or they are trolls, or they are complete fucking idiots. In fact, I am certain that they absolutely must be one of the previously mentioned things.

    I don't think he was trying to say that you should not wear gloves. He was saying if you didn't wear it sending a single package then it is not a big deal. If you are saying that having your fingerprints on a single package would be enough to get you in jail then that is what is dumbfounding. Unless you are from like North Korea or something...

    Yes you should wear gloves...no fingerprints on a single package would not be enough to get you in jail...

    Having your fingerprints on one single package is enough intelligence to get you put under surveillance for enough additional evidence to be gathered to get you sent to prison. If the prints are on the inside of the package it is probably enough to get you raided in and of itself. So yes a single fucking print on a single drug package is enough to get you in jail. It is a huge deal if you don't wear gloves while sending a single package, if the DEA is ordering the package from you to try to gather forensic intelligence ! If you dipshits would read the leaked .pdf from the Australian feds investigating SR, you would see that they ordered packages from vendors here and forensically analyzed them looking for fingerprints and other trace evidence. There is no debate here, you guys are flat out fucking wrong.

    I don't believe for a second that the fingerprints will be used for the declared purpose of securing those documents only. When they have fingerprints of everyone, they will be used in any possible way. So there indeed is something to compare fingerprints left on shipments.

    I agree with that, that's part of what I am saying.  If you know your prints are on file, no matter how they got on file, you absolutely need to take precautions.  Being arrested is not the only time you can get fingerprinted, and once you are in any fingerprint database I would consider that you're prints are available to anyone who really wants it!
