    Hey guys, true n00b here. In fact I only got Tor about two weeks ago...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But anyway, I wanna buy some weed and maybe ket in Australia, but I'm nervous about sending it to my home address. I don't really have anyone else's address to use, but I do live in a duplex...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are your thoughts on getting it delivered to the other half of the duplex, under a similar name, so my neighbours will just leave it at my door?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a different address, but it is a little close to home.. And it'd have to be a similar name so my neighbours don't just think it's an old tenant and throw it out, or worse, open it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I've heard It's usually pretty safe in Australia as long as I order domestic. Any idea if that's true?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any opinions would be appreciated. Cheers  :D

    or just grow a pair and have it sent to you directly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    blending in is the key. how do you know that your neighbor wouldn't just open it and smoke it. seems like more trouble than it is worth to me.

    Fair enough, thanks. Only thing is if I get it sent to my house under a pseudonym, then my housemates might open it. And they're a bit anti-drug...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And even as I was writing that I realise "grow a pair" is the most realistic advice, haha.

    then send it to YOUR name. the plausible deniability  defense that you hear so many people talk about is less likely to work than just having deliveries blend in with the mail you already receive.
