    Gents,
    <br/>
    did you ever heard of a MITM(Man In The Middle) shipping option?
    <br/>
    for example, lets assume there is a facility by a big city that all packages will be sent to,
    <br/>
    the facility will be owned by a quick delivery company that will hand the package to the end client.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a vendor will send the package to the facility with encrypted address that can be decrypt by the MITM.
    <br/>
    the MITM will transfer the package without any knowledge to its content, and will be trusted by all parties.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the shipping to the MITM will be shipped by USPS or any other delivery company.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do you think it is possible to do? do you think it is legal? what kind of problems can you see in this form of shipping?
    <br/>
    Thanks
    <br/>

    Yes, it's possible, it's legal and such services already exist, BUT: it's suspicious, unhandy and does not prevent you more from being caught than the current methods.

    Thanks,
    <br/>
    I am interested, how can you get caught? if the MITM will know when there is a police suspicion on the package, they will easily can ship it to a different address?
    <br/>
    although, I see another problem, that it might be used as a hub for the police to catch the whole network
