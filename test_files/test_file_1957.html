    How would one slip a pistol through the mail, hopefully internationally, though within the US is fine also. I just moved and this new state doesnt require any gun registration so this could be a great opportunity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one idea was to take a new in box microwave over, unbox it upside down, and put the gun inside the oven (to block xrays) then box it back up and seal it on the bottom with clear tape like it was never opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The markup involved would have to be great to cover the purchase and shipping of a micowave oven

    I have no experience in this area but I wonder if it wouldn't be better to somehow disassemble the gun and disguise the pieces rather than the gun itself?

    The way I've seen it done is by shipping parts of the firearm in several separate shipments. This was for an AR-15 which came disassembled and in 8 separate shipments, I'm not sure if a pistol you would need to do this, but seemed like a good idea to me.

    You're in for an "ah... fuck" moment if you try stripping a pistol to conceal it during shipping; it's still going to look *exactly* like a gun in an X-ray.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AFAIK there's nothing you can do to block an X-ray machine seeing the gun that won't also be taken aside and inspected. Trying to conceal anything in this way is going to give the same result as encasing it in a lead box - it's going to be pretty obvious you're hiding something and it'll be opened every single time. I'd say your best bet is concealing it within a decent sized engine or other machinery, though I'm not sure whether these are searched more intensively.

    why there is a discussion about gun packing on this forum when there is a place exclusively for that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not trying to be a prick here I just hate when people mix guns and drugs. It really gives   drugs a bad rep since drugs by itself can only affect (physically) the user, and guns it's quite the opposite.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a personal opinion.
