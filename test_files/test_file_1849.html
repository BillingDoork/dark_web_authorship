    These forums are great. Thanks for your replies to my other questions. Reading around, especially the helpful post from the former postal worker, has convinced me that I should just use my real name and address. It sounds like shipping to a place that doesn't normally receive mail will make the package more suspicious, increasing the likelihood of inspection. The other option I considered is shipping to a neighbor's, but (and I could be missing something), I do not see how this would increase my safety. If they are monitoring the mailbox, they would find me taking the package. Also, it is very likely a neighbor would see me accessing another mailbox. Also, I am not sure I would be capable of identifying the package especially if it is well concealed. Please correct me if I am wrong about any of these points.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All this being said, if I am choosing to do this, I need to know the realistic penalties for the crime. I am looking around, but do not find anything. I do not know any lawyers. The size of the order would matter, I believe. What size do I want, to minimize the penalties if I am caught? Would 1/4oz or 1/2oz realize a "intent to distribute" charge?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most importantly, what penalties would I receive if I were caught receiving these amounts (or more) or mushrooms in the mail? Jail time? Fines?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think everyone should be free to do as they please, obviously. I do not want to sound high and mighty, please bear with me (recreational use I think is a natural right). At the same time I need these drugs as medicine (I could go into for what later, but this might be too much information). I need access to either psilocybin or lsd for my health. I do not know any local dealers. I do not have any contacts. Honestly that regular route appeals to me more. I do not know why it is so hard to find psilocybin mushroom dealers locally. LSD appeals to me because it seems it has less of a risk of detection during shipping. This would be a no brainer for me, and it is easier to store covertly. But I really do need actual LSD and from reading the every LSD thread I could find, I do not feel confident that what is sold is not another chemical with similar immediate effects (but different medical and long term effects, which is what I am using it for). Please correct me if I am wrong on any of this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I look forward to your input. Thankyou.

    You might need to post what country you're in mate. I know you might want to avoid personal details (smart move) but it's hard to advise about laws without knowing where you are. Don't be too specific, country should be enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can let you know that in Australia the penalties aren't too bad for a personal amount. I don't know what this is for shrooms, but for LSD it's 15 tabs or 1.5 mg, and as with most drugs in this range you're more often looking at a fine or a community based order than jail time. This is Australia though, and whilst some of our laws, particularly with drugs, are ridiculous, my understanding is US laws and penalties are far greater.
    <br/>

    This is all second hand research and not first hand experience mind you, so take that with a grain of salt.

    Hi, good call. I am in the US. I have looked online many places but I do not find the actual penalties. Just some news stories about someone caught with mushrooms or lsd. The few penalties i did find sounded very very steep like two years in jail. I know I live in a police state but even that is very extreme. I am also wondering the added penalties for using the mail system. Any infromation or places to look appreciate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also wanted to clarify one other point that I did not articulate well. If I ship it to a neighbor's box or someone else's house, then I would not know when the package is coming or what it looks like. I think this would make it hard for me to find the package quickly while looking through someone else's mail box and I think I would get noticed doing this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did think that it would not be very hard to learn to recognize my local mail man and if someone different shows up this would be a good tip off. Do they always use a different person like a cop disguised? This would be too obvious for most of us.

    I can't say much more about the US than what I have already. No experience myself, but hopefully someone else will jump in with more info.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for controlled deliveries, again it's hard for me to say accurately for you, but it's unlikely for personal amounts in most countries. It's obviously more work than just waiting for someone to answer this thread, but the old topics in the forums really are you friend here.

    I found a lawers' page that had the penalties. He represents these cases often. He said we get up to 2 years in prison for mushrooms. This country is fucking insane. Fuck this shit. I would get sick and die in prison even 2 years. Theres no way to do that. Even tho the ods are very slight I cant risk that because it wouldnt be in my control if I got caughted with it and the fucking cops here would love to do it. POLICE STATE! Im not even ging to try an ordr
