    lol seriously? many have been put in jail for for receiving narcotics in the mail, there have been quite a few articles on here mostly off of SR although ive read the occasional cops knocked on my door threads and one has to add in those who never got to even log in / avoided it if it did happen, if you keep things clean at the location of acceptance and make sure to deny if the package gets compromised you in theory should be good to go, although ive known cops to be fucking assholes when they think something is up just make sure to be stern,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There have been some sellers online that have been busted however some name drops would be enelysion he is serving some 20+ year sentence currently for selling MDMA and LSD onlne, also a vendor named Moveitnice im pretty sure has been arrested that was a vendor here on SR from canada,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything always lead to people being stupid and being greedy, sadly in the drug game the consequences are jail if you fuck up like they did and they are serving hard for it,

    If you have a family lawyer I would make sure to go with that because any joe shchmo will not help you in cases where the evidence is heavily against you unless your paying out the ass, even then you have to be choosy with what you say if the lawyer is some stranger,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the success rate for packages is like 97% and mostly lost packs is the majority of the rest of the missing 3%, all in all choose vendors wisely.. and stick with those who do you good.

    And here's the funny thing - before having anything to do with SR, I wouldn't have thought twice about signing for an unexpected package provided it had my name on it. I'd just figure it was from a friend or family member, and if I didn't recognize the return address, guess maybe it was off eBay. Only now that I have cause to be defensive would I be like: "Wait, I wasn't expecting anything in the mail, Mr. Postal Carrier, sir." But I guess if it was a cd and you signed, try explaining that to the judge.

    Yeah, I don't get who all these people are who think signing for a package is incriminating. There isn't a court in the western world where that would be enough to prosecute. The alternative is WAY more suspicious. Who in a world with ebay and mail-order-everything knows EXACTLY how many packages are headed their way, WHEN they will be arriving and what they will LOOK like beforehand? A paranoiac drug dealer maybe. Or a terrorist.

    Nonchalance is the only, only way...

    Agreed.  Simply accepting a delivery is not illegal, no matter what is being delivered.  Hell, my sister sometimes signs for my packages, when she happens to answer the door.  Signing for a package is not acceping responsibility for the contents--it's merely acknowledging that the package was delivered to the intended address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, if the police have any other suspicion, then they may have enough evidence to charge you, regardless of whether they can prove that the contents of the package were in your posession or not.  Also, if the police end up searching the location, and find anything illegal, then you will be screwed.  This includes evidence of Silk Road on your devices.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The bottom line, sign for the package, delay in opening it, and if you are busted, deny any knowledge and do NOT let them search your property.

    This is the sort of naive, simplistic, uninformed and unenlightened conjecture that serves absolutely no worthwhile purpose.  All it does is muddy the waters. The sole purpose of a CD is to incriminate the target of the investigation by having them take possession of the contraband.  Ultimately, it will be  up to Prosecutor to determine just how incriminating they want to make it but make no mistake..it IS incriminating.

    Just prefer to loose the package rather than signing for it. Lawyers and judment expenses would be much more than the prce you payed for your stuff, simple math. :)

    a bit harsh mate. it's incriminating if used along with other evidence the police may have, but he's right the act of signing for a package alone, is definitely not enough to prosecute someone. that is not conjecture. don't underestimate the burden of proof.

    So the answer to the Op's question is NO ONE has ever been arrested from anything to do with Silk Road. Another poster said he read somewhere that someone had knock on the door...Total bullshit. It has never happened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is recommend by Silk Road to not sign for a package. But signing for a package even if it contains Heroin is not in its self going to be the thing that gets you in trouble. It is just that there is no reason for a vendor to ship you  and Express package and require your signature. So then there would be mo reason to sign.
    <br/>
    But as usual there is wrong information on here and it would be totally safe to sign for a package. Just as it would be ok to use your home address to have drugs shipped to it.

    Not correct. I sat in on a court hearing for a man who'd been sprung ordering from SR recently and someone was jailed in NZ last week.

    I was arrested last year.
    <br/>
    It was my first and last SR order. A letter from holland with blotters(5) &amp; powder (1g).
    <br/>
    I already thought it never comes, but suddenly after 3 weeks a postal notification came to the box.
    <br/>
    I went to the postoffice, but they said postman took my letter and probably I should wait and check my box again. If not, return to the post.
    <br/>
    So I returned to the postoffice at the evening, they gave me an envelope and instantly 5 a.c.a.b.-s busted me.
    <br/>
    They did the search and 'found' the letter (surprised, eh?), then I was brought to the local police station devoted to drug crimes.. where some special acabs tried to frighten me and succeeded. So I told them everything, fucking little coward.
    <br/>
    They got my PC but found nothing special - our IT specialists suck you know. Anyway I was screwed up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They did not imprison me. Lawyer + fine = ~2k$. Conviction.. and the judge promised that NEXT time I'll go directly to prison.
    <br/>
    A.C.A.B.
    <br/>
    Never GO TO THE POST OFFICE.

    Back in the old days there was a place out of Texas you just filled out a profile, talked to a Dr on the phone and he called your RX into a pharmacy which sent it out COD through UPS/Fed-Ex/DHL and when the UPS man showed up u gave him a Money Order for $350-$450 for 180 10's and 120 planks, well we found about 5 diffrent places to do this and one day Fed Ex showed up and my g/f at the time answered the door, i was sleeping on the couch with Xanax in both pockets one in a pill bottle and one in a pill fob that goes on a ket chain, gave him the MO and closed the door, before she opened the package BOOM the door is Kicked in and the "fedEx Man" Mr, Undercover LE and his buddies bust in and Charge us with attempted trafficking in narcotics,and me with Distribution because of having the same pills seperated in two bottles 15 in the Pill Fob and 50 something in the bottle, but in cout it was dismissed because it was from a real Dr. So Yeah we were arrested, Jailed for a week on $100,000 bond then let go at the Pleminary Hearing for lack of evidence.  All thats old news cause the DEA shut all those Pill Shops down real quick but they were REAL nice while they lasted! At least till that DAY LOL

    I'd be interested in hearing more stories.  I have heard that most of convictions come from confessions from the defendents due to the fear and hope that cooperation with LE will lessen their penalty.

    I'd like to see a case where they intercept a small quanity of package but they have no other evidence against you.

    That is absolutely correct, NEVER TALK TO THE POLICE!!! if shit happens get a lawyer and let them do the talking for you, most convictions result from people dropping themselves in the shit, say nothing and lawyer up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perfect example, police pull you over and ask "do you know why I have stopped you sir?" and you answer "ooh sorry I may have been speeding officer" immediately you are banged to rights as you have admitted to an offense. Give them nothing, zero, nada and let the burden of proof fall to them to prove.

    Very interesting story I have to share.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say about, 6 or 7 months ago, around mid March a friend had a package coming in. Very stealth from China and we knew vendor very well and we knew what the stealth was and how it was packaged from doing PLENTY of business with this vendor. Package made it through customs, made it ALL the way to the post office and we searched EMS tracking and it said "Undeliverable As Addressed" Friend called the post office demanding that the package was NOT sent back to the original post and to make sure that the package was delivered to the address on the package. Post office called back a few days later on friends phone and told him to come pick the package up, I got the call from the friend and he told me he was on the way to go get it. Exploding with excitement I was, so happy and so ready to get this. Money's calling, phones blowing up, missing out on PLENTY of bread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Next thing you know its been a couple of hours, I call my friend that was with the person that was supposed to sign the package, and started forwarding my calls. Now I really started panicking, and really got that gut feeling that something went wrong. Something told me to check on one of my OTHER people (the one that actually got the pack sent over) via the jail website in my county. Come to find out he got kicked in by the DEA 2 days prior (AFTER the pack had already made it through customs) and had a "DEA Hold".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally my friend picked up, started trembling talking telling me he had guns to his head and he didn't know what was going on. I hung up the phone immediately. Ran to my spots, emptied EVERYTHING out of EVERYWHERE that I resided and buried everything possible of evidence and illegal things. Next thing you know I get a call from my friend, and he told me they let him go, which was the driver, but kept the person who had to sign for the package which the packages name was under. A couple hours go by and we drove by the post office in an unknown car that has never been linked to me, and nothing was going on, the feds were gone, it was like a normal day at the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My first impression was that they got my friend, they're taking him in and he's going away for a long time. Well, remember how I told you all that we KNEW what the packaging was, and knew all about how it was sent. Come to find out we drove back to friend #1's house that got released 1st, and the friend that had to sign for the package was sitting outside the house!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THEY LET HIM GO...!!!!  They had no choice because it was sent as something we knew about, and he kept denying the fact of any knowledge of any drugs being inside of the package, and just kept telling the feds that it was not any drugs inside of the package from his knowledge and it was just the advertised product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Talk about dodging a bullet! All of this wouldn't of happened if my connect ( the one that got kicked in by the feds 2 days prior ) wasn't dealing with someone who just got out on a $50 bond with Conspiracy to Trafficking MDMA and Conspiracy to Trafficking Illegal Drugs (methylone/m1).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All in all, deny it, have a solid verification with your plug of how it is sent, as in KNOW what it is being sent as, and you will be good. They cant PROVE that YOU know what is inside that package, unless they can do that, your in the clear.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &gt; :  )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just thought I'd share my story with all of you, considering the fact that we did the un-do-able and dodged the feds, because if you all didnt know, when the feds pick up a case they have a 99% chance of conviction being guaranteed, and my fellow partners were that 1%. Good luck to you all, and know your laws before you start dealing with fire like this. Its a dirty game, and anyone you know and think will keep it real when feds have them in the interrogation room, think again, over 80% of the people you deal inside of your "round table" will snitch in a heartbeat. Watch your steps, and walk light so you don't piss the ground off.  8)

    One thing missing from all of the previous posts - is the term  PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's the very fact that you cannot possibly know what's in the package being delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the United States PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY  is a defense.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    May not be the case in other countries. That's why it would be helpful to know what country these "stories" are from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And who "lurks" on the SR forum, that has been busted, and no longer uses SR ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I use my full name, real address, and I don't tell a soul about my habits.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have a bunch of friends all using The Silk Road???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That spells trouble. There's always a weakest link in a chain.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My own family thinks the pills I have are from a doctor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just re-use old bottles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as other substances. Stealth is the word.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as LE kicking down my door??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One of them is getting a hollow-point at close range from my 9mm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Security cameras are inexpensive nowadays. I have 3 that are wireless, in key places leading to my door. I have a window on my PC open all the time with them on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also have a "destroy" program, that by a few simple keystrokes, wipes my computer. It would be useable again, I would just have to install a new OS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Little things like that, help me sleep better at night.

    Looking to make my first purchase soon. I was wondering if i sent the package to my friends house using my computer &amp; something happened would he be able to act like he didn't know what was in the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep in mind I will be making the order from my computer &amp; having it sent to his address....he will have no proof of purchasing anything at all. I'm in the US too.

    <br/>
    I can't say this enough. Don't let anyone know about SR, in your life. Some may think "he needs help". People are so brainwashed that drugs should be controlled, that they will "turn" on their loved ones, thinking they're "helping" them. Then next thing you know word gets out, and you're getting the "setup" or "sting" scenario we all fear in the back of our minds.

    I like the way you think jagfug, you have the right attitude... loose lips, sink ships
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I believe it is somewhere in the region of 80% of all busts are derived from either snitches directly or associates/friends doing a 'deal' to reveal their dealers identity for a lighter sentence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I believe that working their way 'up the ladder' by offering lesser charges (lighter sentences) or even often offering complete immunity for testimony in court against the 'dealer' is the routine method of investigation LE uses in drug matters. They may even do up to ten 'deals' to get to more senior dealers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems comparatively few convictions come from 'traditional' investigative police work where they start out with no leads and proactively work from there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I have come to believe after reading various sources over time is that often whether LE offer a 'deal' depends upon what they can ascertain (from the individual now being interrogated or to use their words 'interviewed') of the number of and nature of the dealers ties to his associates (meaning is it worth making a deal to be able to expand the investigation or catch a very high level dealer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a disgusting methodology if you think about it and why one should keep this shit to.ones self.

    Glad to see some mutual understanding on this. Another thing about "receiving things in the mail" - Do more shopping online. Ebay packages look more like drugs than SR ones do !! LOL!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I remember getting one from China, and it had been opened. All they found was a George Harrison CD. So the more the post office is accustomed to seeing packages or parcels from around the globe, the less likely they will suspect you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also I hope Vendors use their head and put "Merry Christmas" with stickers and all that crap that my sisters always do. This is the least likely month to have them bother a package. Especially with Christmas or Chanukah themes on them.

    I havent been arrested, but I am currently under customs investigation. The customs found a letter containing a very small amount of cocaine (less than 0,5g) and I received a letter about it and I was asked to call them about it. I never called them. I thought they just let it go, since it was a tiny amount, but after more than six months later I received another letter that said that I have to go to the customs office for an interview. But as I moved away from that address, I received it late so didnt even know about it in time so, I had to schedule another time. Why? Because the letter said also that they have made a search request of me to the police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is in one of those Scandinavian countries. I strongly advice against ordering from NL, even though all the others have passed customs before. Naturally I am not going to say shit, dont know if it works here.

    the feds think they are so smart. little do you all know federal investigators are average normal people off the street that have barely any common sense and cannot hide their doings at all and fucking suck at what they do, and then you have the ones that have been doing it for decades and are professionals.

    <br/>
    once upon a time i noticed a "light" a few years back at one of my boss's trap spots, the light was always in the same spot for a few nights in a row. very bright blue led light across a field, and i could only see this light at a certain angle, if i were to move to the left or the right from this certain spot, i wouldnt see it anymore.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one day i seen it, again! and noticed it was coming from a CLEAN ass benz brand new on some rims, looked like a good 60grand vehicle. i said fuck this, lit a cigarette and walked towards it, i told my people to stay back and watch as i got closer to see what happens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    as soon as i hit the corner to the street to where they were at, my associates said the light turned off and i seen the benz going about 30mph in reverse and turned down a side street and a van follow it. like really?! i know they have sound devices that can hear for a very long distance and cameras that zoom in very closely and can snap pictures very quickly and precise, so my game has been on tight for a while with what i talk about ANYWHERE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i love writing big information about whats going on in the underground on a piece of paper and handing it to the associate next to me to read details about whats available/what were about to do/ etc etc (you know the deal) then flush/burn the evidence. nowadays i take all precautions, to the FULLEST extent.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    receiving drugs in the mail is like waiting for your dealer to come drop off your pack, you dont know if the feds are following him, you dont know if he's setting you up because he just got busted, were ordering from an underground market, therefore what is said at the table, needs to stay at the table, if you feel my drift. share nothing about the road, we have enough resources already on the road we dont need any more idiots knowing about this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i swear to god in the past 2 weeks ive had 3 different people tell me "you should start using silkroad bro" i tell them ive heard about it and i tell them its all scams and/or feds will be at your door messin with that kind of thing. the word is getting out there, and quick.

    Damn right its getting out there....just when i've been a member for a week, i hear of our local newspaper doing a story on it...unbelievable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But its the governments fault. They stamped out all the good clean drugs that were always available.....but then that left a gate open for idiots to produce shit product, etc.
    <br/>
    They allow us to go buy tobacco and alcohol, the 2 worst drugs there is, prescription meds, etc. But oh no you cant go out and feel euphoric....empathy, etc. Who's dying from mdma and cocaine?

    Use a prepaid android mobile phone and keep it away from the address you are ordering from. When the package arrives leave it unopened and leave the house and come back again a few times. If the feds were there then surely they have to pounce if they say you potentially leaving the house with the package immediately. I think if they bust you before youve opened it then youve got a good chance youl be fine. Although youl definately get a little red star next to you name somewhere so id think about everordering from that address or name.
    <br/>
    Remember they have to be beyond reasonable doubt. In the uk unless it was a large amount I doubt you'd even get a visit from the feds because they know there risking needing more evidence at your address and they dont know how vigilant/sloppy you are.

       I'd say about, 6 or 7 months ago, around mid March a friend had a package coming in. Very stealth from China and we knew vendor very well and we knew what the stealth was and how it was packaged from doing PLENTY of business with this vendor. Package made it through customs, made it ALL the way to the post office and we searched EMS tracking and it said "Undeliverable As Addressed" Friend called the post office demanding that the package was NOT sent back to the original post and to make sure that the package was delivered to the address on the package. Post office called back a few days later on friends phone and told him to come pick the package up, I got the call from the friend and he told me he was on the way to go get it. Exploding with excitement I was, so happy and so ready to get this. Money's calling, phones blowing up, missing out on PLENTY of bread.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Next thing you know its been a couple of hours, I call my friend that was with the person that was supposed to sign the package, and started forwarding my calls. Now I really started panicking, and really got that gut feeling that something went wrong. Something told me to check on one of my OTHER people (the one that actually got the pack sent over) via the jail website in my county. Come to find out he got kicked in by the DEA 2 days prior (AFTER the pack had already made it through customs) and had a "DEA Hold".
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Finally my friend picked up, started trembling talking telling me he had guns to his head and he didn't know what was going on. I hung up the phone immediately. Ran to my spots, emptied EVERYTHING out of EVERYWHERE that I resided and buried everything possible of evidence and illegal things. Next thing you know I get a call from my friend, and he told me they let him go, which was the driver, but kept the person who had to sign for the package which the packages name was under. A couple hours go by and we drove by the post office in an unknown car that has never been linked to me, and nothing was going on, the feds were gone, it was like a normal day at the post office.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My first impression was that they got my friend, they're taking him in and he's going away for a long time. Well, remember how I told you all that we KNEW what the packaging was, and knew all about how it was sent. Come to find out we drove back to friend #1's house that got released 1st, and the friend that had to sign for the package was sitting outside the house!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       THEY LET HIM GO...!!!!  They had no choice because it was sent as something we knew about, and he kept denying the fact of any knowledge of any drugs being inside of the package, and just kept telling the feds that it was not any drugs inside of the package from his knowledge and it was just the advertised product.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Talk about dodging a bullet! All of this wouldn't of happened if my connect ( the one that got kicked in by the feds 2 days prior ) wasn't dealing with someone who just got out on a $50 bond with Conspiracy to Trafficking MDMA and Conspiracy to Trafficking Illegal Drugs (methylone/m1).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All in all, deny it, have a solid verification with your plug of how it is sent, as in KNOW what it is being sent as, and you will be good. They cant PROVE that YOU know what is inside that package, unless they can do that, your in the clear.

      That must have been pretty big package.  Mind sharing with us how much powder the package had?  Was it in realm of kilos?

    Im assuming you referring to guy in melb - which has been documented - was some amateur charged with multiple counts of whatever the charge is, address got flagged but continues to use it, the fool deserved to get pinched.
    <br/>
    The NZ one was similar but even more foolish - used the same address for months til it got flagged, so what do they do? They order another 10-12 international packages to the same damn address in short space of time, cops got all the packages after address was flagged, so basically handed to them on a platter.
    <br/>
    In both cases the arrests were not the results of fine police work, just dumb individuals.
    <br/>
    Common sense is all you really need, and if you loose any sr international package, whether you get a customs letter or not - assume the address is flagged and find another - and as always, if LE ever do ask questions, deny everything no matter what they say.

    Having things sent to friends house is kinda selfish. I wouldn't want to bring anyone else down with me. As long as you're getting personal amounts and are being on top of your shit then there shouldn't be much worries. You'll minimize your risk. But That risk can never be eliminated.

    i think its too hard to be arrested, mail can be sent from anyone to anyone... just the other day i checked my letter box and had mail thought it was just another Christmas card opened it up and there was a little surprise in it for me, I hadn't ordered it, no return address and it had my full name on it plus the address had only been given to one vendor previously and that order had been seized, just shows anyone can try and "screw" you over, also if it was controlled i had plausible deny ability fortunately nothing came of it and i enjoyed my little something so just goes to show how flawed postal service it can be to get you by mail unless you open your mouth.....

    that's right bobyouruncle,  The cops need to prove you brought the product, if they don't have your computer or catch u in the act of opening the package there is no proof. Any vindictive bastard can set anyone up with a postal delivery.

    Some good advice in this thread. the best being if you do get called into the cops, do not say a word. you've gotta stay strong. yeah it would be stressful being in an interview room knowing you've done something dodgy, but talking will NEVER help you. NEVER. if they're going to prosecute you, they'll do it without your testimony, and if they do charge you, you can see the evidence they have against you and then make a decision where to go from there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it's also good advice to keep it pretty on the hush with friends and/or acquitances. this is something i myself haven't done, though at the same time i haven't been parading through the streets what i've been getting up to.
