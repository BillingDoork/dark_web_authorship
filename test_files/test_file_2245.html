    I understand priority mail can take 2-3 days sometimes more (counting the ship date).  Apparently the order was shipped out early Monday and I still have yet to receive anything. Honestly I am scared shitless about it because i've had first class mail make it across the country within 2-3 days from the ship date.
    <br/>
    It makes me wonder because one other pack I had from the same vendor went MIA the last time I ordered but he resolved it and sent it again thank god.  But whats the longest time you guys seen a priority pack take to land?  I'm hanging off the edge of my seat right now. :(
    <br/>

    Thanks and Peace

    Same deal.  I ordered priority and was told it would ship Friday, although per SR it shipped Saturday.  I had an order for a toy (not SR) ship priority Monday and arrive on Wed (this week!).  So my shipment sent Saturday will have taken 5 days if it arrives tomorrow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To make matters worse, my postman delivers between 5-6pm; makes for a long day.  Plus, this is my very first order.  I'm just going to try not to sweat it and hope the package arrives.  Doubt I was scammed and I think, unless it's huge amounts, contraband is discarded by the USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.  I'll update.

    if u google around there are insane stories of priority packages (from "legit" businesses) taking WEEKS so ya fluke shit happens. I had a priority pack from cross coast not arrive after the 5th day so my vendor reshipped express and I received next day no prob. The 1st pack has been MIA since then (4months)

    If your package has been MIA for a month I would assume it got snagged for some reason. I had a friend that had the same thing happen to one of his packages 2 years ago. Then, after about 4-5 weeks they tried to pull a controlled delivery on the address. As if it wasnt obvious...If that package ever shows up I would recommend telling the agent dressed up as a mail man trying to get you to sign for the package that it isnt yours and you wont be signing for it. Problem averted.

    Update:  my order still has not arrived  - if it comes today, it will have been 11 days for priority.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did notice that I had 2 pieces of 1st class mail in my Saturday mail.  One from Monday, June 4th (5 days) and one from Thurs., June 7th (2 days).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do not believe I was scammed, so maybe today is the day!!!

    It arrived yesterday.  Sorry I was tweaking about it - first order an all.  I think this means I am an official SR member now!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The seller shipped 7 days after they marked it as shipped, so it wasn't USPS.  All is good - just happy to have my product - must have been a hiccup because the vendor has great reviews.  Although, he could have told me so I didn't worry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks everyone for the advice and help.

    Yeah, I never confirm before shipping. In fact when I confirm my orders I have the DCNs in hand to send to my customers.

    I like this and play by the same rule.  Only time I ever confirm first is if its an express and I confirm right before I go to send it or the night before, I am almost at 35 but since Im not , this way I can make sure to cut down on the time they have to wait (and I hae to wait) for the finalize option to show up :)  I always PM them and let them know tho
