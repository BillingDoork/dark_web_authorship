    Hey SR Community,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I am expecting a package with a pretty large amount of stuff and everything on the tracking looked normal, until today when it said that the package arrived down in the Southwest. I was expecting my package to arrive, in the Northeast, today, but instead it went to an entirely different region. Does this mean that my vendor may have given me the wrong tracking number or is that what the tracking may show if the feds have seized the package or taken it somewhere else to be screened? The package already cleared customs and everything looked good, according to the tracking, until today when it said "Arrival at Unit" in a completely different region. Please help!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best,
    <br/>

    Don't worry.

    Sometimes my packages go to sorting facilities I have never seen before, or take different routes. Could be short staffed, or the way it was thrown into the batch.

    Tracking international orders is a nightmare. I've had tracking tell me an order came through customs, was processed at a sorting facility on one side of the country, then processed at another sorting facility on the opposite coast, then processed AGAIN back at the first, and then it sat in transit for two weeks before finally being delivered - and this was just for a computer accessory. Not all are so bad, of course, but what's happened with your order is not at all unusual. I wouldn't sweat it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just try not to obsessively check the tracking.  It won't make it get there any faster.  :D

    I agree with the Other posters, Iv had many parcels come Internation before an most of the time i know what routes are gonna show up on tracking (if they update at all) but once in a while it will go way out the other way for whatever reason. It could be something simple as the package getting thrown into the wrong bin an not noticed until it reaches a sort facility then put back on the correct path from there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But of course its also possible he(vendor) may have mixed your track up. Iv onyl had it happen 1 time but i guess when your a vendor handling several tack#s a week it could easily happen. Give it til tomorrow an if it still look off track contact the vendor to double check.
