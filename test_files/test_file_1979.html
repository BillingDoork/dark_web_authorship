    How is this due diligence?  You're takeing precautions against an unkown risk?  A risk that, as far as I know, doesn't exist? Ok, fine. That's a nice slippery slope you got going on there if this is the case.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can say with equal certainty that there is no risk that anyone can access usps using tor and nothing bad is going to happen.  Where did this rumor start?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not arguing with you specificly but the whole "don't use USPS with tor" argument doesn't have anything to back it up, it seems to be an ubran legend and I just would like some clarification on this.  I think many people would like clarification on this.

    It's been common online drug scene etiquette to assume that LEA/USPS has the ability to flag DCN's that are tracked using a Tor exit node.

    Yes, I understand this I think everyone understands this.  It's common knowledge.  We see that all the time, and then when asked people go into some circular argument that leads right back to "it's common knowledge".  Why not break from that and criticly ask the question, "why"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This just spreads mis-information, and this place is chock-full of it.  Can anyone provide an evidence or is this just going to end up being an discussion based on common knowledge and  appeals to fear?

    Yes, I am taking precautions against an unknown risk that may or may not exist, that'd be due diligence, thanks.  If the efforts required outweigh the risk then I might not take the extra pre-caution, but this is talking about either clicking the tor off button and going to usps.com, or just going to usps.com in a copy of chrome/firefox/opera you use on the 'clearnet' ... the effort is ... there is no effort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't like the term common knowledge then let's go with another one, honeypot.  I think even winnie the pooh would be rolling in his grave with envy for the potential honeypot that information leaving a tor exit node provides.  It would take only a handful of programmer's and operator's to amass a list of package tracking #'s (and thus their recipient, aka YOU) being accesed through tor and simply coordinate that information with the DoJ to find 'suspicious' addresses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They are already having a hard enough time trying to mitigate the distribution of small contraband.  They (political entities) generally consider tor to be used for 'immoral' reasons already, so it would only seem logical to pay 5 salaries to increase the # of drug seizures by 10 fold on only the very simple premise that if someone is using tor, and are looking for DCN information that that tracking # should automatically (again the 5 salaries, programming) get dumped into a database.  Send that to DoJ and they now have a platform for combating the distribution of contraband.
    <br/>

    Lets meet in the middle and call this discussion the Honeypot of Common Knowledge.

    Need more information than what your providing to determine if you should be worried or not. You ordered your package and it was shipped on Saturday? Or it left the USPS facility on Saturday? Posts are confusing, try to outline it like:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Date vendor shipped product
    <br/>
    Date package was supposed to arrive
    <br/>
    Date you checked DCN, and what DCN said
    <br/>
    How long did the package sit in any one sorting facility, according to the DCN
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it sits in a sorting facility for a week or longer, it was probably seized and you'll probably get a letter from the postal inspector in a couple weeks. If it's bouncing around to different sorting facilities and is just late, then I wouldn't worry.

    As someone once pointed out to me, DCN is not a tracking number.  I've had them show up a day after they were delivered. It's a little-nerve racking but have a little fait and give it some time.  ;)

    Don't forget the fact that the vendor could have been lying about when he sent it, in which case you're back to waiting for the dcn to update.

     DCN for priority flat rate seems to work as tracking for me. For me, when I drop the packs off, it gets updated when it leaves the post office which is usually around 530pm at my time saying that it has left to go to the sorting facility. Sometimes, it instantly gets updated and shows that usps has the package.
     <br/>
     If your vendor said it was sent saturday and still nothing is updated inthe system, something is wrong :\

     He could have had the ability for  usps to come to his place to pick it up but iono

    Yea, most of the time it works as tracking for me as well but that's not it's intention.  There's no guarantee that it will tell you anything other then delivered.

    ok i just checked usps and still nothing. the vendor Mr Yellow just wrote me and said "Yea give them another day, we drop them in the collection boxes, as apposed to going inside the post office for obvious reasons. They pick those up at the end of the day and i do not know how fast they process them from there. Just a little patience in the name of safety:)"  So say it was dropped off on Saturday in the box. what do you guys think? i want to believe him. real bad. but that's could be because it is like $1900 on the line here. it is two packages. i have some more to add but i will do it on Mr. Yellows review thread. Still holding out hope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    by the way i just sent a package overseas and it got there yesterday but usps tracking says it is still at the sorting facility so they do fuck up and that was a actual tracking number. but to do it for two packages i don't know

     How is this due diligence?  You're takeing precautions against an unkown risk?  A risk that, as far as I know, doesn't exist? Ok, fine. That's a nice slippery slope you got going on there if this is the case.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can say with equal certainty that there is no risk that anyone can access usps using tor and nothing bad is going to happen.  Where did this rumor start?

    On the other hand, isn't there a risk in accessing DCNs in USPS NOT using Tor? After all, in clearnet you're exposing your true IP! Isn't this even more dangerous?
