    Earlier today I went to restock my priority shipping labels, and the first post office told me they were completely out and had been for a few weeks now. I thought that was a little strange, but I just turned around and drove over to a larger post office nearby.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I got to the front of the line I asked for my stamps, and the guy started searching everywhere, asking coworkers if they had any idea where the $5.60 priority stamps were. One of the women brought over a small sheet with only a few on it and said that this was the last of them. Apparently the Post Office has done away with them, leaving me with a few questions as to what this may imply.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The next alternative was buying a $5 stamp and 4 $0.20 stamps per box, which takes up quite a bit of room, and is a bit of a hassle. What other options could be considered over using 5 different stamps per shipment? It also leaves me wondering what the future will hold for using stamps to ship priority anonymously..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This may be common knowledge, but it was a bit of a surprise to me, and I haven't seen any discussion on the forums.

    I seriously doubt they are doing away with Priority stamps and it sounds like no one you spoke with actually stated as much.  Why would they?  The PO's you went to were simply out of stock which is by no means unusual.  You could just as easily have gotten the same response asking for five Express stamps or a book of $1 stamps. The simple fact is retail Post Offices sometimes run out of stamps and it can happen regardless of the denomination.  There's nothing sketchy about using  however many stamps you need to make up the $5.60 total.  Also, you can go online and order all the Priority stamps you want at store.usps.com/store.  They are not traceable.

    I thought about buying them online, but you can never be too careful... And I didn't go into full detail about the remainder of what the woman said, I just summarized. She said specifically that they were doing away with the $5.60 stamps, not just a shortage or sold out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll see if I can find more on it

    maybe they are getting rid of the 5.60's to release the proper 5.80 postage. i dont see how getting rid of priority stamps solves anything, people will just put 3 $2 stamps instead of a priority and .20 stamp.

    Yes, your are right.  There's no conceivable reason why they'd do away with a particular denomination of postage stamp.  It makes no sense not to mention if true..there'd be documentation put out there by USPS.  Changes they make are always accompanied by a press release.

    Or there's one really really good reason; to quietly force people to use their online e-stamp alternatives. The post office has been trying to shift their customers online for years. They don't want you using stamps, it costs money to make them, stock them, and they also tend to be the go-to way to mail illegal items.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about it, you can now only buy pre-paid priority envelopes online. Why not sell them in the stores to make extra money? Have you ever heard of a brick and mortar store that refuses to sell their single most purchased item? Priority is their meal-ticket and they are making it clear that they want all priority transactions to funnel through their online industrial complex.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's only going to get harder and harder each year, and stamps on packages are going to start looking more and more suspicious as the years go on. Think about the last time you got something in the mail that had a stamp on it (not from SR). I can't remember either. And that is exactly how they want it.

    It's like you know my own thoughts better than I do...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I went back and confirmed today that when the shelves empty, they are no longer restocking priority stamps.

    They had plenty of them in my PO recently, we use them at my office all the time for documents/large envelopes, no one said anything. The admin and I buy sheets of them frequently for this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nothing on the storefront or site about this yet. Or etsy/ebay/etc forums.
    <br/>
    Any other information would be great. For my office, as well as here, actually.
