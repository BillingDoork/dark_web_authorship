    Hey all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Usually I try to space out any goodies I get from SR, but I've also been ordering internationally from various countries. My question is, won't a postman with half a brain start to get curious about three or four packages from various countries shipped to the same address, even if they are spaced over 2-3 months? I know I would.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Call me paranoid, but a certain amount of paranoia is healthy. Needless to say I'm going domestic for a while.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What say you?

    I could never get away with that. I live on a rural route &amp; mailmen are biggest gossipers around.

    I can guarantee they'd be calling in FuzzBoys soon as they suspected ANYTHING.

    Def paranoid.... Altho im not from u.s. i dont see how yr post man would get suspicious of a few packages coming in from other countries..... Shop on ebay much? Maybe if they had fucked up return address's on them but who cares im sure yr postie wont care as he just wants to get home and check his own mail box for his sr packages...

    I also live on a rural route, but I order legit stuff from overseas very often (from sites like madeinchina.com and Etsy) and the only time the mail lady ever said anything was when the customs form was marked "tobacco device" (it was an e-cig) because she is trying to quit smoking and wanted to know if I had some Chinese secret for quitting, lol. Lots of them have no return name (just an address) or handwritten labels (from Etsy type people) and I've never had one opened by customs or questioned by USPS.

    It depends.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In a big city there's lots of mail coming from all over the world.   The postman is busy delivering mail and if their route is busy, then he hopefully won't notice anything unusual.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if you're a resident from another country, then it's normal to get mail/envelopes from other countries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The most important thing is to keep envelopes small, discreet and light.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now small cities is a different story.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My 2 cents.

    I have been a bit concerned with this exact subject as well. No problems thus far but I do try to make sure I space out my orders to not draw too much attention. I also fairly regularly order things from over seas so it's not that strange for me to be receiving small bubble envelops. But I am afraid if I received  more frequently it could draw some attention. Probably about go domestic for awhile myself.
    <br/>
    I live in a fairly small country town and gossip travels like wild fire.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck to you  :)

    Hey Bill, it's not so much packages like yours that worry me, but say like, shady-looking. poorly taped packages from half-way across the planet (*cough* fredthebaker *cough*).

    How long have you been waiting, BigBilli?

    I ordered 2.5g opium from them and it took about a month to arrive, genius stealth.

    Thinking of getting a big hash order from them, but not sure how easy 100g is to stealth send.  :P

    Hey Db
    <br/>
    I ve been waiting like 20 days now I ordered 1 g should have been wrapped in foil &amp; vacuum sealed stuck in a regular envelope and shipped I do my Hash orders this way because the hash is soft and you can flatten it completely so no GENIUS STEALTH needed just a dam stamp and common sense
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will be a little worried when I order my KILO of Black Hash now that will be a treat

    we do teh same with small hash order and also the bigger ones.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One question here..how to get it softer the best way?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because we have many such orders and sometimes it is a pain in the ass to flatten them a partner suggested putting it into the microwave for just a few seconds...we tried that and it is really great but we want to make sure there is no THC lost or smth similar before we ship such hash.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any suggestions?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers!

    I agree with others on this. I have a business and a postal box to ship to so I never have to sign, and I have the added bonus that I can received stuff from certain countries and it doesn't look out of place or suspicious, unless the item is packaged poorly but especially when ordering internationally, I have been keeping it to one certain vendor who's packing methods rock the house, has good prices and products and his stuff comes almost like clockwork. 9-10 working days almost everytime. Never been disappointed by them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now if I lived on a rural route, and had stuff shipped internationally to my name, not my business name, I wouldn't order much, if anything at all. In my opinion unless the packaging was poor, the carrier can be the most dangerous link in the chain. Some carriers will leave anything anywhere as long as the address matches. Some will not deliver mail to addresses if they think the person does not live there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think about it, would you take the time to send a package (letter mail is a little different) to someone and have the totally wrong shipping info. Shipping addresses are off by one digit or something all the time and if the carrier recognizes the name, will deliver to the person's correct address if they see a small error.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can also get of the see through plastic sleeves and a card and list everybody who should receive mail at your address. I have one of those cards because at one point there were like 4 last names all at my house and the names were confusing the carrier. I recommend this as if the person is listed on the card, you can be pretty sure the carrier will deliver it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess I went a bit off topic but bottom line is business + metro area + good vendor = safe
    <br/>
    To person's name + house + poor vendor = not so safe, multiply by rural address and = even less safe
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my opinion
