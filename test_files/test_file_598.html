    I've noticed a lot of vendors quote quite long shipping times internationally and have seen plenty of people speak of 20-40 day wait times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had the following experience the past December and I'm curious what comments people have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It took me about a month (I'm slow) to figure out how to set everything up to place an order, buy bitcoins and get them transferred into my SR wallet and then get comfortable enough to place some orders. In my area (somewhere in Asia) it's almost impossible to get good MDMA (my drug of choice) and I've had a number of bad experiences buying stuff marketed as MDMA but was obviously not to an experienced user.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We had wanted to get some gear for the last new years and in investigating shipping times I was worried that if I only ordered form one Vendor it would not arrive in time. To try and solve this dilemma I decided to place three orders on December 2nd (Sunday - note that I'm ahead of Euro TZ) and I had the following results.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1 order to a vendor based in Germany - extremely well respected SR vendor - order was received on 3 Jan 2013 but was posted on 12 December 2012.
    <br/>
    1 order to a vendor based in Europe - extremely well respected SR vendor - order was received on 2 Jan 2013 but was posted on 10 December 2012.
    <br/>
    1 order to a vendor based in NL - little known vendor not very active - order was received on 10 Dec 2013 and posted on 3 December 2012.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was a little annoyed at the NL vendor because their location was not made clear. However, they posted immediately and if I hadn't placed it with them my NYE would have been drug free :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, I'm not complaining as such. We're dealing in a black market after all and all orders made it to me which is the main thing. I'm just curious if others actually pay attention to the date stamps on their packages and if the times people quote are "real" or factor in delays that vendors have in actually posting the product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note that I will be ordering from both the first two vendors again for sure. Quality packaging and product. I will not be disclosing names as that's not the purpose of this thread.

    I'd be extremely pissed off if i placed an order on the 2nd and it wasn't shipped until the 10th or the 12th, and I certainly wouldn't place any further orders with them. When were they marked "in transit"?

    The big sellers receive hundreds of orders a day and have backlogs as a consequence (before they eventually go to shit/rogue). Not easy to ship hundreds of packages a day discretely, some even have to have them taken across borders first. They could turn away business, but would you?

    The one for the 12th I do not understand but the one shipped on the 10th
    <br/>
    I look at like this
    <br/>
    .You placed order on a Monday ( give the vendor benefit say late day.)
    <br/>
    Tues order gets noticed give 3 days to pack and process ( fair time... its now sat.     Mon is the 10th. after that it is all mail
    <br/>
    This does suck as with Christmas every day waited adds 2-3 days delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF you do not live in a major center then you have to expect more time for simple steps to protect privacy

    I know all about the logistics :)
    <br/>
    One of the reasons so many big vendors go to shit is because they take more orders than they can ship and the backlog quickly becomes too much to cope with, it's pointless taking 200 orders per day if you can only ship 100.

    I don't get it... The vendor from the NL got your package in the mail within a day of your order (a full week before the other two vendors) but you are only sure you will be ordering from the other two again? NL vendor's package arrived a full 3 weeks before the other two. Why not continue to support his business?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As a vendor I pay very close attention to processing times. I already have the product and the packing materials. I am going to have to do the work of packaging and shipping eventually anyways... why not just get it in the mail within 24 hrs? Additionally, every extra day I take to ship is an extra day before my bitcoins are released from escrow.

    True. These vendors would do best for themselves and their customers if they raised prices when the demand exceeds what they can supply. It would slow down their orders while increasing their profits. Once they expand their capabilities then they can again lower prices to increase their volume.
