    Cut a long story short should have received a package on friday but my friend was in the shower when delivery was attempted and the package was taken to the post office. Went in there this morning and after taking an age looking for the package they said it was taken to another post office, called up that post office and they said they didn't have it  :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I enter the tracking number it claims the package is still at the post office where we went this morning but they claim it isn't there  &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm reluctant to call parcel force and find it it's exact location in case they record me or my friend gets into trouble
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any advice guys?

    If they discovered drugs in it they would of had you pick it up and accept delivery before busting you red handed. I think they may have genuinely lost it. Keep on them to find it.  ;D
