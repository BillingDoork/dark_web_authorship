    Hey people,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know this has probably been asked before, but I'd just check again with all of you. Really appreciate it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am going to the UK very shortly flying from another country in the EU, and I've put 6 capsules of 4-AcO-DMT with 2 x 14mg and 4 x 20mg in a bottle of N-acetylcysteine that looks like this: http://www.luckyvitamin.com/images/product/xlarge/66404.jpg
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I took out the N-acetylcysteine, put in the 4-AcO-DMT powder and filled the rest up with Piracetam. It is noticeable if you look very carefully at all the capsules if you take them out of the bottle, but otherwise they look pretty much the same.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thing is, this trip means a lot to me, and I wanted to make sure that this was the best way to do it; if this is a bad method, please let me know so I can either drop this whole ordeal or come up with a better way of doing. I really, really don't want to risk not getting to see my girlfriend because of this, but she's been wanting to trip forever and the place we're going has absolutely amazing scenery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This supplement bottle is going in my hold luggage with all my clothes and I also brought a bottle of D-vitamin so it doesn't seem suspicious that I am only bringing one supplement. Is it likely that dogs are trained to sniff out research chemicals nowadays? Would they open the bottle to check what's in it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe I'm just being overly cautious and paranoid, but I'd really appreciate any kind of advice on whether or not this is worth it, and if it is a substantial risk. Please let me know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you guys so much, really appreciate it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best wishes,

    your gonna be fine mate, much bigger fish to fry
    <br/>
    uk airports are busy atm, and your laughin if your at gatwick/heathrow
    <br/>
    even if they find your lil stash him sure they wont, your likely to get a slap on the wrist
    <br/>
    i know a couple of my pals, just came back from dam with about 14 grams each (of bud) and they were given a caution and sent on their way
    <br/>
    dont take this as gospel, but airport security are para about the olympic game threats
    <br/>
    so a small personal amount of drugs isnt worth the time and manpower to them atm

    You can always take a small amount of a beta blocker (Long as you don't have any health issues like asthma, heart, etc).....will keep you calm even if questioned.  It seems they wouldn't even be able to test for that stuff......so really the only person that can get you busted is you.

    You could always post the items ahead of time and therefore mitigate the risk of going thru airport customs, just an idea...
