    Hi all,
    <br/>
    Fairly new vendor here with kinda a newb question: I've started out by selling smaller quantities and have my stealth down to a science. However, I have been shipping using small priority boxes and blue drop boxes. If I move to start selling larger quantities that I do not think will fit into the small boxes how should I go about this? They have the larger priority boxes but I don't believe I will be able to use the drop boxes in this case.
    <br/>
    Thanks for any help  :)

    Do you think you can fit more stuff in a fat bubble mailer and then in a priority padded envelope  If not just get a bigger priority box, weed vendors use big boxes all the time.

    Thank Yousaf, Do you or anyone else have advice on how to drop the bigger boxes? I think your envelope idea would fit but I would much rather have the protection of a box.

    Thanks again :)

    There is a 13 oz rule with USPS, if your package is over 13 oz in weight you have to take it to the counter and ship it with cash, obviously park far as fuck away in a residential street.  If it is under 13 oz in weight and you have to use the box then you can drop it in a blue USPS box.

    What he said. Now if your item weights over 13oz you need to break up the shipment. The issue is it is no longer winter and if you bring a item to a office you will handle it! ok so thats finger prints, once again sssuuurreee you can dip your finger tips in superglue/acetone method but for me i say fuck that. You could also break down the order into two shipments or more, just use a diff return each time due to the whole "we scan to&amp;from" bullshit.

    Domestic bulk is more of a pain in the ass then international, believe it or not...its a joke if you ask me.
