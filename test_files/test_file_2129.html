    I'm in the US, so this doesn't directly concern me. However, for my job we ship a lot of packages to Brazil. I don't know the details, but there has been talk at my company about this. It seems increased inspection processes have delayed parcels a bunch. As this doesn't apply to me it's not a big deal but I'm wondering how this is effecting our comrades down in Brazil, if anybody cares to post?? Here is a clearnet article I found on it ( http://www.hktdc.com/info/vp/a/emk/en/1/2/1/1X07VZFO/Brazil-Steps-Up-Efforts-To-Ensure-Imports-Comply-With-All-Applicable-Requirements.htm )

    I don't think this is an issue with small orders like 1oz or 2oz maximum because most of them come as normal letters and does not look like products bought online. I just ordered 1 oz of weed and one sample of MD and it came safely and fast to my house in SÃ£o Paulo / Brazil.
    <br/>
    In my opinion this concerns importations of products bought legally online like Electronics/Toys/Clothes because the brazillian law it's not very friendly with buying those types of products online and they tax it alot to make people less comfortable with importing products.
