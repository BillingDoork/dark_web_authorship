    Just wondering if anyone has experienced a controlled delivery or known any one who has?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am getting a pretty decent amount shipped of bud to my house weekly, and the signature is waived, so if they do ask me to sign, I just check return to sender. Also, it leaves the delivery house within 1-2 hours unopened in the box. So do you guys think this is fail proof? I live in a area that is not busy and no neighbors are home during the day, so any unusual cars will be noticed by me. The delivery house is also always kept clean.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was also thinking about giving up smoking weed so if anything does get caught, I can say "I don't even smoke that shit, why would I get it shipped to my house?"  ;D
    <br/>
    I really don't wanna give up smoking but if not smoking it keeps peace in my mind, I don't need it! (I'm probably thinking to  much into this, but it's never a bad thing.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All in all, I wanna make some cash the easiest and safest way possible, and if this isn't going to work, I'll drop it and start up something else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other precautions I should take? Anyone have prior experience with this?

    I am extremely surprised there has been no replies to this? Not that I can offer any experiances or advice, but i recieved a letter on monday to pick up my package from my normal local post office which i usually do with things from ebay and such, but i thought tabs (1000) would fit in a normal envelope? anywho i may collect it tomorrow but i just saw what u said about not collecting packages if u sign for it :)

    Mate there have been no replies to it because it is ridiculous, AND the reasons it is ridiculous are stated clearly in other posts in this forum by actual postal workers who are also users of SR.,
    <br/>
    Controlled deliveries are usually a US thing, and if both of you guys go and read up on it elsewhere in the forum where actual USPS workers have posted you will both see you have more chance of winning the lottery than getting busted in a controlled delivery, cos they are tiresome to set up and you need to be a serious criminal to warrant that kind of tiresomeness.
    <br/>
    As for the Aussie cops they are too busy with bushfire evacuations and drink drivers to worry about your post!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also got a bunch of tabs from tyler today, i'm not going to discuss packaging, but think of it this way, tabs are in fact blotters, blotters are paper (blotting paper like your Pop had on his desk before PCs) so the 'package' is going to not be a 'package at all, do you get my drift? You're probably only signing because its been sent from the UK recorded delivery so that Tyler can prove he sent it from his end in case of a dispute. Remember, in every respect, the mailing of this SR items is done exactly the same way as any legit item of value, to do it any other way is exactly how to raise a red flag on your shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think you are worrying over nothing at all, i have had deliveries on SR for a year, from US EU UK signed, unsigned, big packages small packages, you name it, never got lost, never got a love letter from customs. go get your tabs, and enjoy! (And hows about a karma + for setting your mind at ease, and showing you how it works would be nice, bro)

    This post made my day. I've been lurking around here a while and this is my first time posting. Recently made my first purchase off SR, and this has me feeling a lot better!
