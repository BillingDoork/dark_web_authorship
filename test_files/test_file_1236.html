    Well many reliable good vendors on SR and outside of sr have used this not saying it works or not, but was just wondering were i can obtain some..... Anyways i have another shipping question if any of YOU could possibly help me out.. I have a regular letter envelope that weighs 1oz its not rigid or anything just has a few letters i wanna send in it; Like three computer papers in it with a letter i need to send to my GF was wondering how much this would cost to send first class mail i was thinking 44cents , one stamp? Please let me know if i am wrong thanks :)

    weigh it at home or take it to the scale they have in the lobby, that will tell you. At least my PO has a public scale in the lobby that tells you the weight and the rate and has a stamp machine right next to it. And the slot for the outgoing mail is in the wall next to the po boxes. i do all my mailing after hours.
