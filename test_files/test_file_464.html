    Okay, so according to tracking it's at the last step... processed at the sorting facility and departed about about 3am last night. The facility is located in the capital of my state and is a 30 minute drive from there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The expected delivery date is today. I thought it would definitely be here since it left the capital facility, which is usually the last step from what I remember from other tracked packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes vans deliver priority mail, so I'm hoping that's the case today... fuck.

    God DAMN this is exactly why you don't tell custys that you're getting product when tracking says you are.

    Fuck you Santa, delaying my shit... &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: My mistake, now I remember more clearly. I think it's supposed to say Arrival at Post Office in the city I'm in. Meh, maybe I'll be lucky and the tracking is just slow. Gotta stay optimistic. :P

    HP? 7th day? God bless you and your patience. I'm just waiting on a zip of bud. It was sent out on the 19th from the opposite side of the country, arrived in my state today. Pretty fast for the holiday season IMO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's a domestic order then I can almost guarantee you'll get it by Christmas. If you don't mind me asking, who did you order from? I'm guessing tastEtrEats. If so then I'm pretty sure he's got your back. I've only ordered once from him, but it was one of the best transactions I've ever had on SR.

    I'm sort of in the same boat you are, except I ordered something express. I was sure it would be here today, but it didn't come in this morning.

    Would not be that worried today personally.
    <br/>
    Sometimes I feel like they scan packages and it gets caught up not getting delivered. One time I had an order delayed over a week due to weather problems. I was paranoid as hell lol. Thought it was an absurd amount of time and that something went wrong. Tracking said "out for delivery" ...hours went by and nothing. It ended up not coming that day. Checked the tracking a little later on and it said "notice left". I said oh shit ok somethings funky, now I need to go into the PO and sign the notice? Turns out they scanned it out for delivery, didn't make it that day so they must of put "notice left". Just came the very next day no problems!
    <br/>
    But man was that a terrible week and a half haha. Didn't know what was going on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Point being though, even if it's close by I'd at least give it a day or two more (a day no sweat). After Monday I would start to get serious.

    Don't worry if it doesn't come today, read the thread that Flylo linked us to earlier. If mailed by Saturday, it'll definitely arrive by Christmas.

    Who was it from? I hear that a couple popular weed vendors sell express, but end up sending in priority. Doesn't seem like a huge deal, but I'd be a little upset if I ordered express and got priority instead. If I'm paying for express, that means it's very urgent and I really WANT (dare I say need?) it asap.

    Good news, my order did get to my post office today! It was delayed in transit a bit because of all the problems USPS is having. Luckily my awesome vendor had shipped it out right after I ordered! It was an express package that was shipped late Tuesday night, and got to my post office Friday afternoon. I live in a rural area and express usually takes 2 days, but it is usually here by the morning of the 2nd day, so there definitely are delays right now. My small town post office was slammed with mail, so there are probably just lots of delays right now. So don't panic! Also, I don't know how other peoples post offices work, but for some of them, there is a truck at the end of the day that brings more packages to the post office, but those packages don't get delivered to your mailbox until the next day since that last truck comes after the mailperson has made their rounds.

    Well I don't want to put the vendor out there like that because they did help me out by not making me pay the SR fee and since I had to just deposit the money into his account he overnighted it because of his policy of if you FE he overnights. So it's not like I paid for overnight but I would like to know when things are going to get here just so I don't make empty promises to my customers.
