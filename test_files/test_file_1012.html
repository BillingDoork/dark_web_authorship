    So, I've been reading about how some people attempt to use fake names and reasons why it is good and not. The main reason is that the packages could get flagged if it is the first package shipped to an individual name in a household.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I decided that it could be a good idea to start having items shipped to my house under a fake name of a person who does not exist. I have ordered a large number of free items from various places and I am assuming that after having all of these useless trinkets delivered, the post office will just assume everything is in order. I know this does not eliminate a lot of the risk involved in shipping to a fake person, but it should resolve some.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My main questions are as follows:
    <br/>
    1) Could I get in legal trouble for fraud or something of the sort if LE thinks I have made up the name myself?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) Would I get in trouble there was evidence of having opened packages sent to this person previously under the pretense that they kept coming and I didn't want to throw them away?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3) Could having the item shipped to this fictional person actually help me in court if I am the target of a controlled delivery/stake out? Legal proceedings?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4) Are there any unforeseen troubles that this fake name could have for me?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, if LE did get a warrant and search for my house they would have a hard time finding anything, and the substances that I do have (mostly class I) are in very low quantity, if it even matters.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At this point I will pretty much have an alternate shipping name for spam even if I don't use it for the road, but I was wondering if you guys think this is a good idea or bad idea. If it's a bad idea, why?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance for the insight!

    I know everyone says use your real name, but this idea just seems too good.

    I don't think this is a good idea simply because you are having things shipped to your house. If they find the drugs it just makes it look worse if they are addressed to a fake name, not very plausible deniability. If you did the same thing to a P.O. box it would be better, but that's assuming you don't just stroll in and collect a hot package.
