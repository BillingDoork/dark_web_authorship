    is it possible to buy the $1+ stamps and put 5-6 on a box to ship something so you dont have to walk into the post office or is that suspicious? I have seen people from Europe do it. is that an option in the usa if a pakadge costs $5.60 can we just put 6 stamps on there ? (im not sure if they make more expensive ones than $1) Automated machine is out as you need a CC that can be linked to you plus you still have to walk into the office to use it.

    Sure you can if you want to get busted.
    <br/>
    I've seen mail get flagged for being suspicious. If your box is over the 13oz it WILL be flagged, especially if there are multiples.
    <br/>
    The postal inspector will open it and they will pull video feed from cameras that watch the boxes, next thing you know you have DEA kicking in your front door tearing your house apart.
    <br/>
    Think it's far fetched? It's not, it's happened many times to many people and recently to a good friend of mine.
    <br/>
    DON'T use this method unless you're sending envelopes

    they make 5.60$ priority stamps...
    <br/>
    then add a 20 cent stamp and ship small box..
    <br/>
    keep under 13 oz limit..
    <br/>
    no problems.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    no reason to overpay your postage its already expensive enough.

    There are some P.O.'s with 24 hour postage vending machines/parcel drop boxes, and I'm pretty sure not all of them have camera's. you can use a prepaid debit card that you paid cash for, so it's not TOTALLY out of the question....

    You gotta understand, half the postal employees don't even know the regulations. The mail sorters are the ones who are a little more aware.
    <br/>
    YES you can use stamps, you can use 580 1cent stamps if you want with a 20lb flat rate package. So long as you bring it to the desk.
    <br/>
    Taking it to the blue box will get it pulled and inspected for hazardous material, it's not hard for them to get warrants to check your mail.
    <br/>
    If you send a package through the blue box over 13oz, there is a chance (not a guarantee) that it will get pulled. If you drop 10 packages with stamps and some of them are over 13oz they will pull all of your packages, flag them, notify DEA and RTS your packages that they open with the contents still in tack. You probably won't hear anything from them for a few weeks but one day you'll be asleep in your bed and BOOM there goes your front door.
    <br/>
    Even if your RTS is different (which it should be) if they're looking for you, they will find you. My buddy got popped by facial recognition, I didn't think they really did that but I guess they do. They had video of him at like 10 different post offices in 3 different states.
    <br/>
    The risk is yours to take, if you're being watched.you will never know it.  Before they started RTSing the packs they were monitoring how many were going out and seeing who they were delivered to. They were smart and they only pulled one pack which was never delivered. They allowed him to send 50+ packages before intercepting more of them and RTSing them. They only returned the ones they opened. The address he used wasn't even close to his own address, he sent from a different state and they busted him at his house (which he just moved in to 2 months earlier that was in his friends name).
    <br/>
    Like I said, the risk is yours to take. Personally, it's not worth the risk to me but I move allot more then most of the SR vendors here.

    WTf is u talkin bout facial recognition, the whole god damn point of using blue boxes is that most of them arent near cameras at all. Sounds like ur buddy didnt understand why he was doing what he was doin, and if he's dropping 10 packages in a box and one of them is over 13 oz and they all look alike then he obviously didnt know wtf he was doing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had to send a bunch of dvds out, like 30 of em, so i bring em in boxes of padded envelopes to the counter and the clerk says he doesnt want to run them all and to buy dollar and quarter stamps and put 3.50 on each. Obviously less stamps= less obvious, and keep it under 13oz, and dont drop a dozen of the same package in a bluebox, all with the same label type and the same sketchy return address.

    <br/>
    So in order to ship a 13+ oz package with stamps, you have to bring it to the front desk at USPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm also unsure of Jonny Bench's post, sounds like fear mongering to me.  You got a news article for your friend ?

    That's not quite right.  It takes two acts of Congress and an act of Horus the Almighty to open mail in the USPS.  Okay, it's not that hard, but it's not that easy, either.  The biggest problem you'll run into with stamping the hell out of a package is being short.  Then, they'll return the package, and I'm not sure if you can just add what's missing or if you have to start over.  Probably the former.  But, if you spend a little money on a postage scale (they sell them at OfficeMax, Staples, etc.), you'll know exactly what the postage is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get why no one want to go inside.  You're worried that if the package is opened, they'll track it back to that PO, use the timestamp to figure out which counter and when, and see your smiling face on the screen.  That's a big "if", though.  If you stick with the ready-made Priority Mail envelopes and boxes, you can't go wrong.  Just don't go over the weight limit.  If you do go over, they'll tell you that before you can mail it.  It's idiot-proof so it can be automated.  And, automation is our friend.
    <br/>

    Just FYI, I hear packages with excessive postage are considered more suspect (just a little more). I think there are $2 stamps and other stamps to make sure you get postage exact. A large priority flat-rate box weighs like 6 ounces (when empty) and may not fit in the opening of some blue boxes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To get tracking you need a #400 sticker added. Tracking is free now (for Priority at least). These can be hard to get at the post office as some postal workers think we should not be allowed to have them. I think they can be ordered online in rolls and that the post offices will be handing them out free and easy when they get used to the new situation. I think there has been an internal shortage of the #400 stickers since the change from the green tracking labels. They were on backorder if you tried to get them online recently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are also other places that  accept USPS mailings. "Mom and pop" places and i think at least one chain of business-supplies stores. The business supply places may require that you input lots of address details into their computer. Mom and pops seem more interesting to investigate.

    I am reposting this in various tracking label threads in case it is true - sorry to be repetitive.-
    <br/>
    I was told recently that the Free tracking on priority mail is only if you buy the postage online or take the package to the counter. She claimed that even if you have the "400 labels" you have to pay $0.90 more postage for tracking if you drop in a blue box with stamps. I'm not even sure she was saying you could add the extra postage as stamps? I don't trust this information although she seemed to think she was an expert on the subject. She gave me a bunch of different bar code labels she said did not add tracking (even though they say "USPS Tracking #" in bold print) but would keep the package moving through their system faster. These labels are not #400 and do not have the little extra strip on the bottom with a copy of the tracking number to keep.

    Yeah, that sounds about like what I've experienced, and I ship a lot of crap on ebay.  The tracking numbers on those labels she gave you won't be live until you take them to a counter and get the labels scanned (which will cost you $0.90).  If you know what you're doing, you can actually register a fake name at usps.com and print your own shipping labels using a prepaid Visa.  If you're doing a lot of shipping, try to buy as big a card as you can, though, because the card will cost you $5 (none of the cards in the US are reloadable unless you give up your SSN, DOB and address - if I'm wrong about that, somebody please let me know).

    Sometimes we forget about the less technologically savvy parts of the USA where the postman uses his old, personal F150 to deliver the mail on back, dirt roads. Nothing is suspicious when it looks normal :). Stamps are normal, BlueBox drops are normal, people asking for the "400 stickers" for their beloved home business are normal. The art of operating as a normal person while keeping anonymity in tack is that indeed, an art.

    edited the quote a bit as I think thats what XXXotica meant. I agree, of course. My point I was making above is that I am told the 400 labels don't work with stamps in the blue boxes anymore.

    If they say no, say thanks and goto the next place. When you find one that works they roll out a red carpet and confetti becuase your buying sheets of stamps. Great service with smiles. If you can't make up a back story you shouldn't be on SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I WOULD NEVER BUY THEM FROM PEOPLE ON THE ROAD. JUST MY OPINION.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I sell ALL type of U$P$ Postage $tamps for BTC :)

    I believe there have been a few assumptions running here.  First most the time it's inferred that the small priority boxes being used are well under the 13 Oz rule.  I personally would not be running that system if I needed to run more than 6 - 8 oz of anything that might fit in those boxes so it wouldn't come close to hitting the 13 Oz limit.  Luckily we never come close.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other assumption that the postal worker was making is because it gets dumped into the blue box, it doesn't get scanned.  Which is partially true, it doesn't get scanned at the counter at the very beginning, but as it continues it journey, it will get scanned several times.

     Even if your RTS is different (which it should be) if they're looking for you, they will find you. My buddy got popped by facial recognition, I didn't think they really did that but I guess they do. They had video of him at like 10 different post offices in 3 different states.
     <br/>
     The risk is yours to take, if you're being watched.you will never know it.  Before they started RTSing the packs they were monitoring how many were going out and seeing who they were delivered to. They were smart and they only pulled one pack which was never delivered. They allowed him to send 50+ packages before intercepting more of them and RTSing them. They only returned the ones they opened. The address he used wasn't even close to his own address, he sent from a different state and they busted him at his house (which he just moved in to 2 months earlier that was in his friends name).
     <br/>
     Like I said, the risk is yours to take. Personally, it's not worth the risk to me but I move allot more then most of the SR vendors here.

    So you're claiming they matched your buddy dropping packages into the blue box with the stamps he bought... from facial recognition of video of him purchasing the stamps.  Yeah, ok. lol

    Yes, I am referring to packages under the 13oz rule, I am sure she knew the packages would be scanned - she was like the older manager-type who seemed very knowledgeable. She even gave me a roll of labels for scanning on the packages that she claimed would not provide tracking for me, but would help the package get scanned and moving. She implied packages without scan-able bar-codes would be on a back burner if she was busy until she had a chance to add a barcode to the package.

      If you send a package through the blue box over 13oz, there is a chance (not a guarantee) that it will get pulled.

    Unlike television getting a warrant is really just a matter of filling out a form with any bullshit excuse and then getting it signed by the appropriate person in the judicial system.  Just keep the package under 13oz.  Why break a simple rule like that when you're shipping illegal substances?  Pay the extra money for 2 small flat-rate priority boxes instead of one.

    Yes  you could use several $1 stamps for priority mail, but if you might as well just save yourself some time and buy the $5.60 priority mail stamps and add the additional stamps depending on which priority packaging you are using if you plan on shipping priority frequently. You can actually even use a few priority mail stamps on an express mail package too....just as long as you've got the right amount of money's worth of stamps on there...they'll ship it.

    Also, concerning postal incompetence, last week I was trying to buy priority stamps at the counter and the guy had no clue.

Finally I got him to flip through the book and I ended up purchasing a couple sheets of $1 stamps. He was clueless though.

    Amazingly enough there are a number of new counter postal workers of late, not sure if they are hiring, or sending up through the ranks, but have been hearing about a number of newer clerks that know very little past basic info.

    The people at the top at USPS aren't good at passing information down.  Before the recent rate increases I asked the postal clerks at the counter about the new rates and they said they would have to check the USPS website to find out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS has been bad about spreading information about the tracking labels in particular.  It seems clear to me that some federal agency is pressuring USPS (eg 13oz rule, tracking labels that must be ordered, etc) to make mail less anonymous.  I suspect that eventually they'll try and get rid of traditional stamps altogether for packages.

      They are resistant to giving out the #400s and maybe she was lying to keep me from wanting them. Does not seem too likely though.

     I've certainly had a hard time getting the 400's. Why is everyone so resistant to giving them out? Is being unhelpful strict usps policy
     <br/>
     Also, concerning postal incompetence, last week I was trying to buy priority stamps at the counter and the guy had no clue. He kept handing me 42 cent stamps, and I'm like 'Don't you have any stamps with more postage on them?' and he looks at me like I'm crazy. Finally I got him to flip through the book and I ended up purchasing a couple sheets of $1 stamps. He was clueless though.

    I agree, getting them definitely isnt easy. More of a task than anything but just come off as professional as possible. Make them realize that you know exactly what your talking about and they will start to second guess themselves. Once the person starts second guessing themselves youll have them in the palm of your hand, shoving "400" labels down your pocket!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously though, just be as professional as possible as well as friendly and youll be able to get them pretty easily. Believe or not a manager at one of the postal location flat out told me that they were instructed to NEVER hand them over to patrons. She said they are supposed to physically put it on themselves for every item. It is definitely an intense security measure that I personally believe was solely made to better identify drug/ cash through the mail system.

    Guess what i just got in the mail? Yep, a pack of #400 dcn forms. I realize they probably are registered to my address so i can't use them for illicit stuff but they will come in handy for shipment that aren't illegal and which i would like tracking but do not want to go down to the fucking post office every time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they are handing them out to customers then it won't be long before they are in the po for anyone to grab. That's what we all hope anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A second possibility is to buy or trade them with others. Long as you are trading with someone legit it should work, right?

    Not necessarily. If they know who bought a series of numbered labels, then if any get into trouble, they can try to get the buyer to roll over and all the labels they bought are linked for potential high scrutiny.
    <br/>
    So, even if you use fake ID and an anonymous Visa to buy postage online, I would not use the same card or identity to buy huge amounts of stickers for yourself or to sell to others. If I'm right,  the same goes for buying postage online.
    <br/>
    Hopefully I'm not just over paranoid and fear-mongering unintentionally.
