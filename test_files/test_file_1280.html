    The links given at the stickie post at the top of this page don't have any for sale...there are some clearnet sites but I prefer to buy from SR vendors who have found the right stuff...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't want the foil type just the clear mbb...is it available in bags or or sheets...?...reason I don't want foil is because of x-ray...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts appreciated...

    I believe these are the foil type, although I am not sure what kind of mylar/mbb is clear. Never seen those before

    thats why packages are always kept small.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you dont see vendors sending an 8 ball inside of a microwave or an Exuast pipe. something that size is usaully x rayd.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also not going into detail over forum- always uses a fake invoice- fake receipt-
    <br/>
    <br/>
    some vendors stealth will literallyÂ  be opened, inspected, and passed, through customs.

    They're not radio-opaque (or would probably be specified as such) so far as I know.
    <br/>
    Thick metals are the issue. The mylarized coffee bags I've sent through in my carry-ons have looked like a normal 'mixed' item when I've asked what they look like.
    <br/>
    Links break; this is easily referenced.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MBB/OBB sources to consider: Food prepper or food storage sites, many of which have been sympathetic to anonymized payments/addresses and are not in the big Amazonplex.
    <br/>
    Retort canning suppliers. Expensive though at the home rate. Sous vide cooking uses these sometimes - same thing.
    <br/>
    Food packaging supply companies: cheap, bulk. Lots of people out there making little crafty teas or soup mixes or whatever and selling them, or packaging gift bags of coffee/cocoa, or promo giftie bags. Make sure coffee bags do NOT have a CO2 gas vent. Bags that can contain the smell of fish, wine, cinnamon, etc: good bet.
    <br/>
    Lab and med supply companies.
    <br/>
    Electronics shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lots of clear or clear-windowed moisture/odor barrier bags out there too - go look around the pet-treats aisle, for example. You'll notice you're not assaulted with the odor of pseudo-bacon.
