    So I've been trying to locate a package, all of my packages from the same place, shipped to the same location around the same date only show delivery date when I look up their tracking.
    <br/>
    but this other pack shows a name that I don't know. I called the box where it went and there is no one there with that name that works there. There was no slip in the box either.
    <br/>
    Any ideas?

    Likelihood of being stolen?  The only other time I've heard of a signature confirmation results not being as expected was when it was a controlled delivery, and that time the tracking said something like 'signature waived'.

    Well the thing is, it went to a UPS box under a false identity. Nothing near the name that was on the signature delivery confirmation that comes up digitally on usps tracking site

    This it's possible that it was intercepted by a postal inspector?
    <br/>
    Don't think they would sign for it like that though.
    <br/>
    It shows it made it to the delivery office at usps then the next day showed delivered at the location but like i said, no one with that name works there.

    Now it sounds stolen.  Maybe by the staff there?

    really it could have been anyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if it was staff, im sure they would just make up a random name and sign for it
