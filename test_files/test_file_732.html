    Hey guys, I've been looking for a secure way to receive bulk amounts from the UK to Aus without having to have my real name and address on the parcel (pretty sure my name and address is flagged). I'm now looking into P.O Boxes. So say I give the vendor my P.O Box number and such, when the parcel goes through customs and the P.O Box gets scanned or some shit like that will my real name and address come up? Or do customs have to ask AusPost for the name and address of the person renting the P.O Box? If someone who uses an AusPost P.O Box sees this could they just inform me of any little nuts and bolts of ordering from O/S using a P.O Box even if they don't know the answer to my question.

    I would tread very carefully....Whenever I see the words 'bulk' and 'Australia' in the same sentence I always laugh. The reason why our domestic prices are high, is because it is hard to smuggle narcotics past our borders, this no doubt you already know. Bringing in 'bulk' would require some sophisticated planning which by the looks of it, you have not done.

    In America, postal address' are linked with names, but in Australia they are not, once your parcel has passed customs Aus Post/courier company will most likely scan the tracking bar code so the tracking is updated for the buyer, but names shouldn't pop up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless if you've got Dick Head or John Citizen on the parcel, if it is taken for further inspection and contraband is found then no matter what name is on the front it is redundant. The person who goes to collect that package will be under scrutiny/possible investigation. Considering its bulk, I'd bet you will get more than a customs letter....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I believe fake PO boxes give a false sense of security, if authorities have identified contraband in envelopes they can simply leave a 'please collect' slip and nab the offender at collection. Using a false name on a package is unlikely to work as most require photo I.D upon collection. You could purchase a fake I.D but then your just adding more charges to your name if the worst were to happen. If I was you I would scrap this whole idea altogether. Do a little more reading, and perhaps start with some smaller shipments testing alternative methods other than PO Boxes, before ordering your 5000KG's of mdma.

    contrary to the popular opinion on this forum aus customs arent some magical entity and it would depend on your definition of bulk whether it would be a problem or not.

    Do you honestly someone on here is going to know the full customs protocol??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should delete this thread immediately, as you are attracting unnecessary attention with your KEY WORDS.
    <br/>
    What difference is it if you say bulk, or making an order. or UK or overseas. You will stil most likely get the same information, but without just waving a flag at for which country for LE to now MONITOR and which Addresses (PO BOX) to Look out for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Smarten the fuck up
    <br/>
    You should just include your full name and address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Theres been alot of aussie threads, that you obviously havent read, and most of them end the same way with everyone telling you to delete the thread and to stop attracting attention

    No they do not cross reference names with packages otherwise I would not get a delivery.
    <br/>
    This has been posted a few times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I do agree that aus customs is not magical however I do recognize that AQIS is semi serious in detecting pest and disease that come in through the mail.
    <br/>
    It is not just luck that we are relatively free of the devastating diseases and pests that plague most other countries agricultural and primary industries.
    <br/>
    Drugs just get caught up in it all.
    <br/>
    Countries that are not so serious about what gets in have relatively relaxed customs

    Oh good another AU specific thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Go and read the other threads where this has been discussed to DEATH.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm locking this to kill it before any more know all know nothings start to comment on shit they actually know fuck all about (no offense to those who already commented by the way, Capz you gave good advise.)
