    If your just talking about the tracking then yea. That is very normal. Example is last week I was waiting on stock from US which had been stuck for over a week. It was finally updated to "ready for international dispatch" (the stage before customs) after being "stuck" - It arrived the next day. It would be hard to design a system which works this poorly. Don't stress unless it's stuck in customs.

    I too have seen that. Particularly registered/tracked from Spain to US. - You may the Spain Poste tracking number on USPS.com, however  they made it "appear" as if it moved from Spain to Madrid, and was being held from a Thursday to the following TUESDAY! Once I got it Tuesday morning I decided to see if the  tracking had been "updated" to reflect where this little parcel of poison was.

    Well, it arrived at JFK Airport (NYC) on Friday, stayed there until Monday, where it went 100 miles away to my small town.Then it was delivered to me in the morning.

    The fact that you can actually "track" it and "see" where it is.. Should be enough solace. The next point it get hits with a scanner at, should generate new info, usually within 24 hours.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once you get it, go back and look at the "real story", and I'll bet you see a similar 'gap' where it was like suspended in limbo for no reason.

    Sad. Service has gotten so bad. So this is progress?  :-\ (I'm sure you're getting it) ;)

    Yeah its sitting in the middle of the US midwest I doubt theres customs there. It is lame how bad the service has become, no wonder the postal service is going bankrupt. Thanks for the reassurance.
