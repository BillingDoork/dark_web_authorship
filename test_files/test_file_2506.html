    If you don't want to spend the time to learn then this is not a good place for you to purchase from. Members will help you but not spoon feed you

    Mate, that's not how it works. You setting yourself up to make mistakes which could potentially unmask yourself to anyone looking. Doing this "correctly" is a lot more complex than using Facebook or Youtube. Take the time to read, read, read and read again the mountain of information which can be found here. The "Quick fix" theory won't work on here. We all had to start at some stage and I was given the same advise when I joined, which is to educate yourself and don't be lazy regarding looking for information.

    if you can't figure that out, you need to learn to use google. Don't forget BTC is a market with buyers and sellers and you won't get the conversion rate listed as the mid rate just like when you go to exchange money before a holiday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also in the UK it is increasingly hard to buy BTC, the banks are pulling support for the BTC web sites that previously supported UK customers by allowing them to walk in and make cash deposits to a numbered account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I lurked using google and reading the wiki and forum posts for weeks before being confident enough to take any actions.

    Being "desperate" is a quick way to stuff up.

    Buying bitcoins from a vendor on SR is sheer lunacy. I'll never understand why buyer's do it. I guess it's human nature in some respects, where people will always try to minimize their workload and look for an easy way out where possible. Using the Bitcoin currency can be a much slower and deliberate process compared with using traditional methods such as cash and cards but at the moment, that's how it is.
    <br/>
    It seems there are still people willing to jump in head first to a potentially life changing situation without taking some time to learn how it all works and more importantly, stay safe and protect your anonymity from "prying eyes".
