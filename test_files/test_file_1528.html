    I have a mailbox at some chain service. It is under my real name and I accept all my mail there, bills, amazon, etc. Because I live with others I would never order my SR products to my home as it would be putting them at risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I wanted to order a few Oz. of weed and some prescription meds to that address, how would it all go down if they decided to CD me?
    <br/>
    Because I wouldn't be there to sign, I imagine they would put a tracking device in the package and when I open it raid me wherever I open it at.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But then after they do that... What sort of case would they have against me?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't leave a trace on my computer and there is nothing in my house. But my ISP does know I use TOR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my question is, what will the FE do in a case like this, what would they go through to catch me and when they nab me what type of case would they have against me?

    A tracking device sounds pretty high tech for a drug-buyer bust IMHO.Â  If the (edited) PO Box (/edited) has your real name, and a CD is on the way, the already know where you live and they'll do it there. It's not hard to find someone's address if you're the LEO.
