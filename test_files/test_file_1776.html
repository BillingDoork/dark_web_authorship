    I recently moved to a place where weed is both better and cheaper than where I'm from.  What is the best way to pay for flat rate boxes without them being traced to you?  Can you pay the shipping in cash before packing the boxes and then drop them in a blue box?  How about using stamps on them?  Tracking isnt really an issue, as I would be sending to known associates.

    Thanks for any help, and feel free to PM if deemed necessary.

    You can buy 5.60 stamps at the counter, ask for priority stamps, then add a 20 cent or more stamp for the flat rate boxes which are 5.80 to ship

    Flat Rate boxes are free.  The only way to ship them anonymously is to use postage stamps and drop boxes.  Tracking can become an important issue regardless of how well you know the addressee(as in packages lost or missent while in the system)but that's up to you and your  buyers.  You can just as easily  place your own tracking labels onto flat rates providing you have them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, before dropping stamped boxes be sure to educate yourself on the PO's 13 Ounce Rule.
