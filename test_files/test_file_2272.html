    if you're a buyer, I would strongly advise against ordering illegal drugs to malaysia, youÂ  can get death penalty for that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    or at least, that's what the airplane pilot told us, upon landing in Kuala Lumpur. "make sure you don't have any illegal drugs on yourself...you could face death penalty" or something like that. I remember searching quite intensely my pockets for any remains of old weed...

    Honestly, I'd be scared to get any drugs shipped to me if living in that country. But to answer your question, you should be good to go as long as you choose a reputable vendor and your mail service doesn't fuck up.
