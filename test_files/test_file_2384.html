    Don't know what to tell you brother. This is a very broad question;
    <br/>
    Is crossing the street safe? If you hold your mom's hand it should be.
    <br/>
    Is ordering illegal drugs online without your mom safe? Probably not. But if you take a chance like thousands of other people here who have, you will probably just receive a bag of weed in the mail.
    <br/>
    The question you really ought to ask is "What is my risk tolerance if I get caught?" Will they throw you in jail, torture you, execute you, or just fine you. I dunno the Israeli laws, postal security or tolerance factor.
    <br/>
    What does your mom think?

    Those people who order aren't from Israel maybe in Israel Its less safe then other country's because we have problems with the Arabs and shit so the mail is checked more carefully
    <br/>
    this is why I'm asking if its safe to order to Israel....

    This I cannot help you with. You should re-title your thread "Shipping to Israel, anyone here have complications?"  Your thread title is very general.

    What are the laws for weed in your country? You should at least know this... If it's not a big deal (just a fine for small-ish amounts) then let it rock. As was mentioned, if it's a more corporal punishment... well, you're call. What about the mail? Would receiving [and getting caught with] weed in the mail be a major deal or can you pull a 'it wasn't me' and be out a few bucks?  These really shouldn't be very difficult questions to answer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alternatively, change the title of your thread as was mentioned - this way a vendor who has shipped to your country will have a better chance of seeing it and responding.
