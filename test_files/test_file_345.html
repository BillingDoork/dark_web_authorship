    i told my mom i was shipping her something for the house to her, unfortunately i also have my SR packages sent to her house to avoid incriminating myself at my personal address.  Well, when my MDMA arrived, fortunately (thank gawd) the vendor had concealed it in something unsuspecting, because my mom had ripped open my package thinking it was the one i told her i might be shipping, (but i think she was just being snoopy), but all she saw was a box of matches...... so to all you vendors just wrapping your shit in paper or not at all, please take the extra step to conceal in something that disguises, as it may save someones ass someday and keep your customers safe and in the market.

    Telling the forum that your mom could open your packages and call the police about strange return addies sending their children drugs isn't exactly the smartest idea...vendors may steer clear of you if they do research and find this. Most don't sell to kids, but I'm unsure of your age.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stealthing to guard from postal inspection is one thing, but expecting vendors to make it so your product can't be seen even when your parents open it is a bit much. That said, if they are able to do so then fuckin' rad - but that can't be the standard. I'd say you just got very lucky she didn't pull them out wondering why you purchased a box of matches online.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DO NOT SEND DRUGS TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES WITHOUT THE HOMEOWNER'S PERMISSION! Why put your mom at risk? Just do some thinking about it I suppose, it's not my place to tell you what to do.

    i didn't really tell her she could open my my mail, but that i might be sending her a package, it was just kind of unfortunately coincidental accidental invasion of privacy.  i cant get into why i do it this way, i'm just trying to help everyone stay safe and private and prevent future invasions of privacy and protection of SR's client base. Use your imagination. Take that extra step, protect your customers, because without them SR is nothing.  :)

    This thread is a shame for 2 reasons;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I assume this guy is underage
    <br/>
    His mother has no idea he's sending drugs to her yard
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know for a fact when I was younger if I even had some cigarettes sent to my moms yard I'd get my head busted in with a golf club.

    She may not get sentenced, but that's not quite what I meant anyways. She would get arrested and questioned and held until they knew what was up. It wouldn't be a very fun situation for her, lets put it that way. Stop trying to justify this. Can you do it? yes. Is it right? NO.

    Yeah, lets force a vendor to completely change his method of stealthing a package so we can tell everyone how awesome stealthing packages is... smart one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, the reason why vendors will be more reluctant to sell to you is because there IS a potential for invasion of privacy, regardless of it being unfortunate, coincidental, or otherwise.  Vendor's do not care if "I didn't mean for it to happen," because at the end of the day, if it happens, shit still went wrong.  Intentions are all well and good but contentiousness is an absolute requirement for anything related to illicit trades.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    edit: This post comes off as a bit mean, which is somewhat intentional.
    <br/>
    Your rationale behind this thread is very good.  Your intentions are apparent, you want SR to thrive, and for new vendors to be able to operate without drawing LE attention.  However your methodology for doing so was very poorly thought out.

    I was in two minds about replying to this one but in the end I just had too. I have no idea what you were thinking when you started this thread, to announce to everyone you have your drugs posted to your mums without her knowledge and then complain most vendors do not consider the stealthiness of the INSIDE of the package in case your mum opens it has to be the dumbest thing I have read on here, not to mention detailing packaging techniques.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My only advice would be to PM the vendor in advance of your order and let them know what you are doing so they can do a better job of hiding your shit, even better send them the link to this thread then just wait for them to hit the cancel order button.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Happy shopping.

    Ah, it's 100. I've been wondering. But hey, it's not important, karma only exists IRL.  8)

    yea, we can't wait for the insights you have to share with the community.

    and this shows exactly why i've said this whole karma rating system has been a joke from its conception.  as for my story, the truth always lies somewhere in the middle, but i guess there's no reasoning with idiots.

    <br/>
    now to get back on topic,  its not just parents or mail falling apart that is an issue.  i have had a my mail sent to a neighbors house by mistake at least a couple times in my life, and every time they have opened it thinking it was theirs.  what if my neighbor was a cop or a rat?   children and spouses get curious of packages too.  i assume that most of you arent vendors so this is the reason you could give a shit about the safety of others or getting your customers in trouble.

    From what I can gather in this thread, OP is a kid playing in the big boys world and doesn't quite know how to handle himself yet.  I'm somewhat surprised he has 500+ posts.  Generally people like this will revert to lurking after they get burnt a few times.

    I would respectfully suggest you stop responding to this thread and let it slip in obscurity, you are just digging yourself a deeper hole with every petulant response, there is no way you will salvage anything from this, just leave it alone.

    Point is, it doesn't matter how old he is or if it was his mom. Other people in the house might inadvertently open a package and then see something they weren't supposed to see.

     1.Your an idiot for not making sure your adresse is correct
     <br/>
     2 If it was infact "accidentally" shipped there then its illegal to open other peoples mail and they shouldnt have
     <br/>
     3. IF your neighbor, postie or cop and rat intercepts your parcel then you have no idea what it is. Its called plausible deniability and its everywhere on SR. learn it.

     i'm not forcing any vendor to change their method of shipping.  i just used the box of matches as an example. there never was a fucking box of matches,  i don't even know my mother.  so all you fucking a-holes calling me an idiot need to shut the fuck up, because i'm just trying to demonstrate a scenario so buyers don't abstain from using the road just because some lazy pothead vendor wants to take the easy way out and ship just a airlocked baggie in plain sight.  protect your fucking clientele and the Road motherfuckers. did you ever consider the fact that your fucking fragile paper bubble wrap might rip apart in transit?  no, probably not. fuck all of you lazy myopic idiots.
