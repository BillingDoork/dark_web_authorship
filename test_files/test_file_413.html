    Hi all
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have flawlessly ordered from mr. ouid several times before with no problems. My latest order has been stuck in 'international hub' since the start of the month, and I am beginning to get the impression it's not going to arrive through my door. Adding to this, mr. ouid recently updated his page to say no bulk shipping to the uk until further notice, implying I'm not the only one in this position, however he states no reasons. What went wrong? Customs get new tech for Christmas?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is anyone else been in a similar situation? What sort of repercussions can I expect: raid, love letter, court?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any info much appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance

    Mrouid is on the way out from what i have been told by my sources and from the info i gathered in 10 minutes it would be easy to put ouid away for a while, if the cops were watching him, his game is about to be up.... trust me
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know he opened a new BTC cash out service...... i know he gave clients at least 2 addresses in montreal to send him cash to directly, who knows how many others he gave the addresses to, after a quick search on the quebec business  registry website i see that one of the address used for the btc cash out service is yhe same one he gave to bigbill,........... who by the way.... had his place raided by swat teams taking down meth dealers and pimps just weeks ago but he was unscaved, and is not under any investigation from what he said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think all canidian vendors need to worry as most of us are making mistakes on a daily basis and dont even know it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    especially fred and mrouid and bill...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would steer clear of these three vendors if i were you... anyways.... just thought i'd update... oh yeah... mrouid is also behind sjud or whatever that new site is!!!!!!!!

    Because people give out cash addresses ( in my case setup with a bogus USA ID and with the help of the employee at UPS ) we are a risk ? Your such a chump. You were spouting off about MJ getting you life in prison a few weeks back, get a clue buddy.

    yeah mail boxes... ups camaras.. you gave out your address to at least 5 people all of whom took your money.... all have your address and you did this from your vendor account... this means that if le were watching this site and saw your listing and placed an order....they would have an address that you walk into and has cameras and shit..... second... you came on the forums and stated how you use canadabitcoins to cash out now...lmao... you know that all LE has to do is watch those packages and your fucked... you will be caught... you and mrouid and bigbill... you guys are the chumps...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yoou guys are making the mistakes.... you guys have had your places raided by cops and most probably if they have not raided them yet its only because they are still watching....  be careful dude... you think you know about me..... I am a professional at distributing misinformation when needed.... you guys think I baited myself out on here....HAHAHAHAHA... you guys have no clue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    btw.. I was not going to tell you but because you are starting in on me i might as well.... The shipping company called me last week,, seems your package was dropped behind a recycle bin. i picked it up.  :D :D :D and thanks to you and your big mouth i have an extra 11k to throw into my rrsp.....  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THANKS DUDE!

    Of course .. "behind a recycling bin"

    It was never sent ... I knew this is how it would work out. I even told another member to keep note .. you would return in a few weeks and say the package was found but I dont get it. Your a rookie, chump.

    Perhaps I should have put "Any relevant info much appreciated." instead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Someone with a name like 'QC_M39_KING' flaming Mr. Ouid, especially with that karma? What a fucking surprise, I wonder what his motivation could possibly be!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless, I ask again: what are the feds likely to do if they intercept between 4 and 16oz coming to my address? How likely is it that my weed will never leave "International Hub"?

    just had a large shipment of his seized, it was in international hub for over 10 days and after around 14 days there was a controlled delivery, the person receiving signed for it and then got busted
    <br/>
    <br/>
    consider your shipment lost, and dont sign for it unless you want a record

    trava, are you saying that you had a controlled delivery or one of Mr Ouid's clients? If there are a cluster of controlled deliveries of his packages that would be highly unusual and his shipping is probably being watched. It would be a good idea to find some other people who purchased / received from him recently and cross notes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for OP's question, I don't know what amount of drugs get LE interested in a controlled delivery in Canada.

    Ive ordered from mr ouid before and it went very smooth. I ordered 8oz to the US. He shipped fast as hell and the bag was over with the best M39 I have ever had. Mr Ouid has really great deals and hes great to deal with.

    Hi i previously ordered from mrouid to the UK without any issues, packaging was excellent and shipping time was very fast 4-5 working days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now i seem to be in the same position as the OP, my parcel has been stuck in the GBCVTA,United Kingdom for around 10 days, no update has been made on the track history, really am gutted about this, hopefully a controlled delivery will not be made, OP please keep us updated on this matter, thanks,

    Got back from the shops to find a police van, complete with single tinted observation window parked slap bang opposite my house. When I checked a short while later it was gone. The funny thing is, when I went to my friend's later that afternoon, I must have seen at least 3 or 4 more tinted vans on the way there, which is way higher than normal in my area. Wonder what was so special about today?

    Do you honestly believe that the police are doing surveillance on you because a package containing 4oz is intercepted? (if it even is I dont think we know for sure yet!)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this is how the police operate in the UK then they have far more resources then the US police.
