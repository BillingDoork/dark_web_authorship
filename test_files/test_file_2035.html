    So would it be possible for a bug detector like the ones on sale on ebay to be used to detect any sort of LE bugs in your mail? would a detection tracking device be RF of a certain frequency or GPS or something undetectable?

    Pretty sure it works. As I read on this forum, those scanners scan for the radio frequency range that police are allowed to use. There are other bands, like military, that most scanners don't receive.

    I have yet to see any direct evidence or firsthand accounts of CDs where any electronic tracking or bugs are being used.  I'd think it would show up in public records/warrants/court records if they were.  If somebody here knows more or has experienced this please share (you'd think there'd be more cops on this site)

    anyways,
    <br/>
    Either a postal inspector delivers the package and you sign for it and they bust down the door 60 seconds later.  Or else (especially in the case of fake names/drops) they just deliver it normally and local PD observes from a distance and they bust whoever picks the package up &amp; they search both the location it was delivered to and the house of whoever picked it up or maybe even the homes of every person at the drop site (some judges will sign even the most expansive warrants)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would not trust an eBay bug detector.  If you are moving large amounts (big big $$$), and suspect you may be being monitored somehow, be serious about the tools you use.  Rent a nice spectrum analyzer, learn to use it, look for strong sources that shouldn't be there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you believe you have a bug in a package, open the package, look for bug (they're easy to spot)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are just buying small quantities for you / your friends / etc.. and believe you're being electronically monitored by sophisticated LEA bugs take the money you would have spent on the spectrum analyzer and go see a psychiatrist.

    this is why people should learn a lot more about their software before they begin using it.
    <br/>
    If you want to trust some random fool (who you literally DO NOT KNOW) on the internet, then go do that and have fun with it.
    <br/>
    otherwise, do some research and work out that you should probably run liberte/tails and work out how it works...

    interesting links, looks like they're probably just dropping in cell phone sized GPS tracker with some feature to detect package opening.  Then delivering the acutal drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they're probably cell network based (the recent ones) and are probably cell phone sized
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A "booster bag" won't help your legal case, nor will it prevent a bust.  At that point it's already too late.  They're not just dropping these off and driving away, the trackers are just to make damn  sure they don't loose the drugs or that the receiver doesn't flush them all down the toilet.  The tracker has nothing to do with the CD / bust.  It's likely just to cover the ass of the agent who gave the go-ahead to deliver the 5 pounds of MDMA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Booster bag or no booster bag there'll still be cops watching the delivery place and the guy who picks up the box is still gonna get charged.  If you kill their signal they'll just bust the door down when they realize that and they'll charge whoever has the booster bag with additional charges.

    The obvious benefit of planting tracking bugs is that they do not need to physically stay with and follow a package to see where it goes.  There's no need even to do controlled deliveries if a pkg is bugged. They need only to keep their iPhone or laptop turned on and wait for the tracker to tell you the package has been picked up.  It will also alert you when the pkg has been opened. as many of these devices have light sensors built in.  FedEx and UPS also use these light sensors to monitor movement of certain parcels that need special handling.

    my point for all this what if you were moving weight and had a PO BOX you were picking up at say a week and a half after delivery in the middle of the night, something they couldnt stake out. Or say you werent home when they delivered kind, and left in your letter box, and you didnt come home for a couple days, there either gonna have to abandon there CD or track you. now in this case would the tinfoil or bug detectors work?

    From what I read in those links the controlled deliveries were all "physically controlled" as in they always kept DEA or LE personnel near the package at all times.  I'm guessing the LE is very very sensitive about losing any amounts of drugs once they've detected them.  The tracking devices are likely "insurance" that they won't fuck up and lose the drugs somehow.  There was a postal intern who said they typically replace the drugs with a simulant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I was LE and it was a PO box drop I'd post local LE for as long as they were willing to stake it out.  When they ended the stakeout, replace the drugs with a simulant and put up some hi-res video-cameras to look for whoever picked it up.  Once the drugs are gone I'd wager that they no longer include the trackers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They might keep the trackers in the box with the fake drugs, but I dunno.  They sure as hell won't put the real drugs in the box without somebody around to keep an eye on them.  (I know there's LE reading this, why don't you guys chime in)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While they're staking it out the scanner/bag won't do much for you.  After they're done and have replaced it with fake drugs and a few cameras your bigger threat is "video evidence" somehow triggering a search of your house/car whatever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From what I read the postal inspectors and DEA are actually very competent people, you shouldn't underestimate them.  I would refrain from using PO box drops altogether.  For small to moderate quantities ship them to your real name at your real address.  It's less suspicious and If you get busted they can search, they can arrest you, but you should say nothing and have a lawyer present for everything (including search).  If your house is clean and you were smart about everything you'll get off scott free.

    If you go to a PO box drop under a fake name and pick it up and they bust you somehow, your lawyer will have a much much harder time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For large quantities you should consider other options than bricks in the mail, particularly for international shipments.  I'm not going to discuss these here because the few methods I know of were told to me in confidence, but there are a lot of people moving very large shipments by other methods and if you're in that business you probably already know what those methods are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this is your business then no matter what you do be sure you have a criminal defense lawyer you can call right away, pay the retainer, do initial consultation, etc... that will be far far more valuable to you than any piece of technology.

    So forget spending the $$ on a spectrum analyzer.  It would take a good deal of skill to figure out what's in a closed PO box in an uncontrolled RF environment like a post office, &amp; it's not an easy skill to learn.  Instead learn a lesson from the mob: lawyer up before the bust happens.

     From what I read in those links the controlled deliveries were all "physically controlled" as in they always kept DEA or LE personnel near the package at all times.  I'm guessing the LE is very very sensitive about losing any amounts of drugs once they've detected them.  The tracking devices are likely "insurance" that they won't fuck up and lose the drugs somehow.  There was a postal intern who said they typically replace the drugs with a simulant.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If I was LE and it was a PO box drop I'd post local LE for as long as they were willing to stake it out.  When they ended the stakeout, replace the drugs with a simulant and put up some hi-res video-cameras to look for whoever picked it up.  Once the drugs are gone I'd wager that they no longer include the trackers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They might keep the trackers in the box with the fake drugs, but I dunno.  They sure as hell won't put the real drugs in the box without somebody around to keep an eye on them.  (I know there's LE reading this, why don't you guys chime in)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While they're staking it out the scanner/bag won't do much for you.  After they're done and have replaced it with fake drugs and a few cameras your bigger threat is "video evidence" somehow triggering a search of your house/car whatever.

    jesus christ not everyone lives in your draconian society you call the United States.

    anyway if that were the case park your car a distance away so its not on the high res camera. plus you realise there are hats you can buy that will blind any sort of camera? Even If you don't wear it all you are is a person so unless LE knows you personally its not like your automatically found. Even if you lost your drugs you've still gotten of scot free to open a new PO box under a new name and try again and that's the most important thing. Of course all this only applies to bulk but its good to know.
