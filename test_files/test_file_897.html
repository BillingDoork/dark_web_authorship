    Referring to the US. Or does it keep going through customs when it arrives in each state? Do Europe shipments always go through east coast customs first or does it depend on the destination? Do Canada shipments always go through west coast customs? How about for locations like Alaska and Hawaii? Are they like their own countries?

    No customs between states. Only at the mails first point of entry into the USA when arriving from an external U.S territory. I believe Alaska &amp; Hawaii don't get inspected however the U.S Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The International Service Centers that sort the mail are  - Chicago, New York, Miami, Los Angeles &amp; San Francisco. So your overseas orders will go through one of these places depending on where it's coming from and how it's transported.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't have any information regarding where European orders go to. It would depend on the country it comes from and how they pre-sort the mail. One of two scenarios would happen - either it's pre-sorted in the country of origin by region. IE West Coast/East Coast/Mid USA etc and then sent to the nearest center to that. Or it's all sent to the East Coast - New York, maybe Miami, maybe Chicago then sorted and sent from there domestically.

    I hope this helps a bit.

    I use to work in logistics air/ocean and I actually had a map that showed if it leaves from this country where would it land and so forth, that map would of been helpful. But to my knowledge  - Asia (China, Korea, Vietnam) stop off the west which is Cali or Washington Everything from Europe stop off the east..NYC, New Jersey..It's that way with ocean and I believe it works the same with air...Canada,...I'm not to sure on that one but since it's up north it can reach any big city....Good thing I had to learn all this crap for my tsa certs This is the list of port of entry for passengers but also for cargo and in this parcels. Hope it helps.

    This is also might help on how customs work....The US it's Customs/TSA(Bigger a-holes and annoying as hell too) for packages , freight , etc coming in..For letters, I believe no, just goes into a sort machine..
