    Hello,
    <br/>
    I'm a new member to SR, I've made a couple of purchases but have received only Half of my orders.
    <br/>
    Coincidentally, the orders that have arrived are mostly drug paraphernalia.
    <br/>
    The orders that have arrived are some E-Cigs from America, which came in original packaging and don't look obviously like drugs. The second order was a vaporizer from China.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now for the failed orders:
    <br/>
    I made an order the same day as the E-Cig order of Xanax from Canada and it never arrived, the vendor re-shipped and that also never arrived. I also ordered some weed from the USA that didn't arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I'm wondering what could happen that somethings do arrive and somethings don't.
    <br/>
    When I Order I do it like this:
    <br/>
    I use my home address, and I use a Shortened/Nickname Version of my Name + my Last name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I read on the shipping section of the forum that packages that look more personal but are shipped in business envelopes, most vendors ofÂ  SR ship like this, are more likely to be flagged.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could it be possible that because of the way I write my name my packages are being flagged, inspected, and seized?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS. I live in Colombia, in case you have any relevant information about customs here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully, someone's had a similar experience or is experienced and can tell me what I've done wrong

    You should probably use your real name. I don't know shit about Columbia, but I'd probably stick to ordering from South America if you can. At least for now and see how that goes.

    It's actually safer to order from first world countries cause south americans don't suspect them at all. Also, there are like no South American.
    <br/>
    It be very helpful if someone could list some good south american vendors for pharmaceuticals and weed
