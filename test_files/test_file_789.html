    Ok I just got a package from Amsterdam and i'm a little worried.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The package had tape around the top of it. I wasn't sure if it was open and then resealed because I rip of the tape and it was hard to tell if it was opened or not
    <br/>
    But then I looked at the vac seal, It was clearly opened and then sealed again with clear tape to make it look like it wasn't oped at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To top it all off the package was a bit late so could it have been intercepted? Or was it the vendor trying to save on packaging?

    It's unlikely that it was the vendor, but it's possible.  Basically you have to ask him that.  How long ago did you pick this thing up?  The safest thing is to assume they're about to serve a warrant and flush everything illegal -- but that's quite a waste.  It really depends on the quantity, which you don't mention.

    Definitely ask the vendor (not quite sure why he would do that though). Id also like to think that police are a bit smarter than using an obvious piece of tape to close back a vac seal but then again maybe not.

    There's also no mention of what the substance is.  It could be fucking tobacco for Christ's sake, or something silly that they opened to test for one of the big 5 (or whatever the standard tests cover these days) -- and when they found no reaction, they sealed it up and sent it on its way.

    I'm assuming anything coming in a vac seal would indicate something you don't want to be caught with but yeah as SS said more details are def needed if you want some constructive advise mate.

    I don't know if it's TRUE or not, but RCs are supposedly still legal for non-human consumption purposes.  That's more what I was thinking, but you've got a point... the vac seal does kind of rule out something completely harmless to ship.

    Not something I'd be keen to explaining to LE,  a lot of RC's are now banned, they just keep churning out new ones though but LE is quite onto it, well they are some countries anyway, not sure how the game is played were the OP comes from.

    I know exactly what happened.  Exactly, I tell you!  Let me paint the picture for you: it was a dark and stormy morning... suddenly he was awoken by a gentle rapping against his window frame.  "What?!  Who-who's there???"  ... "I'm not expecting company!" he muttered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He then tripped and fell as he stumbled out of bed to open the window, sending the bluebird that sought only the sweet company of another living thing flapping for its life to the next door neighbor's house; on his way down, his foot twisted and careened like a hammer into the half-concealed package which he had thrown beneath his bed next to a pizza shortly after having received it a week ago while in a drunken stupor.  The phone he discarded after calling for the pizza came toppling down on top of his skull and clattered to the floor beside him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The world went dark.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Soon, when he came to, he quite naturally assumed that his local law enforcement agency had left the package to monitor what he did when faced with the inescapable guilt of his crime. They will, no doubt, be dragging him off to be raped by Bubba or Jonny-Sue or the like before the moon rises high in the night sky.  Crime, ladies and gentleman, does not pay...
    <br/>

    if It's legal then no need to worry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if it wasn't legal, sometimes customs check packages but can't be bothered to do the paperwork for small quantities. Customs officers are just like any worker, some do their work conscientiously, others don't.  That's happened to me once, bubble mailer full of shrooms, customs seal on the enveloppe but nothing happened afterwards and I 've received tons of orders since.

    It is illegal, I just misspelled it above.

    <br/>
    That could be a possibility, but the seal on the vac looked like someone tried there best to make it look like it was never opened. If it was a customs officer who couldn't care less he wouldn't have resealed so well.

    i doubt you are going to get raided. everybody says they will raid you directly after getting the package- so you dont have time to get rid of the evidence. clearly you have had plenty of time to clean house..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    obviously i would still clean house and take precautions but i'll bet it was the vendor. maybe he accidentally ripped it or something and is just too shitty of a vendor to re-vac seal so he just used tape.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    would LE really be careless enough to just rip open a box, a vac seal, then use tape to reseal it all? and THEN wait a few hours to bust you, giving you time to get rid of it all? doubtful, in my non-professional, educated guess of an opinion.

    That's about as far from clean as you can get, the first thing they would do is seize all your electronic devices and I'm not even going to talk about scales.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything on your computer must be encrypted with truecrypt and use a bootable USB for Tor and never leave it lying around or plugged in when you are not using it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's probably all just a false alarm or this is a load of BS, either way better to be safe than sorry. Plan for the worst and stop ordering to your home address, get a safe drop not linked to you, it's not that hard.

    No sign of LE yet and the vendor got back to me saying he didn't use any tape when packaging.
    <br/>
    So need less to say I'm pretty freaked out!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This doesn't make a huge amount of sense to me. If customs find it they wouldn't have sent it on to me and if the had find it and thought it was nothing illegal they would have resealed with tape saying "opened by customs". But it was simple tape. Could it be that they are waiting for me to order some thing bigger and then bust me? If that was so they did one bad job resealing every thing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also how much would they remove for testing? My order is short by a good bit.

    You think? I find it hard to believe that postal works would crack open the odd package for the dam with the hope there was some drugs inside.

    If it was a postal worker why not just take the lot? Why bother cover it up?

    Maybe he was an "honest" postman. Could the drugs be felt from the outside of the package ?

    Anyway, if it was the customs who opened the package, they should have put a customs seal. So to me it's either the vendor or somebody on the mail chain, but I very much doubt it's LE stuff.

    I'm not sure if the drugs could be felt from outside of the package.
    <br/>
    I'll see what the vendor says. I messaged him asking him how much he sent out just to verify that some had been taken.

    <br/>
    As for if I would go to prison, I really don't know! The law in Ireland about RCs is unclear as to what class the drugs are in.

    drugs laws of your country should be available on the net, on an authorities website. In my country we can get the full list of what's banned and all the laws regarding drug importation and consequences. But as I said, in my experience, small quantities won't get you in prison. The fine may be substantial though.

    Sorry I may have not made that very clear, I order 5 grams.

    But I got 4.5 in a taped up vac seal. Here is what the vendor said when I asked me how much did he send out and was it sealed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I had sent out 7gr fully vac sealed."

    This thread is deteriorating into a farce, are you seriously suggesting a customs inspector would go to the trouble of opening and removing .5g of mdma for themselves then tape it all up again??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Get a grip, if customs found it they would seize it, all of it. If the customs inspector was a did dodgy and had a mind to 'steal' it they would have just stolen the whole thing, again VERY VERY unlikely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they let it through to track it you would not have a clue it had even been opened, they are very good at opening and resealing things for investigation purposes and Ireland's customs are pretty tight from what I read on here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Who the fuck knows what happened to it, maybe the vendors runner fucked with it before posting it, maybe your postman likes to go raving, maybe this is all a load of bollocks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bottom line is you got your drugs, well most of them,  stop ordering to your home address.
