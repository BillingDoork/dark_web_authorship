    There are quite a few postings re Po Box vs Home adrs vs PO real ID vs PO fake Id.... so i've been reading and thinking as I recently had a little eye opener and refuse to take on any more avoidable risk (i mean short of not enjoying my life!). Anyway my apologies if this is addressed in another thread, but I've looked for a bit and not seen this same example so here it is:
    <br/>
    -pros/cons of getting a PO Box with real valid ID, just not yours.
    <br/>
    Say you have a DL that was lost by someone else recently, seems it would be simple enough to use this to then produce a second "proof of address" document. Why does this not work? Is there some sort of check done on the address used on the "proof of addrss" documentation? Assuming the pic is close enough likeness that it isn't a giveaway... please respond, i feel there must be some obvious reason this is not a good idea or many others would have posted. My thoughts were along the line of going to a UPS, or perhaps some 'mom &amp; pop' if i can locate one, using ID &amp; 'proof of address' docu w/bogus address, paying cash, receiving small occasional mailings. Any thoughts welcome.

    Faking an ID for a P.O Box is usually not necessary. This is mostly because an official mailbox is completely unnecessary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Again, once more, I insist that using virtual office mail boxes is the way to go. There is no stringent ID requirements and there's any other advantages besides. In my view, to call a post office mail box a service is a oxymoron.

    This topic just refuses to die, it reminds me of all those middle class people furtively smuggling wine or extra tobacco when they come back from holiday. I crack up deep down whenever I see them en route to the baggage queues for aircraft or ferries, so many responsible fathers with shifty eyes and mothers with pinched features gnawing their lips and fingernails while their kids run feral all over the port. The law makes criminals out of regular citizens so frequently to the extent it gives an opportunity cost shelter to organized crime such as SR. It's just cheaper and easier to just transship that stuff with a tiny probability of getting caught. Then you can have a nice long relaxing flight snooze before getting home to collect your 'contraband'. Oh look! Who could this 'gift' be for? Who could be so generous?! Oh right! Me! :)
