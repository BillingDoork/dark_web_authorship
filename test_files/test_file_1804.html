    Recently I purchased a small amount of weed domestically in Aus from the seller asdf345. It arrived quickly (couple of days), good stealth, a couple of stamps on the envelope/bag but guess what?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No postage mark! No ink marks from the post office to say its been sent through the system. I contacted the seller who was unaware of this................. Put in another order a week or so after first- couple days later exactly the same;package arrived but no postage mark.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To me it can only mean one of a few things. 1. Seller lives exceptionally close to my drop 2. Seller uses a courier (but then why the stamps) or  3. Something very dodgy is going on!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Haven't ordered again and wont until I hear some thought and views. The weed is amazing, price is too expensive though. Have any others experienced this?

    Don't sweat it. I've had that happen quite a few times. Never before I started ordering from SR, so that is the funny part. Then again, most packages I received before SR were ebay or amazon labels not stamped. So maybe lack of exposure is the culprit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've also recycled the stamps from some of my SR packages because they were never marked out :P

    I can't say anything official about Aus, but this isn't that unusual.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Envelopes typically go through machines that "cancel" the stamps on each and every one, but packages are often hand sorted, meaning a person physically stamps the postage. This person may have been overworked and just didn't for those packages, or didn't stamp it exactly the right way, but just sent the package on its merry way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Usually there are some other stickers or markings applied for routing, maybe not in Aus, and you could be right, the seller may be in the same postal region as you, and it doesn't take a very complicated path to get to you.

    Yeh never before have I experienced this prior to SR. From what you've said compared to what 001I has said, how can the stamps be re-used if a computer system cancels the stamps? Think there must be some differences between countries posting rules. Are you down under Triniton?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There were definatley no other markings on the envelope. And I've ordered from another seller who's postmark shows they are in the next suburb so this seller must be living next door to my drop. If that is the case, apart from the bonus of having a really close seller, what are the other perceived negatives I should be concerned about?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else have any comments about missing postage marks?

    Letters go thru a machine which will cancel stamps. All parcels need to  be manually stamped to cancel the stamps. It just means that this process has been skipped which is not uncommon. No need to be overly paranoid.

    I would say that you'll be fine. I have had lots of legit parcels w/ no markings on them. The hand-sorting theory sounds like the answer.

    Well, the things you find when you search for your name on here :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Troop, you're over thinking it. I have no idea why there were no post marks - honestly. You're the only one out of 145 transactions who's ever had this. I'm not going to go in to detail about why i've had 100% success rate with ZERO lost packages, but my system works. Proof is in the feedback and sales in my profile.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Price is something I'm slightly sick of having to explain - I'm a middle man not a grower. I can't compete with weedman, cana and the rest of them and I don't try to. They have their niche and I have mine. I offer great customer service, and a great product, for the price advertised. If I could do it for cheaper I would, believe me. You don't think i'd love to compete with the big guys? I just don't have the connections they obviously have.

    This. I'm still around, still selling, post marks are probably still missing - who knows?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I really need to start paying more attention to what is posted on here!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, it'd be nice if you'd add a follow up that you've been back and bought from me since then - your feedback said you were happy :)

    Right well I fucked that up by not checking this thread thinking after hearing from others it was legit. I was curious though, which is a lot different to paranoid. But apolgise to you sir, your price is fine, your weed is great and the delivery time is fucken superb. Have bought off asdf heaps since i (in my mind) had cleared this up.

    I recently received an order from the US to AU with no postage marks either which seemed odd to me, I wanted to work out the real shipping time over when marked 'in transit', carefully inspection showed nothing though so it's not just a domestic phenomenon.

    It's a bad idea to reuse a postage stamp once it's been affixed to a piece of mail that's been through the system...including stamps that may appear not to have been cancelled out.  Why?  Because you risk that sooner or later a mail sorter is going to notice that reused stamp and toss your package into the RETURN TO SENDER bin. This does happen, I promise you.  It's not worth the risk.
