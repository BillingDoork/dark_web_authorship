    Its possible Iv heard of it on many occasion and Iv heard that germany and uk packages usually are quick to US.
    <br/>

    This is abit of an off topic question but I was wondering as I dont have much experience with international orders,
    <br/>
    Are abbreviations in address ok for international orders or will it complicate things at all? such as dr instead of drive and CA instead of California
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know its most likely a stupid ass question but it has been bouncing around in my mind for a couple days and would love some closure on the matter

    Abbreviations in US addresses is the proper format.  You can get the proper format and full zip code for any US address at this link.

    Thank you Jack=)
    <br/>
    So if i sent an address not using all caps like it says proper format should have, I should send the vendor an encrypted pm with the correction of my address?
    <br/>
    cause I didnt use all caps like an idiot lol thanks again just want to make sure everything goes smoothly for both me and vendor

    It will be fine without all caps.  Machines and people have an easier time reading large fonts and capitol letters.  Machines can read 10pt just fine but I like to use larger because I like the postal workers to have an easy time reading it too.

    My express orders tend to be 3-4 days
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Airmail tends to be 6-10 (although it did take 30 once, although I believe the buyer was attempting to get 50% back however once I showed him my policy was 0% refund on airmail and SR confirmed that he would get 0% since my vendor page clearly says airmail is buy at your own risk, his package magically showed up)
