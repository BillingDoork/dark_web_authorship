    So I ordered a domestic amount of molly on the 5th. It was a Saturday night so obviously it wasn't shipped till the 7th on monday. Anyways I used first class free shipping and have yet to receive anything. I am so scared that I am done for. I don't know what to do other than depress over what happened and keep checking forums and silkroad with absolutely no reason. I messeged the vendor last friday asking him where my stuff is to which he replied "I had a lot of orders and sent some packages later". All the unrelated SR stuff from like ebay has been coming no problem and it's also all first class but this shit is just ridiculous. I don't know how to stop stressing knowing that the "mailman" could be knocking at my door any second trying to deliver my "package" like they do in C.D. What the hell is going on. Am I screwed or will I be fine.

    If your vendor is domestic there is less chance of it being examined for drugs. The dogs are at the international ports most of the time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I once got a refund from SR after 17 days and a few days later the vendor messaged me saying he just shipped and would I pay him when it came. This was for a North American transaction so 17 days should have been plenty, but he clearly did not send it when he said he did.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A few days later sure enough I had the package. And because I am nice and felt he delivered on his end deposited more coin because I had already spent the ones refunded to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you were to get a controlled delivery it would happen within a short time. It has not happened to me but I have read stories on here that hint it would be within a few weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If other people from the same time span have gotten orders I would maybe worry. But remember these are drug dealers, maybe he got high and forgot. One time I didn't get a package because the guy sent double to some buyers and none to some, mistakes are made.

    Almost same exact experience here. Waiting on tiny domestic order that shipped Monday 4/8. Ordered priority but there were issues so vendor had to send "parcel" or standard post (never heard of anyone here using less than first class but they told me it was parcel). Anyway they say theres no DCN and so while theyve been great at commnication this past week they are just as in the dark as I am. And everyone who ordered when I did got it within 3 to maybe 5 or 6 days at most it seems. Almost 9 business days in transit now and I am certain I didnt mess up my address so Im at a loss here... any ideas anyone?
