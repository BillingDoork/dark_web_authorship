    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I rented a P.O. box at one of the local "P.O. Box R Us" type stores. The problem is that the package was too big to fit in the PO Box, so they are holding it for pickup. But their "standard policy" is that I have to sign for the package. Crap.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do I do? I think it's just their standard CYA policy when people pick up packages. But I've always read to NEVER SIGN...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks, and help!

    How long was the package in transit for? Do you use the PO box for anything other than illicit deliveries?

    It was in transit 3-4 days. A normal time I think. The box is in a business name, and yes, there is other mail into the box, but not much yet since I just opened it.

    That is something you should have thought ahead. Is the order really too big for the box? For the speedy delivery I guess is from same country? If it is then probably you shouldn't worry about it. If you are not sure, ask the vendor for the dimensions.

    Im 85% sure there is nothing to be worried about if your item was in transit 3/4 days, just go and pick it up :)

    Thanks for the responses everyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I picked up the package without incident. They didn't end up making me sign, since I told them I forgot to bring the pickup slip - lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess I'll consider getting a larger box though...

    Careful! They planted tracking device on the drugs so when you consume them your body becomes a tracking device. Also, they will be able to record all what your eyes see and they'll also be able to hear your thoughts.

    Man imagine that, it would be a real pain. Jokes aside, congrats for your successful order and enjoy!

    This is pretty common practice. But you should definitely sign up for some business service information packets to your new box and keep the flow going.
