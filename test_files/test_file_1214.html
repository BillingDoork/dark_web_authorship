    It really varies. I've had one come in 6 days, and another not come for 3 weeks.

    I've had orders take up to 4 weeks to arrive to the US from NL!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Right now there might be some delays with shipping out of NL.  The vendor Sangaba just posted on his profile about it.   http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b62a21a48e
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else aware of current delays coming out of NL?

    Really, nothing good will come of finding out postal times for every country.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You may as well be asking for package descriptions and addresses next.

    without being too specific I can say from experience as buyer and vendor that shipping times inside the EU can very very widely. I have seen delivery times
    <br/>
    from 2-14 days between the same countries, exactly same type of package and labels.
    <br/>
    I have actually received a package once from another country that was faster than 90% of packages sent from the same country I live in...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF you really need to know the day of arrival (e.g. for temporary mail-drops) you will have to check the tracking number or have the vendor check it for you, but that involves
    <br/>
    additional risks and/or work. So never do that unless you know what you are doing, In short, do not check via TOR nor your real IP.
    <br/>
    And ask the vendor before ordering if he will give you the tracking number. I usually give it to them but at the same time inform them that I won't give any refunds if the package is seized, usually I keep the tracking number just in case there is some escrow-dispute (and of course only as long as the package is in transit).
