    I am working on getting everything together to start a vendor account dealing Domestic (USA) LSD and can not find any info on if it is customary for someone to vacuum pack lsd or just wrap in foil (along with other stealth raising materials) and ship it... I ask this as I have not ordered any lsd from SR (I think its about the only thing I have not ordered aside from pharms, meth and heroine, just not my disease ya know?!) and am not sure on the shipping requirements/standards for this and have not been able to find anything through searching on this subject..Â  Any help or advise or links are greatly appreciated..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just tired of seeing people get rapped for their coin with the prices vendors are currently charging for this wonderful experience (based on domestic pricing)... Thanks in advanced!!

    Focus on the outside of the packaging. Make it look professional.
    <br/>

    I've seen LSD put inside brochures, plastic bags, foil, and inside greeting cards. It doesn't matter. Remember not to leave your fingerprints anywhere, don't use your home return address, and to use multiple drop sites that don't have surveillance.

    I don't have any specific knowledge or reasons, but I think it might not be a good idea to wrap them in foil. Metal in an envelope just seems a little weird.

    I have received blotters stuck to the back of stickers and placed on the edges of a letter (to "seal" it), Ive seen them wrapped in tin foil as well and taped inside the envelope, and recently I have received one with the blotters inside a plastic baggie inside of a tictac case (I also orders a DMT pipe from the same vendor, so that may be why he went that route. I agree with the statement that metal in an envelope would seem weird, I like the wax paper idea. Honestly, my advice is to write a letter wrap the blotters in wax paper and tape the paper somewhere inside the envelope and send it.

    PS could you post your vendor account on the forums when you get it? If you are domestic US I may be interested in good LSD

    Oh I will.. Decided it wont be till the holidays are over so I have time to check SR every hour or so and keep up with people as I start the new biz.. Wont announce my seller account name with this account as I want them to be two separate entities as I will still be buying items off the road for myself but I will be sure to make it known that a new L dealer is on the road when the time comes..
