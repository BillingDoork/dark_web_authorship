    I orderd from a vendor monday and he said if i got my order in fast it would go out that day. So i orderd and msg him asking did it make it out. He reply's with " Its out" But i check the order later and it never says in transit so i msg him back asking whats the deal he then reply's with Sorry i missed getting it out tonight but i will ship it tomorrow(Meaning tuesday) express and pay out my own packet. Well today is now Wen and its yet to say in transit. And on top of that i msg him thanking him for the express then the guy msg me last night asking what was i talking about and he hoped i wasnt going by his 2weeks ago offer for the elections on his page...WTF? He still has yet to reply if it went out other than the first time he claimed it was sent..

    I hope we both can get this resolved through SR soon. The samming or not so responsible sellers seems to be out of control on SR lately.
