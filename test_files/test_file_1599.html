    Guys after reading sooo many threads where people are getting CD's and what not people always say you should wait days to pick up the package in case they're sitting on it.  That's great advice.  The only problem is I keep reading in all these vendors' pages that they want you to finalize within 24 hours or next time they'll just cancel the order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How as a buyer are we supposed to take security to the next level by giving the package time before picking up/opening it when vendors insist that we finalize right away if not early?

    Why not discuss this with the vendor prior to placing orders? They just may make an exception for you.

    Personally, I would look elsewhere if they want FE before shipping. I see SR as a shared risk for buyers/vendors and staying within escrow is the only insurance policy to help protect both sides.
