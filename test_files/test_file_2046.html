    I understand it is a lot less risky to order powder mdma from a vendor than pills but, as of right now I don't have much of a choice. I don't know if I should wait for the mdma or instead get defcons. If I were to purchase the defcons there would be 200+ pills, which I feel is a huge risk especially from someone in the U.S. Has anyone had any any experience with ordering this many pills internationally to the U.S? What would you recommend or advise?

    Thank you in advance!

    Coming from france is definitely less riskier than ordering from NL, it would depend on your vendor and how well he could package it. If it is stealthy enough, i think you should okay.
