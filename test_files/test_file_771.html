    Hey everybody, I need some advice, please - would like to know how you all would handle this situation:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered some cannabis pops from a new vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The pops were shipped in a  #10 business envelope with one stamp on it.  Correct postage is three stamps.  There were lollipop sticks poking out of the envelope.  The vendor did not use bubble wrap as stated in the listing.  The "package" was not "professional looking mail" as stated in the listing, it was a bulging, torn-up mess!  The vendor charged in excess of $5.00 for shipping (which I was happy to pay until I saw the "packaging").
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can you all help me weigh my obligation to SR buyers?  Should I leave honest feedback and spell out everything that was wrong with the order via public feedback or should I discuss the matter privately with the vendor via PM?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The buyer in me wants to use SR feedback as it was intended to be used - to help other buyers.  The human in me wants to communicate privately with the vendor because s/he is SO new.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the order had been for weed or pills I would not be asking this question - I would just leave honest feedback but we're talking about lollipops ... I don't know what to do ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What would you do?

    I thought it arrived and you needed to pay postage that hadn't been payed up front.  I've heard of this occurring before and the buyer related that (s)he paid the postage and everything ended up working out.  That person had A LOT more balls than me.  I'd have forfeited the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In your situation I'd definitely contact the vendor first.  If the vendor is amenable to the situation and resolves it to your satisfaction(convinces you the packaging has improved DRAMATICALLY, and any other recompense you feel you're due), then leave feedback saying there were a few bumps in the road but they were resolved.  If the vendor is rude/discourteous or doesn't correct the problem, I'd definitely leave feedback warning other potential buyers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The feedback system is there for a reason and if you don't warn other's you're doing us all a disservice.  However, you SHOULD give the vendor the chance to correct the problem; ESPECIALLY since he's so new.

    OK, I will PM the vendor for sure and I'll finalize because I don't want anything from the vendor except for them to get a clue or get off SR.

    Thanks for your help &amp; the good advice - most appreciated!  Still don't know what to do about feedback, because I feel like my only choice is to give 5/5 but spell out the deficiencies in the packaging.  I just dunno but thanks very much  :-*

    You can finalize and NOT leave feedback immediately.  Then after your interaction with the vendor leave appropriate feedback.

    I had this happen with a vendor that sent a small package first class mail and I received a brown envelope in the mail asking me for $1.10 with the name of the business on the return label. I was immediately like WTF and messaged the vendor and he confirmed that it was his package and apologized. It was only a gram of hash oil and having ordered from the same vendor recently, I knew his stealth was sufficient even if it got opened (thank god) for the item to not be clearly viewed as illegal. I have had the same mailman for like fifteen years, we get tons of mail to my address everyday, and I saw it like this; things like this happen with USPS everyday, that is why they have forms and procedure for it. Although it maybe rare, its not a damning incident for an item to show up postage due and would probably stand out even more going unclaimed in my opinion and personal situation. But what you do is up to you to decide, if the item is relatively small, personal use quantity, and well packaged, then I would not be worrying so much.

    Wow. I don't know, Wintermoon. That's not a level of service that reflects some kind of honest mistake. That is the definition of clusterfuck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would definitely not let the vendor get away with "fixing" the situation with you unless you feel 100% confident that no warning need be extended to other SR members. And I almost can't imagine what kind of communications from a vendor who would do that in the first place would leave me feeling that confident.

    Thanks again, guys.  I finalized the transaction then I sent a PM to the vendor to let them know I had to pay extra postage &amp; that the envelope was ripped up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Got a response right away, vendor was apologetic and seemed receptive to the suggestions I made for improving their packaging. They also said their focus was on the product, not packaging/shipping (what??? fuck me!)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will leave feedback later - need to think about it but I will def say something about the crappy packaging &amp; that the vendor agreed changes need to be made.  Too many of us have too much at stake here, PlutoPete was right - doesn't matter if it was only lollies so thanks PP!

    Happy Saturday everyone, let's get high!

    I would always give the vendor a chance to appreciate your advise and say they will do much better. I hope you will pm them a link to this thread and maybe the sticky in security about "ditch the PE".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't feel they are serious about improving their packaging to a proper level, you have a duty to warn buyers in your feedback even if you give a 5/5. Be sure you give them time to read this thread if you currently don't think they will improve their packaging properly.  NWN

    How can you say it is not a big deal? The shipper needs to be very familar with the postage regulations, weigh the package with an accurate scale and apply at least the correct amount of postage. Anything less is careless and gives the package undue attention,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mistakes can happen and I suppose I could forgive postage missing a few days into a rate change (but I assume the Post Office would do the same) but clearly that is not the case. The vendor described here has absolutly no regards when their merchandise arrives packaged in a regular envelope with parts of the shipment sticking out with the wrong amount of postage both before and after the rate change.

    I will be the first to admit I had fucked up some of my orders by attaching incorrect postage stamps. My packaging is well above par and my customers had nothing to worry about when going to pay pay the extra bit I didn't pay and I refunded them whatever they spent!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On to the OP....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should never leave dishonest feedback. Always be straight and concise. If the packaging was shit let people know he needs to step it up. Also offer the vendor some constructive criticism in private.

    This ^ is what I did.  I tried to be polite but I did not mince words.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I told the vendor straight-up when vendors screw up packaging then buyers go to jail.  I shared with them how I package pops (and why) and they said thanks, they would work on the packaging so that's the feedback I will leave:  Great product but packaging was sub par.  Spoke to vendor about pkging &amp; vendor agrees changes need to be made.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, will assign a numerical rating to the various components of the transaction:  Product gets a 5 (maybe a 6!),  Communication gets a 5,  Packaging 0.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor could not have been nicer or more professional or more apologetic in their response to me.  This is noteworthy because my PM was a blistering lecture of sorts.  I think they get it... I took the time to explain why I was so upset with the packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks, folks, appreciate your helps  :-*

    that's about the best outcome you could have hoped for :) i had a similar problem once but i left feedback first and it escalated into a huge argument. he kept harassing to get me to agree to a reship when his packaging was awful and all i wanted was for him to say he'd start vac sealing weed and i'd have changed my feedback to reflect that. shitty weed it was too and his attitude was appalling.. like i'd hand over my address again to this guy again for more haha he'd probably send me a shit in a box

     that's about the best outcome you could have hoped for :) i had a similar problem once but i left feedback first and it escalated into a huge argument. he kept harassing to get me to agree to a reship when his packaging was awful and all i wanted was for him to say he'd start vac sealing weed and i'd have changed my feedback to reflect that. shitty weed it was too and his attitude was appalling.. like i'd hand over my address again to this guy again for more haha he'd probably send me a shit in a box

    It was a great outcome for OP!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember though, your not being a jerk by angrily messaging a vendor or leaving below a 5/5 when YOUR FREEDOM was placed at risk. Vendors with bad shipping practices HAVE to be held accountable so if it takes a bad feedback for them to get their act together than so be it.

     Thanks again, guys.  I finalized the transaction then I sent a PM to the vendor to let them know I had to pay extra postage &amp; that the envelope was ripped up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Got a response right away, vendor was apologetic and seemed receptive to the suggestions I made for improving their packaging. They also said their focus was on the product, not packaging/shipping (what??? fuck me!)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Will leave feedback later - need to think about it but I will def say something about the crappy packaging &amp; that the vendor agreed changes need to be made.  Too many of us have too much at stake here, PlutoPete was right - doesn't matter if it was only lollies so thanks PP!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Happy Saturday everyone, let's get high!

     <br/>
     Cheers  :-*

    Lol I was just about to buy those lollipops but decided to wait a few days, glad I did.
    <br/>
    However at least it was just lollipops instead of a bag of bud sticking out of the envelope :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although why the fuck is the vendor focusing on his product and not shipping?
    <br/>
    Your product should be 100% ready to go with all the kinks in your process worked out before you start selling on SR.

    This happened to me a while back from a vendor who is not around anymore. I simply signed the slip and placed the change in the mailbox. Left the house for a day came back and voila!

    :-\ I need some advice with this exact situation, well sort of. I am only expecting one thing and it is due today. I get home from work to find a usps note stating I owe 3.04 dollars for a package. It does not say from who or where. I have messaged the vendor and no reply yet. I am very concerned because postage was paid with the order. How do I know this is not LE. I have had 20 packages sent here in the last 6-8 weeks with not one problem. This is a suck ass feeling to not know what the hell is going on. If I knew it was a mistake from the vendor then ok I will deal with it, but this vendor has screwed up from the get go with taking almost a week to get the order out and now this. And of all things it is weed capsules, fuck.. Any help would be greatly appreciated... :-\
