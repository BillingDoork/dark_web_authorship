    Ordered some shit from one of the top vendors on here with apparently mega stealth. It's been 4 weeks now and still nothing. During that time one order from a newish vendor arrived and that order was placed after the one I'm still waiting on.

    Maybe it was so stealthy that it was delivered...but it was invisible, so like you didn't know about it.

    Nah I've been keeping an eye on anything from overseas and nothing has arrived, it's all been domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been talking with the vendor and they are pretty dubious about it because they've not had any problems in the last few weeks. Just noticed the other day that they put my country on the list of countries that they won't ship to.

    Reckon I should be asking for a refund?

    Vendors always say that until a slew of people chime in with no shows, if its a largish order take it to resolution mate and ask for a refund, at the end of the day SR will decide but I wouldn't be holding out for much. However in saying that if it's a smallish order you may just want to cut your loses and save your stats and change vendors. Not much help I know... hope it works out for you.

    Cheers buddy. It's 10g's and is enough for me to be annoyed about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I took my time to chose this vendor because their stats are so good and their shipping is apparently mega stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I gave them an update a couple of days ago but haven't heard back. My first bad experience with the Road. Lame.
