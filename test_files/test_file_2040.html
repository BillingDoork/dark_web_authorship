    If your not prescribed them then yes it is illegal obviously.  If you get caught you will get a slap on the wrists unless it is a scheduled prescription drug like adderall/ritalin or oxycontin/oxycodone..drugs in those categories oh and of course steroids. If you get caught receiving or sending large amounts of those you will get more then a warning.

    It totally depends where you ship from or where you receive at. But since you just assume everyone knows where you are at, it can only be 'Murica :)

    The answer to your question(if taken literally) ...is NO.  It is not illegal in the US to send a valid, legally filled prescription through the mail or by courier (domestically only) providing of course, the sender is licensed to do so by the DEA.  Obviously, if it's legal to send it's going to be legal to receive as long as the prescription was written for you.

    <br/>
    Here's some interesting shizzle published by the DEA that lists the laws drug prescribers and dispensers(practitioners) must follow.
