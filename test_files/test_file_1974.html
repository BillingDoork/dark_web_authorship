    I was just wondering with all the hype about shipping to Aus is there any vendors that are actually getting through?
    <br/>
    if anyone could vouch for someone that is packaging securely and actually getting through customs it would be great.

    This is the exact reason why customs siezer rates go up. Why create an Australian specific shipping thread telling them which vendors to target. Lets not make it easy for them just do your own research before ordering simple as that

    YES. EXACTLY.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fuck I thought us ozzies had more balls..... and brains?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Enough with this shit. "Where is my package should I be afraid?" FFS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If can't handle, go elsewhere. If paranoia and stress too much then pick a new hobbie.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All these kids are just fucking it all over for everyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is why we are seeing SR on primetime news
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's simple - they want to show mum and dad's they are protecting society, so they'll try and get anyone, big or small to splash on the front page - the more it's in the primetime the more pressure they have to show their doing something..... i.e, busting kids with a point or two and front page "International drug arrest - issue under control oz pigs onto everything" keeps everyone feeling safe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's not give them more ammunition,.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this is all of such concern, I'd suggest another medium to obtain what you are after - SR has it's risks as perfectly stated and understood by those with any common sense.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Posting threads doesn't make your mail arrive or reduce chance it will.... in fact the opposite.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chat with ETM or Cozmo, pop a Xanax and get a hold of yourselves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Common sense ppl.... seems to be not so common.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry for the blah....... but seeing this everyday just pisses me off, and makes people start worrying about nothing.... it will be our undoing.

    sending stealth to AUS from USA, anyone know a reliable postage calculator (online) for coming up with how many stamps you have to put on?

    Guys, this is what I think we should do with this type of thread,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Start a new tread regarding AUS shipping success rates And only give out info via PM using PGP.
    <br/>
    And info should only be supplied by long time members? Just an idea anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or just do your research, and keep repeating this in every thread regarding AUS shipping. Especially ones started by newbs. Which I am a newb myself but it still shits me seeing all the sensitive info people post on this forum. I even feel paranoid posting what country I"m from.

    there are a couple of knitting circles of aussies around the place. most recently some asshat had a thread about aussie alumni or some shit, reakoned he was getting 1337 contacts, personally i wouldnt touch him with a 10ft barge poll.

    As shiz said DO YOUR RESEARCH, Anyone who needs to ask "where should i get this" "who should i get this from" obviously has not done any RESEARCH of there own and are just relying on others for the research they have done, THEY DO NOT DESERVE ANY INFO GIVEN TO THEM!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DO YOUR RESEARCH AND TAKE A RISK AS EVERYONE ELSE DOES!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As in what research heres a few tips, start with looking for the product you want pick a top vendor and read through there page to make sure they ship here then scroll down there feedbacks and check for any feedback relating to yr country, you should notice how long it took as well... From doing that very simple research you have found out that yes the vendor does ship to my country, yes there has been successful shipments to my country, yes i now know how long i should be expecting to wait till the goodies are in my letter box give or take a few days...
    <br/>
    If you are still not sure go to the rumor mill and search the vendors name and look through there review thread...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Very very simple!
    <br/>
    Please keep the aus threads to a minimum as it hurts the aus community in general, when u have been here a while u too will get sick of dum aussie noobs bringing more unwanted attention our way:)

    Yes, we agree whole-heartily with Shiznit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Forget so called "Alumni" from members who have been around for only  a few months. Do your own thorough research. Look for reliable and consistent sellers who value their security and yours, this is the foundation of SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck on the road!

      Start a new tread regarding AUS shipping success rates And only give out info via PM using PGP.
      <br/>
      And info should only be supplied by long time members? Just an idea anyway.

     longtime members sure as shit aren't going to give out information to people they dont know. and whos to say they arent LEO or  giving misinfomation to get people pinged.

     there are a couple of knitting circles of aussies around the place. most recently some asshat had a thread about aussie alumni or some shit, reakoned he was getting 1337 contacts, personally i wouldnt touch him with a 10ft barge poll.

     other than doing your time and getting to know people, in hope that you might get a +i you will have to research shit yourself and take a punt ;)
