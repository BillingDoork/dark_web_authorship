    Hey,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I travel around the globe pretty often, to countries which have many vendors here on SR. Domestic mail is safe, and that is why I wonder why so many vendors do not want to ship to boxes, and some even refuse to ship to boxes, even if domestic? I fail to see any logic here, can someone help me? I am going abroad soon and would like to get my hands on drugs.

    Surprised about that too. Some don't even like APT#'s!!! - I saw one speed dealer actually annoyed that people aren't putting the whole country name," no USA or UK ! ! !" His profile reads. When spelling out United States draws huge attention, and USA is actually USPS correct. Spelling out the country causes hand sorting. - I say, screw them, and search for the ones willing to work with you. If you have a reputable buyers transaction history, any decent vendor should want to work with you. Also if you have a regular vendor, you've been chummy enough with, but you want something from a vendor new to you (and you to him obviously), ask your chummy vendor, if he'd vouch for you, in case of a trust issue. They can also always send a test letter/parcel to establish trust with a code that you simply message back to the vendor. I see lots of ways around this. Also if you have a friend or business associate in the city you travel to, you can always ask that they accept a package "in care of John Whomever" - bottom line, it's doable, just have to have established trust. Perhaps ask that the return address of the vendor, be a company type related to the business that you're in.
    <br/>

    Hope this helps. - Just ideas here. Never actually tried this on SR, but have mailed drugs throughout the US long before Bill Gates met Steve Jobs. ;)

    Well my post says:Â  and if I had packages returned to a fake address I guess I would want it the way they say.
