    Do Customs inspect parcels that are sent between Australia and New Zealand or vice-versa, does anybody know? If a parcel arrives in Australia from New Zealand is it subject to the same stringent Customs inspection as if it came from the rest or the world, or are they more lax?

    Customs would be more lax on these packages being that they usually look for drugs coming from places like europe or asia, they would not expect anything coming from nz

    ^ wrong!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But you are semi-correct.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aus to NZ is not as good as one would think,.. They are mostly not looking for drugs, however. But other things that are a danger to the environment. And just come accross drugs in the process. Australia is high radar for that kind of stuff (not drugs).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this is from my understanding.
