    inspired by the nice 'ordering to japan' thread, lets centralize what we can for korean orders
    <br/>
    <br/>
    general things working for / against you:
    <br/>
    -no due process bullshit, no deniability
    <br/>
    -snitch culture
    <br/>
    -aggressive customs
    <br/>

    these poor bastards knew  they couldn't get weed mailed, and so i doubt  they were so foolish as to sign for a controlled delivery. my guess is that if your name is on the intercepted package, it's equivalent to possession. korea doesn't fuck around, and they know foreigners are the ones doing drugs. welcome to the most xenophobic country on earth, whitey. have fun in prison.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    snitch and  ~5 years becomes ~5 months. this encourages random finger pointing that you have to try and avoid by *not fucking talking about drugs.*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    alright, having stated some negatives, what can you do?
    <br/>
    -order only envelopes
    <br/>
    -order in korean
    <br/>
    -order to a dead drop
    <br/>
    <br/>
    merely being 'sent to a foreigner' is a red flag for customs, so be sure to print  the address in korean. and of course there's more to add about successfully ordering here, so lets get it out and about.

    So I can send Koreans to jail from the privacy of my home just by sending them a tiny bit of weed in an package?  I can send innocent people away for years for less than $2?

    indeed. you are right to highlight a tension with my general claim. i don't know what to make of it, and it seems crazy that your suggestion obtains.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so of course maybe i'm just out and out wrong on that notion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    on the other hand, there are some confirmed and almost equally crazy things about korea. use is equivalent to possession, and a failed piss test (which you cannot legally refuse) sends you directly to jail. also worth noting that koreans are imprisoned for breaking korean law anywhere in the world. it doesn't matter whats perfectly legal in nederlands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    plus, while there probably isn't an overtly racist double standard in the law, in practice, foreigners are certainly playing by a different set of rules here.

    Yeah Brit way of saying the same thing, I guess. Does sound a lot better than Locked Up Abroad. The guy from free korea was getting hash sent from Phils to free korea and picking up Post Restante, so not the best way to do it. 3 - 4lbs at a time. Think he did a year or two or ran away on bail or something. I can't recall seen so many eps. most are hired mules that get caught in South America or SE Asia.

    Sounds like the same episodes with a different name.  I think I saw that one.  The man sentencing him didn't know much about hash and he told him that he mixed it in his coffee and that's why he had so much.  He got off nice.  Is that the same episode?

    I remember he had a gf called "rabbit" or "rocket" or something weird like that. He got away with it once and the second time he made the gf go pick it up and I think thats where they got sprung.

    yeah why fuck with hash though in a country like that at least where you or I live they understand its just pot.

    Those eps tend to blend together for me, I must admit. I remember some guys muling gold from Burma to India or smth once and getting caught.

    Funny how many get caught on their "first or second" time never, "i did it for 5 years, never got caught until....."

    Apparently its becoming a problem there now since all they do there is smoking and drinking. Dont quote me on is but didnt the VICE documentary about Best Korea mention that 60% of all male adults there have either a smoking or drinking problem? Anyways to share my experience on shipping to South Korea, I have shipped there twice (LSD both times) and the customers received it so even though its quite a limited sample I cant report any problems shipping from the Netherlands to S-Korea!

    Most everything that I've read and that folks have told me is that messing around with drugs in East/Southeast Asia is just NOT worth it. Most countries in the region have ZERO tolerance for drugs and have strict mandatory sentencing if not mandatory death sentences. Things like blotter would be easy to hide with a lot less risk but order drugs that take up larger volume just by their nature can get people in SERIOUS trouble compared to western countries.

    I didn't believe this, so I did a quick google and.... What?! That's so weird and kind of ironic for such a draconian society. It does seem kind of torturous when you think about it though, taking into consideration the low quality and availability of food in the region.
