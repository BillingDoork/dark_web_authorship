    So, I work in a business where I know when people will be on vacation and will not be at their house and when they will be returning.  I'm wanting to know if anyone has some tips or experience on social engineering postmen into releasing a package to someone who is outside the place of delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One other method I was investigating was delivering the package to someone else's house, then going there and saying I live just up the street and I typed in the wrong house number, did you get any package delivered today you weren't expecting?

    This will end well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I DO NOT recommend you do this. Sending packages to your own address with your properly-spelled name is the safest thing to do. Remember, you want your deliveries to blend in with your normal mail and not raise any flags whatsoever.

    No offence, but this might be the worst idea I've read on these forums to date.  I think you need to go back to the drawing board or better yet just use a tried and true method that has been discussed here repeatedly.  No reason to reinvent the wheel.

    thanks for the illuminating response.  no need to re invent the wheel and yet i should go back to the drawing board.  well done.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway sorry for not making myself clear, but this has nothing to do with the contents of the package.  i already ship contra to my house.  in fact the contents of the package is perfectly legal.

     If its not illegal, why would you even need to think about sending somewhere besides your house?

    unless this is some new form of money laundering, i have never heard of anyone laundering that needed to mail packages to somewhere they werent associated with (home or office)...very strange

    but i respect the hustle, play on playa
