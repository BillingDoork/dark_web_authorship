    I'm sure everybody knows this, right? But just in case... Media Mail can be opened for inspection by any postal employee at any point in its journey- no warrant or Postal Inspector General or other hoop-de-doo such as would be required to open a piece of First Class or Priority Mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Media Mail is for media only- books and such- and its often way cheaper than other mail classes. As a result, people try to use it to send non-media items and save on postage, so the postal service has given itself permission to inspect MM at will to make sure they only contain allowable media items.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Subject to Inspection! Thank you and good day.

    I'm not a seller, but I used to use media mail to try and be slick with Ebay stuff. Out of 7 boxes, 5 got intercepted for abuse of services and held hostage at the post office, since I was mailing stuff like stereos and car parts for pennies on the dollar.

    That's great, ha, basically you have to go through what us vendors do on here and stealth up your shipment in hopes it doesn't get caught!
