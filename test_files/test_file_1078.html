    I had an order shipped last Friday vendor confirms it was shipped on Friday. He said he shipped it first class which sometimes takes longer than priority but still no show today. Should I be worried?

    If it marked it shipped Friday it probably ship till Monday. Normally, takes 3~5 business days. But may take up to 7. 7 Days was the longest I had to wait for a first class letter and that was shipped two days later after it was marked shipped. Some vendors don't ship exactly when they mark it shipped. But after 10 days you will have an option to resolve.

    He sent me a message saying it shipped friday and he says three days guaranteed on his page. Thanks though my mind is resting a little easier for the time being.

    There is no possible way for him to guarantee USPS will have it there in three days if he's shipping first class.  The only  "three days guaranteed" he can possibly offer is that he will have it shipped within three days.  I wouldn't worry.  USPS does wonky things all the time.

    Yeah you gotta relax guy this isnt Amazon..Im on my ninth day of waiting on a first class package...but rather than getting flustered I calmly brought it to the vendors attention, they gave me a tracking number, and we realized that it was "missent", meaning it was sent to the wrong state and is being rerouted.  USPS does shit like this all the time.  If it drives you uncontrollably mad than take the responsibility upon yourself and order priority or express.  Thats really the only way around it.  First class isnt what it used to be after recent cutbacks.

    Iv had 1st class take a full week.. Also as the other member pointed out THERE IS NO WAY POSSIBLE he can promise you when a 1st class parcel will arrive, Not really even priority for that matter, with priority he can give u a ETA but that can always mess up due to USPS fuck ups..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a 1st class parcel sent MondAY, im guessing it didnt star t flying til Tuesday but i'll know by Sat i feel..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not all vendors truly send the parcel just cause it was marked 'In transit' that day.. I had a new vendor i gave a shot who marked my parcel in transit on a Monday but was not post marked and sent really til thursday of that week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So give it up to 7 full days.. If nothing shows, msg him and ask for a reship or refund. If he refuses take him to resolution. He has no proof he sent it to you cause its first class, so depending on your stats and his, u will get
    <br/>
    maybe 100% or at least 50% refund..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope that helps some. Hell iv had 1st class mail from Netherlands get here faster than our usps 1st class mail!!  NO BS!! even iv had Canada Mail arrive faster than our 1st class mail... Blew my mind..
