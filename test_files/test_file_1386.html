    So, I had a fuck up and I'm curious what are the consequences.. I was a few days in a hotel, I had a small order sent to me at the hotel. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to check out early B4 the package arrived. I talked to the girl at the front desk and explained that I had mail coming nd asked that they hold it and I would return later that day, the same day I had to check out, to pick up my mail. She told me it was no problem  Well, by the time the mail came, there was a new girl working the desk and she apparently refused the mail and in the end the PO returned to the return addy, which was obviously false. Whats gonna happen? I'd guess it will go to some sort of dead letter department. Will they eventually open the package? Don't they need a warrant for this? If they do get a warrant and open it, how long would  this process take with warrants n judges involved, and if they DO do this, will they trace my name, which is kinda an uncommon last name, to my real addy and ruin it as a good addy to recieve shipments? The letter had my real name but that's it, no  real address or anything  .

    That is a freakin awesome answer, thanks for that bit of info my friend. That means there is no way my regular drop addy won't be compromised for at least a year., if ever.
    <br/>
    Thanks for putting my mind at ease..

    Not true.  Undeliverable mail that ends us at the USPS Mail Recovery Center is processed as soon as possible (as in opened or x-rayed) to determine if there's any chance of identifying the sender or intended addressee.  Generally mail is held there for 90 days before either being destroyed or set aside for public auction.  Obvious contraband gets held for Inspectors.

    This is true.  Goes to the dead mail center and gets opened.  Packages with drugs are handled carefully as they are sent to postal inspectors.

    While i think it's likely the parcel will get opened, it's the longest of long shots that LE will connect the dots to start watching mail to your home. I'd be astonished if you even got a phone call.

    Had the guy checked in using phony ID I might agree he has nothing much to worry about.  However, since his name is on the pkg Inspectors will be able to track this guy down in about 15 minutes.  Who knows what they may or may not do with the info?  Maybe they are interested in the sender?  You never know... but one thing you DO know is it's no sweat for them to track him down IF they want to.  That's enough for me to take the matter seriously.  Of course, I'd NEVER, EVER have drugs mailed to me in my real name nor would I use a shipping address that could be so easily traced back to me.  But that's just me.  I know many of you out there think you know better.

    You can not use your real name?
    <br/>
    Then what do you do? Use a fake ID and a fake house and fake everything?

    <br/>
    USA is probably more fucked up than I can imagine but to me it seems there is nothing to worry about. It was a small amount and LE has better things to do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if they're on this forum you are making their job a lot easier just by creating this thread with all the info...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they kept mail for a year then they would need many buildings just to store all the mail.
    <br/>

    Seems pretty awesome to work in the mail department in the USA. Especially as an investigator. Free drugs all the time. Why don't you team up and take over the mail system?  :P

    How can people use fake everything? I can't believe people go through that much effort and risk of it not showing up (especially for small personal use amounts). Maybe I don't take it seriously enough.

    Hello OP,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chris Calderone here. I recently had a similar situation happen. Back in April a package didn't arrive. I get with the vendor and the guy had put the right street address, right city, wrong state and wrong zip code. Turns out that my shipping address city also exists in the vendor's fuck up state and he happened to put the correct zip code in for this state. The idiot totally fucked me over and casually says "Aww, brah. I was typing in addresses by hand that night and looked at his state and zip but attached it to your order, lol". I'm thinking, yeah, its real easy for you to sit there and laugh, shit for brains. So I fret and worry big time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I happened to find The Creeper's posts about Mail Recovery Center/Dead Letter Office, the guy is seriously the only expert these forums have on those places and while he certainly doesn't try to make anyone feel better, he does know what he's talking about. He's not going to sugarcoat the truth to save your feelings. He wants you to understand the reality of your mail being x-rayed (if it is a letter) or opened (if it is a package) and that, barring hyper-effective stealth, your drugs will be discovered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, depending on the quantity of drugs a few things may happen. They'll hold it in their seized contraband room, awaiting for that room to get full to the point they must incinerate, they will begin an inquiry into who you as the recipient are following established protocol for all criminal investigations, they will begin an inquiry into where the package came from which could and probably will lead to a dead end. From their they may decide to attempt a dreaded controlled delivery on you and your address but this is largely dependent on the amount of and federal and state scheduling of the drug in question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, Postal Inspector's can easily find any United States citizen very rapidly. Just because a single address on the outside of a package is wrong does not mean the trail goes cold. Heck, doing a basic internet search for myself reveals my current address and a host of other info (thankfully no photos) but PI's have access to state DMV registries, postal records, the records of the hotel you had your contraband shipped to, the major credit card companies and their records, phone records and so on. Will they go through all that trouble for 1 pill of Tramadol? It depends on if that particular Postal Inspector lost a divorce settlement yesterday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In all likelihood, nothing will come of it but heed The Creeper and live and act from now on as if your life has been radically changed. Better to be safe as the Romans do, so they say.

    Then what do you do?  Just because you discovered a way to order drugs and have them delivered through the mail doesn't mean you ought to be doing it. I see many people treating it like it's every citizen's right.  Too many people here lose sight of the fact that this is an illegal endeavor that carries serious consequences if caught.
