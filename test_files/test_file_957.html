    My heart skipped a beat when I saw the telltale green customs tape used to reseal the pacckage. The order was for 100 clonazepam from London, via and online clearnet pharmacy. So I have two questions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. is it common to inspect and let things through anyways (may have helped that it was in original Rx packaging
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Is my address in any way flagged now? Can I still feel safe ordering stuff here?

    If the package got through without a problem, then there is no problem.
    <br/>
    There is no reason as to why your address would be flagged because a package was inspected but still let through.

    I agree. If any were missing that would have meant trouble; since they came through intact, were sent from a pharmacy, &amp; in their original packaging, the inspectors figured that it was either a legitimate transaction or not worth their time due to the quantity (leaning towards the former, since the latter would result in confiscation and a love letter, at least in certain countries).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If that happened to me I would still be cautious for a spell &amp; only order from the same pharmacy or from a trusted SR vendor known for stealth, but I wouldn't consider the address burned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just had to comment since all three of us currently have the same exact karma...

    I noticed the OP has +14/-1 like I did too haha. But now the OP has +14/-2 and I have +15/-1
    <br/>
    No, I didn't -1 anybody, even though it probably appears that way. I only -1 if someone asks a stupid question or makes a stupid / rude comment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In Australia at least, I don't think they "flag" addresses for small seizures. I think if there were several items seized that had a fairly large combined weight then they would look into it. But there must be thousands of letters being seized every week. Customs surely can't watch / flag all of these addresses?
    <br/>
    I think all mail would just go through customs and flagged mailing addresses would be checked at a local post office or sorting centre.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs just seems too big to concentrate on so many little packages. They wouldn't look at each address and check it at customs.

    Don't order International!  Only stay in  the states where it is ILLEGAL for the USPS to open your package.
    <br/>
    If they open your package, then they have broken federal law and its their ass not yours!
    <br/>
    I do not recommend ordering international unless you have no choice.

    There are many things that you can not get domestically/are way over priced. Nearly all raw materials even those used by US pharmaceutical companies are imported from other countries, so that really isn't realistic.  They can get a warrant to open your package and make up any reason they want.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been getting many packages seized lately. It's almost like they pick packages at random and check them in a Mass Spec. I wouldn't worry about this. The green tape "Inspected by DHS Customs and Border Protection" tape I've seen many times, usually if it's something that has legitimate use in the US, even if it is scheduled and doesn't seam like too large of an amount they will let it through.

    Why would they stop a constant supply of information about a bulk seller they want to nab? Giving it back to you only makes everyone seem at peace and lets business go on as usual. They probably fingerprinted and such, collected all they could from the one package, and then let you have your few pills. As stated above, I would at least stay on my toes. But... I am also told that I am paranoid quite a bit. 8)

    Probably not he ordered clonazapam which wherever he ordered it from may or may not be illegal to sell/possess. But it's not like he ordered 500g of clonazapam powder which shows that his is importing raw materials to manufacture or even large quantity of pills. Let's get real, 100 pills really isn't that much of what is it? A schedule III drug? I may be wrong, I didn't look it up but really it's not like oxycodone or quaaludes or something.
