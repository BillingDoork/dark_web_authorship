    Let's say i have a P.O box, and I checked my P.O box this morning to see if my SR package had arrived, but it had not. If I go back to the post office later this afternoon before they close, is there a chance that it would have been delivered? Or is the mail given to the post offices once every day? I only ask because I expected to get my package a few days earlier, and if it does not arrive today, I will be unable to take my product with friends for a few weeks. If I get it today we all have enough time to do it (LSD)

    Sorry Mr X, mail arrives in your town around dawn, and should be sorted by noon. I used to have a company PO so I am speaking specifically of your situation. I know the feeling amigo :/

    Mr.X is not pleased. :( Btw I did end up going back later in the day to check, but obviously to no avail. Thanks for the info though. Its a good fact to know in case i'm ever tempted to check my mailbox twice in one day haha
