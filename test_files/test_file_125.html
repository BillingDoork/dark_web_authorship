    Good evening my name is Rick the son of a bitch and I am from the midwest usa greatest suburbs. No but seriously this would anybody be able to direct me to a guide on buying here? I am very close to my purchase the only thing that is keeping me away is the damn bit coin thing loading so long. I really do not have any idea how to do this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would anyone like to explain to me how this works?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Bit coins
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. silk road
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. the other software I need for the address? I have no idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anybody could walk me through this I would appreciate it, I am a college student who is on a good path, has a job I finished my probation last year for some BS and I really want to do this as safely as possible. I could get anything I want down in the city but the shit is not pure and I hope I can get some real stuff in here. What is the safest way to do this? I live in a condo and the mailbox is like 3 inches by 10 or 9 yall know what I mean will the package fit in that? I cant go to a post office to pick shit up if it's not even in my name. I really need a guide or something.

    Okay Rick,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I, too, am relatively new to SR but not new to tor. This is my first bout in this corner of the deepweb. But all I can say is for you to crawl through the Hidden Wiki and look up some tutorials. They may seem elusive but they are there. You cannot expect everyone on here to painstakingly type out all the details of ordering, shipping, and sending BC's.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check out Paradox's Shipping section on here
    <br/>
    http://mto5z3kx5ydxjrz3.onion.to/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Learn about services such as bitinstant for loading BCs [CAREFUL, OPENWEB]
    <br/>
    https://www.bitinstant.com/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if your bitcoin program is taking too long to sync, connect it directly to your modem instead of a router, or look up the ports to forward and how exactly to do so to ensure you're properly connecting to the required number of peers to synchronize.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS,
    <br/>
    Read an English/Grammar book. Pay attention to the section regarding commas.

    Try to order only from domestic sources. That way you at least don't have to worry about customs.
