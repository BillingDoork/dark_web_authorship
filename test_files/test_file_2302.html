    Hi guys/girls (first post).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've got a question in regards to the shipping of LSD. I've done a bit of research and the general consensus seems to be that LSD is scentless, thus making it hard to detect once shipped. Also, as it is not one of the most commonly taken drugs nowadays I don't think that dogs would be trained to detect it did give off a scent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can anyone or any vendors with any experience shed any light on this?

    Any type of blotter is one of the easiest things to send through the mail. You can send it in a standard letter envelope and it's just paper— no scent, no strange x-ray signature. LSD is probably the safest illicit thing to order on here.

    LSD *when referring to blotter tabs* are just paper with the liquid chemical  dropped in. The chemical will give a scent but because of the properties it will be hard for a dog to locate the source of origin. Personally I think you would be fine mailing it in a regular envelope without even any further precautions. To be honest the blotter sheets are legal and often collectable, they need a warrant to open your mail and just seeing it is a blotter tab does not mean a thing.

    LSD can give of a scent if it is incorrectly synthesized, and the scent given off will be impurities, but dog's are not trained to smell it as it would be difficult it seems all LSD orders from NL are vacuum sealed anyway, just to make sure because of electronic sniffers I guess, I was watching this tv program and they smelt the LSD I was like yea right with the human nose and the woman was seeing horses and shit, I hate the way TV / People portray LSD...

    Most people are NOT ready for that. Most people are still fucking afraid of the dark, when they take hallucinogens.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to see real, three-dimensional visuals like animals and the people you know being transformed into giant alien beings, or the sky turning into rainbows, you are shooting for closer to 400 micrograms and up, with better results in putting yourself in a new and uncomfortable environment. For instance, if you're a basement dweller, out in the woods with some friends overnight, or something like that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course all safety things apply— easier just to stay away from ledges, from water, and from the possibility of meeting people like white christian grandmothers and police officers, if you're not fully confident to handle the dosage of your chosen molecule.

     Of course all safety things apply— easier just to stay away from ledges, from water, and from the possibility of meeting people like white christian grandmothers and police officers, if you're not fully confident to handle the dosage of your chosen molecule.

    One time i taked two tabs of anonymous blotters rated at 350 ug each, so a trip of 700 ug this was the best lsd trip of my life with many many visuals! I dont get many visuals if i take under 300 ug but i think i builded some resistance with the time..

       Any type of blotter is one of the easiest things to send through the mail. You can send it in a standard letter envelope and it's just paper— no scent, no strange x-ray signature. LSD is probably the safest illicit thing to order on here.

      I am pretty sure it has a scent, everything has a scent. But I am wondering if dogs are trained to detect LSD. What do you think?

     LSD can give of a scent if it is incorrectly synthesized, and the scent given off will be impurities, but dog's are not trained to smell it as it would be difficult it seems all LSD orders from NL are vacuum sealed anyway, just to make sure because of electronic sniffers I guess, I was watching this tv program and they smelt the LSD I was like yea right with the human nose and the woman was seeing horses and shit, I hate the way TV / People portray LSD...

    If you want to see an horror documentary about LSD you should see the one about Charles Manson and his "Family", because of bad publicity like this LSD is seen by non-drug users as a terrible drug. This is far away from the truth, LSD is a wonderful drug and it shouldn't be illegal at all..

    Its even still made like albert hoffman did it  . With Secale cornutum it has loads of diffrent alkoloids , like ergotamin, ergotolin and  lysergsyredietylamid (LSD) In some EU country's .  Its still used today for secalealkaloider: ergotoksin, ergometrin og ergotamin true agriculture and controlled.  .The uterus (from Latin "uterus", plural uteri or "uteruses") or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of most mammals including humans. Gynecologists still use it today. Remember hoffman made LSD25 to find a medicine (commercial) as a drug to do abortions/birthcontroll pills.. And today they still use these alkoloids for even migreen and to make the  uterine muscles to contract.  LSD is in a sense legal :&gt; but just for the pharma industry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The french revolution , lysergsyredietylamid was there trigger !!  all the bread was packed with Secale cornutum infested with (LSD).  So I understand why the governments don't want that to happen again. . LSD is in the air . insects even spreads it around .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LSD is legal , just not in the form we prefer. . Thank you SR!!  for making it available to the masses again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now i need some sleep. without sleep and food even LSD is no good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sry if iam rambling , and btw if you dont make LSD based on Secale cornutum but just mix some Rye (Secale cereale) with orange juice or something. then you can smell it.     tired. here is some wikistuff
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LSD is sensitive to oxygen, ultraviolet light, and chlorine, especially in solution, though its potency may last for years if it is stored away from light and moisture at low temperature. In pure form it is a colorless, odorless, and mildly bitter solid.[6] LSD is typically delivered orally, usually on a substrate such as absorbent blotter paper, a sugar cube, or gelatin. In its liquid form, it can also be administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection. LSD is very potent, with 20–30 µg (micrograms) being the threshold dose. New experiments with LSD have started in 2009 for the first time in 40 years. [7]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like they consider to use to LSD25 to cure alcoholics in Norway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So from the the French revolution , to the 50s with CIA trying to mind control ,young hippies. ,,,the fact is. LSD is the cheapest drug to produce on the planet.. and THAT is  a threat.
