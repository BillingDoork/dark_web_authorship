    Information about Australias Main Postal System - Auspost: (Links Below)
    <br/>
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This information is all freely available online, i'm just compiling it for your use - i will update with new information as i find it, or PM me if you find something relevent and i will add the information to the first post with credit to you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    99.1% of Express Post items were delivered on time or early in 2011/12.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AusPost delivers 20 million items to 11 million addresses across Australia every day including 400,000 parcels.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The following items can be sent without showing identification if they weigh less than 500g:
    <br/>
    - Express Courier International prepaid items
    <br/>
    - Express Post International prepaid items
    <br/>
    - Letters that only contain written correspondence or documents and don't need customs documentation
    <br/>
    - Aerogramme or postcards
    <br/>
    - Pre-paid Registered Post International envelopes
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AusPost Addressing Guidelines: (see link below for more detail, applies for international mail also)
    <br/>
    - Typically, the address should be written in three lines:
    <br/>
    - The top line should contain the recipient's name
    <br/>
    - The second to last line should contain the number and name of the street, PO Box or locked bag number (if applicable)
    <br/>
    - The last line should contain the place name (suburb, town etc.) or post office of delivery, state or territory abbreviation and postcode.
    <br/>
    (This line should be printed in capitals without punctuation or underlining, with the postcode put last)
    <br/>
    - For international mail, the country name should be in capitals on the bottom (fourth) line
    <br/>
    - Use the correct postcode (you can use ourÂ  tool to do this)
    <br/>
    - Print clearly using dark ink; preferably black on white. Avoid using red, yellow or orange ink
    <br/>
    - Don't indent or stagger address lines
    <br/>
    - Don't underline any words
    <br/>
    - Include a return address so we can we can return the letter if it can't be delivered. Put your address in the top left corner,
    <br/>
    or on the back flap of the envelope
    <br/>
    - For machine-addressed envelopes, we recommend using clear readable type such as Courier 12 point or 10 pitch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AusPost Packaging hints &amp; tips:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make sure your item arrives safely, it is your responsibility to ensure your item is securely wrapped, with enough cushioning to prevent damage to the item, postal equipment or other mail, or injury to people handling the item. If your item is fragile, perishable, crushable, oddly shaped, or sharp, you should take extra precautions. Liquid, liquefiable or powder articles should also be packed securely. All packed articles should withstand a drop of approximately 1 metre to prevent potential damage or breakage. You can buy padded bags and other secure packaging online or at any Australia Post retail outlet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fragile items (e.g. glass)
    <br/>
    - Wrap each item in tissue paper or newspaper
    <br/>
    - Put them into an inner container and put the inner container into a corrugated cardboard outer container
    <br/>
    - Surround the inner container with cushioning material such as bubble wrap on the top, bottom and all sides to limit movement and protect the item
    <br/>
    - Close the outer container with reinforced tape
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Perishable items (e.g. fruit)
    <br/>
    - Place items in paper mache trays
    <br/>
    - Put the trays in a heavy cardboard outer container lined with absorbent slabs
    <br/>
    - Enclose the address and return address, and then seal the container with reinforced tape
    <br/>
    - Put the address, return address and the word 'PERISHABLE' on the top and on one side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Crushable items (eg. drawings and photos)
    <br/>
    - Protect the front and back of the frame with strong, rigid material larger than the frame to minimise chances of breakage
    <br/>
    - Place soft, protective material such as bubble wrap between the frame and the rigid material to reduce pressure on the glass
    <br/>
    - Put the item in a box in a heavy cardboard outer container
    <br/>
    - Enclose the address and return address, and then seal the container with reinforced tape
    <br/>
    - Mark the item as 'FRAGILE' on the outer packaging with the address
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sharp items (e.g. garden shears)
    <br/>
    - Tightly roll newspaper around the blades and secure with reinforced tape. The newspaper should extend about 100 millimetres beyond the tip
    <br/>
    - Put the address and return address on a slip of paper, and then tape it to the item
    <br/>
    - Place the item in a corrugated cardboard outer container and surround the item with cushioning material such as bubble wrap to limit movement
    <br/>
    and protect the item
    <br/>
    - Tape all seams and wrap the item tightly with reinforced tape.

    I would not trust parcel lockers,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "You can collect your parcel anytime within 48 hours of receiving an email and SMS notification advising your parcel is available for collection."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only 48 hours to collect package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the package was suspect of holding drugs it'd be easy for LEO to survey the locker waiting for you to come in that 48 hour window.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Controlled delivery imminent. Would not risk.

    I know it's been covered to death but I can't find a whole lot of Aussie examples of a CD. Was it to a PO Box / house address / parcel locker / drug den? Be good to hear the story... Main question is was it done by Aust Post or LEO? How long till they raided or did they just whip em out right there and then?

    I dont think there is any holy grail for receiving parcels from overseas. It is the same risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they intercept visa customs and it is a decent amount, they will surely replace it at wait till you pick it up / collect it using auspost staff, cctv and parcel scanning technology.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think in this day and age of surveillance I wouldn't be doing to a fucking PO Box or Locker for shit. But that is just me...

    Using a PO box or locker service is worse than your own address. There's far less deniability.

     ......Parcel Lockers! This seems to be very interesting indeed, you register a name and details on the auspost website, when they get a parcel matching the address you are given to use, they ship it into a parcel locker for 24/7 pickup. I have not tried this myself yet, I would like some more input from others about it... what do you think? good for SR use? (i dont think there is anything stopping you from registering a dodgy name ;) there is no mention of having to show ID at these new parcel lockers). Potential downside: Can only accept 'Parcel' deliveries, no letters. Have a good read through the Parcel Lockers page (link below).

    Yes, I looked into this too, but the inability to accept letters made me move on. When you register, you need to provide a name, address, email address and phone number. The idea is that they SMS you when a package arrives. I don't know if they will attempt a verification of your details. There is however an aspect that would stop me using it for SR or any non SR deliveries and that is the issue oncharging the delivery/courier service. If you read through the terms and conditions, some delivery companies will be charged an extra fee for using the service and if they refuse the package is not delivered. For local deliveries or anything sent though the Auspost system its not a problem.

    The guy hardly glanced at my ID, didn't even take it off the counter &amp; I'm pretty sure that on the form they did not even ask for full DL number, just the last 4-6 numbers... Didn't setup my SMS notification correctly thoughÂ  &gt;:(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many PO Boxes have 24 hour access &amp; are positioned in a way that makes them impossible to stake out without hanging a big red PIG sign around your neck. I don't see them being a problem but am looking forward to using a private PO company one day.

    The problem I've found at least with the PO that I have my box with, they wont' deliver mail to people not registered to the PO BOX. The will only allow up to 3 names otherwise you have to get another po box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also some post offices are located at unis, so if u dont need to register who is attached to the po box it would be good to get one from the uni based po box. As I know of one uni where the po box are on the outside of the post office in a public open area. So it would be quite hard for cops to stake out the place covertly. This one would be good for use, so long as I said its not restricted by the post office by name.

    Not only that but you also have to type in your specific code to get the locker to open. It would be incredibly easy to identify someone after this happens.

    Well, the point is, you never know. Receiving packages in this way just makes it easier for you to get busted. The terminals most likely have cameras in them (like ATMs) so when you type in your code they take a photo of you. The locations also have cameras pointing outside. It would not be difficult to find out who you are.

    My take on it is that if LE want to know who you are, it matters not weather you use a real address, friends address, PO box or parcel locker.
    <br/>
    The methods exists technologically to trace an address to a specific person. Like Falk said.... would they bother for a small amount of drugs? Its the legal side that is most significant. Can they PROVE a parcel is intended for you. An anonymous address has only one benefit. It means the vendor does not know where you live.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I said. Just my take on it.

    Better yet, can you give me proof that they don't have cameras in them? That would be a lot more helpful to everyone. I would be very surprised if they didn't given how easy it is to install cameras and that the footage could be used to solve issues anyone has when they claim a package has gone missing. The same way banks use ATM cameras to check who has taken money out of an account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem is that it will be difficult to know for sure whether these boxes contain cameras until someone is busted or someone from Australia Post answers the question. Worse yet, if you are busted using one of these boxes under a fake name you will most likely go to jail for 6 to 12 months.

    Are you being serious? You are walking up to a machine and punching in a number that only you know. You give away your identity by letting others know your location and the time you will be at that location.

    It is almost no different than getting a notice to pick up a package from inside the post office and there have been a number of cases where that has led to an arrest.

    If you are an Australian vendor and don't have the parcels/letters demention cardboard cutout, you should casually ask for one next time you are in the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is a rectangular cardboard cutout that you can test your letters/parcel size to see how much they will cost to post. If they can't fit through the slot, they will cost 6 bucks or something, if they can they will only be 1 or 2 dollars.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The post office usually has extras, because they want people to be able to check before they leave home. That way they can slap stickers on all of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you don't use the cardboard cutout, and just drop it in a red box, you might get an unfriendly visit from your postman saying "THIS BLOODY THING WONT FIT IN YOUR LETTERBOX, WHATS IN THIS ANYWAY?!" (has happened before!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The SIZE of the letter/parcel is everything. As long as it is as small or as big as it is being sent, you shouldnt have issues!.. Hope that made sense?

    This ^^
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive checked that cut out and it makes perfect sense to use it when posting letters. See if you can buy it (with cash off course) if they dont give them out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also regarding envelopes for posting 5-10 grams, you can buy prepaid ones, they come in bulk.
    <br/>
    From what I understand as long as your letter does not weigh too much as in not heavy like a small parcel and fits inside the dimensions, it should be ok to post as a letter.
    <br/>
    Anyone disagree?

    With respect to the earlier discussion about AusPost 24/7 Parcel Lockers, it is worth noting that I have spoken to vendors on SR and other sites (BMR/Atlantis) and they confirm that they have sent to Parcel Lockers without incident.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to re-open this issue.Â  The Parcel Lockers have been around now for more than a year.Â  It should be reasonable to get data.Â  I am currently conducting a test on sending express C5's (which is a common size for these purposes, as it is below any ID requirements but can still hold up to a DVD box) to parcel lockers in my city.Â  I am using fake name; I found that the registration requires that you input a name and a residential address, but there is no attempt to match the two.Â  As long as a valid residential address is chosen (trivial today using google maps and satellite images to identify suburban houses and connect them with valid postal addresses), then you can register for parcel lockers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I said, I will be conducting a small experiment over the next few weeks to see how effective these are at getting C5's and even fat letters around -- note that this is already outside guidelines, because they aren't supposed to be used for "letters/standard mail" or for "express post letters", but the experience of the vendors reported above indicates that they are nonetheless effective for this purpose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will report back to the forum when appropriate with my findings.Â  I will also mention it in the Aussie Thread.
