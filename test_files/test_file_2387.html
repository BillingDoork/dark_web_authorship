    So some time ago (I won't say when) I received a package that had a yellow sticker on the front saying 'Opened by Australia Post for Inspection by Quarantine'.
    <br/>
    The box was damaged, and clearly had been roughly opened, and the contents sifted through. Inside there was a pamphlet basically saying Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service screening service which uses detector dogs and x-rays indicated there was an item of quarantine concern in my package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This particular package was something entirely innocent and a type of product I have had shipped to me hundreds of times over the last 10-15 years, I don't see what a dog or x-ray would have found suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think it is just random, or that the outside of the box looked a bit dodgy to start with (it did), or that they're starting to watch my mail more closely? I have had something from SR not arrive in the last few months as well, so probably grabbed, but I have also had things from SR show up since I got this letter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else ever seen anything like this, or had quarantine tell them they've had something confiscated? I didn't think they sent letters if they took something in Aus, and I'm still not convinced they do.

    No it said that upon inspection, they found nothing suspicious and repacked it. Very generic leaflet, probably happens multiple times a day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thats probably a good point that they'll send a letter for things that people wouldn't necessarily know were illegal and not for illicit substances.

    I have had 2 or 3 for stuff i've ordered on eBay. It's usually when the package looks like it was taped together with a potato.

    I had exact same thing happen.

    See this thread.

    <br/>
    My opinion;
    <br/>
    This is just routine "bio-security", they didnt find anything and you are ok. ie not flagged
    <br/>
    But;
    <br/>
    A package going missing I assume they found drugs and have taken them. ie flagged
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What happens after being flagged is a guess, everyone just guesses how they handle it. My guess under trafficable they just bin it and flag you. If flagged and they keep finding drugs to confiscate, they will prolly bust you. If it is a trafficable amount, I think there is good chance you will have your door kicked in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS
    <br/>
    You will prolly have some clown pm saying they are 100% on to you, they will come get you sooner or latter, etc The guy is a dickhead and wouldnt clarify his circumstances, I suspect he got busted for being a peanut IRL or continued sending to flagged address or is deliberately scaremongering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are a lot weird cunts here, with weird ideas, just be careful, even long time posters could easily be plants or troublemakers.

    Great, thanks for the info! I typically only order small amounts for personal use for me and sometimes a couple of friends so the lost package was not very much, I'm assuming nobody would even bother chasing me for it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think I'll just ignore it as a coincidence for now. No need to get over-paranoid.

    It simply means that their mutt or scanner picked up an organic trail in your package and they had to open it. If nothing was removed then remember that with Aus policy of "plants will kill us all" these things are issued left right and center on a huge scale. Its only to cover their asses if your package is missing something or you think its damaged by them. They dont keep tabs of who gets one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did however have some synthetics taken off me a couple years back but it was on plant material and sent straight from NZ.... kinda stupid but if i proved to them what seeds and plants was in the "pot pouri" and had it gamma radiated i would have got it back haha I let it be destroyed.

    Please don't assume. I'd suggest you get everything out of your house. If I'm wrong, then what have you lost?

    Interesting.. i've had some goods come through (in the most terrible packaging might i add) when i received it, it had that sticker "opened by AUS post for customs"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i couldn't believe it, i was like fuck my stuff didn't arrive.. so anyway once i got inside i opened it up and there was a letter from customs saying bla bla customs has opened this, customs looks for suspicious items such as drugs and weapons.. this pamplet was shoved into the folded up paper, which when i opened this my goodies were there..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so they obviously saw it.. there's just no way they didn't.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i've had numerous things arrive to my address afterwards, so i dunno..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a friend of a friend met someone who works for customs at a party and they were saying how for such little amounts it's too much hassle for them to report it so sometimes they just let it slide..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    maybe that's what happened in my case but who knows lol.

    I forgot to mention earlier, the leaflet was marked as from the department of agriculture. So yeah it does seem like they were mostly looking for pests and plants.
    <br/>
    I'm not convinced that small amounts of drugs they would let slide because its too much paperwork, especially after they had already torn it open. But you never know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I always was curious if plant diseases could travel in on weed? If so probably a good reason to not get it OS.

    I have had AQIS  notices at least 30 times in the last 10 years. Mostly for no reason at all.

    <br/>
    I have also had herbal teas and other herb based products (even in capsules) that are non-scheduled get coniscated for bio-security reasons.

    I have successfully argued to get then back once.

    This is standard operating procedure and very unlikely to be anything to do with SR related shenanigans.
