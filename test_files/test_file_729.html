    I am planning to make my first semi-large purchase soon, and due to the incriminating amount that I would be ordering, I would feel safer sending it to a P.O box, instead of my home address. I have no idea how to set one up, and I don't want to seem sketchy when I go to the post office, so I was hoping on getting some advice on here before I go do it. This was my plan so far:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1.Go to a post office the next town over from where I live
    <br/>
    2.Ask to set up a P.O box
    <br/>
    3. Use my real name and address to set it up( will it seem strange to them that im not getting a P.O box in my own town?)
    <br/>
    4. Order my package PGP encrypted to my P.O box
    <br/>
    5.Casually walk in and grab my package when it arrives.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IS this correct? I am told that I should have other mail sent to my P.O box as well, but unfortunately I do not have the resources for this. If I only use my P.O box to pick up orders from Silk Road (once or twice a month at most, mostly small amounts), will this arouse suspicion? Please give me some advice on how I should handle this

    As far as it seeming strange setting one up out of town A.) Lots of people do this if they have a temporary residence that's far enough away from their legal address where they'd rather drive down the road and B.) They're not gonna bat an eyelash anyways
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regarding sending dummy mail, you DO in fact have the resources to get other packages sent to the box.  If you have an internet connection, you can find tons of SUPER FLY SHIT like coupons, free product samples, and of course FREE-AS-FUCK BIBLES that companies will send you.  I like to find places that are close to my vendor, especially if they're international, that can send me random goodies to make it even less shady.  Also, if you can, find something to ship that won't fit in your box if you bought the small one so you can see what that process is like.  Some post offices leave a key in your box that opens a locker, while others leave a note and you have to walk up to the counter.  Also, my notes always have the box checked that say "requires signature" as well as "did not fit in box", but I've only been asked to sign once.

    Your getting larger than normal amounts, then invest in a dead drop.

    <br/>
    If it gets seized you dont want it linked to you in any way, shape or form.

    <br/>
    Invest in security and have piece of mind.

    If its been compromised you just walk away, burn it and try again.

      very good advice, thank you. but i feel uncomfortable if i have to go to the front desk and sign for things. I've heard from various sources that no matter what, you should never sign for your silk road package, because that is like a confession that you ordered drugs. I'm no expert in law, so if im wrong please correct me, but signing for packages is just wrong in general. From what ive heard at least
      <br/>

    thank you very much for your advice. Getting other mail from countries that i order from is a good idea. What do I do if I am asked to sign for a package though? You said you had to sign for one before, but isn't that a bad idea? Once you sign for it, isn't that pretty much like admitting that you are the owner of the package? I've heard from other threads that it is a bad idea to sign for things
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S I am also curious what a "dead drop" is as well

    A dead drop is a place where you can send your illegal items and not have it linked back to you in case things were to go south.

    Your home address is not a dead drop.

    ok, so i just went to the post office today and asked about setting up a P.O box. It costs about 30 bucks for  a small box for 6 months (ugh). However, i am a little worried about the size of the P.O boxes. I saw them through the window and they appear to be very small. I didn't get a chance to see the inside of the boxes, so i'm hoping they have a lot of space on the inside. Can anybody who owns a small sized  P.O box in the U.S let me know what sized packages can fit in there? I'm hoping every post office has similar sized boxes. The package that i'm planning on ordering wouldnt be that big i dont think, but i'm pretty sure it will be bigger than the size of a regular letter

    Hey, well since i've never had a reason to rent a P.O box before, and the only reason i'm getting one  now is to have  drugs sent to me in the mail, obviously i'm going to be as cautious as I can. I feel a lot better consulting with other people that know for sure what theyre doing, then just blindly trying to figure things out myself (even though id probably be fine either way). I didn't want to sound too inquisitive by saying things like "what are the dimensions of your P.O boxes?" or "do you think your small boxes could fit a package containing 25 grams worth of MDMA?" While I was there because I didn't expect the boxes to be as small as they were, and I feel I would've had to explain my reasons for asking about their exact sizes, but I couldn't think of one in such a short notice. I also have no idea exactly how big my vendors package is going to be, since I have never ordered such a large amount. I was trying to be as normal and nonchalant as possible. Honestly, it seems like everyone who uses a P.O box for bulk seems to have no problem, so maybe I'm being a bit too paranoid, but better safe then sorry right? I'm sorry if I offended you, O great and wise druglord. Please don't send your hitmen after me. Your vast knowledge of P.O boxes greatly eclipses mine. I am not worthy to even look upon your comment. Please forgive my eyes, my liege.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S: thank you everyone for your help. I feel a lot more confident that my order will arrive without a problem. Just to be on the safe side, I think i'm going to get the next biggest sized box. 50 or 60 bucks to have anything I want mailed to me safely for six months sounds like a decent deal to me lol. Ill let you guys know how everything goes in a few weeks once everything has been finished.  :)

    Apology excepted because I am offended.

    I am offended at your type that come on here and post/regurgitate stupid fucking senseless questions.
    <br/>
    I loath it so much it ruins my SR experience.
    <br/>
    Fucking kids jump on here and post shit without a/thinking for just 2 mins about their problem and b/ DO NOT EVEN BOTHER TO USE THE FUCKING SEARCH ENGINE... just for 5 min at least try and find some thread about whatever you are looking for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS I am sure you are a nice kid in real life so I am going to help you out with one of your problems by asking a question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You just rented the BIGGEST most EXPENSIVE PO box you could find because those little standard envelope PO boxes do not look large enough for your huge order of 25g of MDMA. OK what happens if the vendor ships it in a parcel that still wont fit in your Biggest most Expensive PO box??  If you cannot figure it out or find it here already on the forums I suggest you go and ask the nice lady behind the counter at the post office. I am sure she will not think you are a big time drug trafficker

     2.Ask to set up a P.O box
     <br/>
     3. Use my real name and address to set it up( will it seem strange to them that im not getting a P.O box in my own town?)
     <br/>
     4. Order my package PGP encrypted to my P.O box
     <br/>
     5.Casually walk in and grab my package when it arrives.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     IS this correct? I am told that I should have other mail sent to my P.O box as well, but unfortunately I do not have the resources for this. If I only use my P.O box to pick up orders from Silk Road (once or twice a month at most, mostly small amounts), will this arouse suspicion? Please give me some advice on how I should handle this

    You can just rent a bigger box so that you can go after hours to pick up your mail. If the box is too big they put a slip in your box and hold the package behind the counter. That might be a bit nerve racking to go to the counter to pick it up. Just make sure you rent a big enough box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You might also look into a private mail box place or a UPS to see which you are most comfortable with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a thought but you might want to play it safer and start small till you get the feel of things.You could get scammed or worse.

    people get p o boxes all the time to only get packages form ebay and shit..

    a lot of people dont want some stranger knowing where they live.. its not odd to only have random boxes sent to it..

    as for the size dont worry they will leave a key to get into a bigger box..

    Hey Op... I hope you did not get a bigger box like some of the suggestions here.
    <br/>
    You say one or 2 deliveries a month??
    <br/>
    Those bigger boxes are generally used by people who get bulk mail... you know... 100+letters a week.
    <br/>
    How suspect would you look having a big box and only getting 1 or 2 deliveries per month.

    <br/>
    damn mail man just leaves it outside on the steps and im scared someone will steal it mind if i use ur address ill give u some money if u need me to..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    or something idk.. i wouldnt do it ..
    <br/>
    another way ive been thinking of. is ..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    have a gf or someone babysit for someone.. or watch over an elderly person
    <br/>
    find out when the mail comes.. then start ordering express packages while u are there and just simply put them in the trunk and leave when ur done watching them..
    <br/>
    dont have it in your name.. and boom ur golden pony boy..

    Honestly, I like the private mail box places if you could find a good one. I used to have one at a mom and pop place. Man, I wish the place was still around. It would be perfect for SR. I knew all the employees there so I would know if anything was strange and could stay away.

    thanks for all the advice so far. It seems like there are a lot of different ways to go about this. I've been busy the past few days, so i haven't gotten around to filling out the P.O box application sheet yet. I've been dealing with some bitinstant bullshit. Ill ask the guy at the post office if their small boxes will fit things like textbooks in them, since theres a college in that town, and I look like I could be a student there. If the P.O box will fit a textbook, it'll fit some large SR packages I feel. I'm gonna do a test run by sending something small, like a few hits of LSD to the box, to make sure there are no problems. Then I'll make the real purchase. I;m feeling more and more confident the more I think about it. Unfortunately I don't know anybody that would let me deliver unknown mail to their house that won't ask me what I'm sending to them. Besides, if I got caught by the police, my dead drop would get in trouble too, and they probably wouldn't wanna be friends with me after that

    I like the idea about dead drops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I will not have 100+ letters in a week. But I will have 500g till 2kg of marihuana and that is making me paranoid. It would be good if I could stay anonymous. For any amounts handling over 2g in my country I can get up to 8 years. That is risk which I can not take, but I need way to reduce the risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I ordered first package, I received a letter from postman that I have a package waiting in my postal office. I had to go there and sign to get the package. If I have to do this every time I receive 100g+ packages, shit man...I can get busted very easily.

    wow that is a really good idea. I'm prob just gonna stick with the P.O box for now though, since most things ill be getting are small amounts, with an occaisional bulk purchase every few months or so. If I ever become a drug overlord, i'll definately follow your advice

     wow that is a really good idea. I'm prob just gonna stick with the P.O box for now though, since most things ill be getting are small amounts, with an occaisional bulk purchase every few months or so. If I ever become a drug overlord, i'll definately follow your advice

    I think it will not work for me, because in my country the postage settings are different, but maybe I should seek for other options.

    hey this is a stupid question, but I just went to the post office and set everything up. The guy I talked to was very friendly and answered all my questions. He definately did not suspect I was using the P.O bix for illegal activities haha. I forgot to ask him one thing though. When I put my address down, do I need to put the address of the post office, or just the P.O box number. The example on my sheet looks like:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    John Doe
    <br/>
    P.O box 6969
    <br/>
    Anytown, anywhere
    <br/>
    89766
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im assuming i dont need the street address of the post office but I just want to make sure

    Hey, this is what the community forums are for, helping each other out. I'll gladly share my experiences with a nervous noob in the future if they're having the same problem as I am. I'd rather ask a stupid question and feel dumb for a moment, then to not ask a question at all and end up having a package lost in the mail, or being arrested. Although i'm sure you're one of the smartest people on Silk road, you don't have a very likeable online personality. Your probably ugly IRL too. I mean this in the nicest possible way. Even though you've been nothing but rude and hostile towards me since i started this thread, I'll be happy to  be the bigger man and help you out with things that I'm good at, such as proper manners, and how to not be ugly. Just send me a PM and i'll be glad to help you out. I don't want to get off topic with this thread, so i'm going to stop responding to these mean and childish posts after this. A wise man once said, "Arguing over the internet is like competing in the special olympics, even if you win, you're still retarded". I've basically finished setting everything up with my P.O box so far, so thank you all for your help, even though some of my questions were probably a little silly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S Does anyone know of any websites where I can get free mail from other countries sent to my P.O box? Right now it would look good to receive mail from Germany and canada right now so if anyone knows of any sites that give out free shit from those countries let me know. Ill look around myself and post the sites here if I find them. Id feel safer if i picked up some legal mail alongside my drugs when i went to the post office

    I haven't used it in a long time but I think there is a site called freebe.com or something like that. Has everything like free pens, perfume, magazine all kinds of promotional items. You will also get a ton of junk mail along with every free item.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't worry about questions. Much better to ask a question than make a bad mistake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope things go well for you. Stay safe.

    I was being cynical... not mean... not hostile.... totally truthful, which is alot more than others on here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I truly believe that if you cannot open a po box OR write down your PObox address properly you should not be ordering drugs online.
    <br/>
    So you can twist my comments to however you perceive them. I however perceive them as helping you in such a way that I am not holding your hand leading you
