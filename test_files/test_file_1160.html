    Unfortunately, the post office not scanning tracking labels is a very common problem. There's an entire thread devoted to post office ineptitude in scanning tracking labels on the ebay forums. It's entirely possible that your tracking label won't be scanned until the package arrives at the destination post office. So the only tracking you'll see is for actual delivery.

    The real problem with the Form 400s is: How the hell to get a hold of them anonymously?!?!

    I got a hole book or roll 500 labels and i only asked for 12 because I bought  12 of the $5.60 stamps but she gave me a hole roll
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I went down and acted like i was getting stamps and the  label 400 for my grandmother (I just acted dumb and read off a list from my Phone )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the mail lady even said they are not suppose to hand them out   (I told her I have no clue I,m just picking this stuff up for my grandmother)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if she would have said something like you can order them online (I would have said my grandmother does not have a computer nor would she now how to work one)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if they ask what she is mailing (I would just say I have no clue )

    There's our answer, send senior citizens into the post office to pick up #400 labels.  If they tell the seniors to order them online, they say they don't have a computer and don't know how to work that internets lol!

    13 Ounce Rule applies only to stamped(as in postage stamps)mail that is dropped in a USPS blue box.  If you're not dropping your packages there would be no reason to use your own Label 400.  If you do drop you can definitely use labels you procured on your own.

    "Delivery status information is not avail. for your item via this web site" &lt;---- If you are getting this massage when trying to track a domestic package you are most likely entering an incorrect tracking number.  The error message pertains to pieces of international mail that can only be tracked via EMS tracking.  It would be normal if you tried to track international mail that didn't support tracking.
