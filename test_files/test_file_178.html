    A Scottsbluff man and woman accused of receiving delivery of LSD and other drugs through the U.S. Postal Service were sentenced Wednesday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Andrew Vanderveen, 22, and his girlfriend Sarah Trook, 20, were charged in June after authorities learned of a delivery of LSD via the U.S. Postal Service. According to an arrest affidavit, the U.S. Postal inspector and a special agent with Homeland Security investigations conducted a controlled delivery of an envelope containing a half-gram of LSD to a post office box owned by Vanderveen. WING investigators observed Vanderveen pick up the envelope, which contained 50 squares of LSD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After authorities arrested Vanderveen, he admitted to possessing other quantities of LSD, hashish, marijuana and mescaline and psilocybin mushrooms. Authorities attempted to locate the drugs, which Trook had allegedly recovered from the residence and attempted to hide at a friend’s home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police recovered three grams of marijuana, quantities of LSD, five grams of hashish and 68 grams of mushrooms.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to court documents, Trook pled no contest to a charge of being an accessory to attempted possession of a controlled substance, a Class IV felony. Prosecutors dismissed four charges of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver, a Class III felony, in a plea agreement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    She received a sentence of two years probation, Scotts Bluff County Attorney Doug Warner said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vanderveen also received a sentence of probation on a charge of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver, a Class IV felony. Prosecutors dismissed three other counts of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver, all Class III felonies, as part of a plea agreement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vanderveen has been sentenced to serve three years probation.

    such low weights, you have to wonder if they were perhaps trying to make an example out of these two.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i mean, you could walk into thousands of homes across America and find exactly that set of substances in similar weights...honestly, it's confusing why LE would pursue them, other than to send a message to others that if you buy anything in any weight at all, you can be arrested and prosecuted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    seriously though, you have to ask what sort of danger these two posed to society?

    It could be that LE is facing increasing pressure to crack down on mail order drugs. While I have no stats, I bet that because of SR, BMR and increased use of the internet to get drugs, there are a lot more small orders going through the mail. They may not be able to shut down SR, but if they pursue the smaller quantities, they can scare people away from using it.

    Controlled delivery to a p.o. box? Not to be the uber-naive newb here, but I was feeling a bit better reading all the "don't sign and you're fine" stuff on the forums. This makes it sound like delivering the envelope to the p.o. box and then watching and waiting for pickup was enough.

    Bear in mind I've never actually been on the receiving end of a controlled delivery, but as I understand it: yes, that's incorrect.  Apparently they sometimes wait around for 10 or 15 minutes because frequently someone else shows up to take delivery of the just-arrived drugs (I can't recall my source for that info though).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You don't have to sign for it -- just have to more or less take ownership of the package.  Picking it up and walking away with it suggests you own it and expected it -- that's good enough for them in most cases I think.

    Maybe it ripped open during transit.  There's a lot of machinery involved with sorting mail.  Happened to me once.  Thankfully I'm a paranoid nut and won't order from any vendor that doesn't stealth the contents well enough to get away with it falling out at some postal inspector's feet.

    this idiot admitted to having other drugs.. my guess is that this fuck got cought and didnt write return to sender on the package..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they pulled his dumb ass over and he freaked out and started talking saying yeah its min and i have more.. fucking clown..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    he couldve picked it up at midnight when only the hallway was open (at least thats how it is at my place)
    <br/>
    then would of been clear of any of this bs..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    either way he got cought yeah.. but he also didnt handle it right prolly.. shipping was prolly shit.. OR maybe even a old partner or friend of theres snithced and told them it was coming..  all in all im not worried about this..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    JUST ANOTHER CASE OF A UNEDUCATED FOOL RECIVEING DRUGS.. NOT THE FIRST IVE SEEN ON HERE NOT GUNNA BE THE LAST...
    <br/>
    <br/>

    This is why in some ways a PO box is worse than a home address. If a package is placed in your mail box and you get the mail, you can bring it inside with the rest of the mail and claim you were going to have it returned to sender, but obviously you needed to put a note on it before you stuck it back in the mailbox. When a package is placed in a PO box, if you don't immediately take it to the clerk and you walk out of the post office with it, you've undeniably taken ownership of it. Basically, there's more plausible deniability with a home address, since you have to go out of your way to pick up mail from a PO box and leave with it, while you're more of a passive recipient of the mail that gets stuck in a home mailbox.

    geez.. the more I read about these things, the less I want to keep pullng the trigger.. and I kinda hate the fact that I went ahead and placed my first NL to US order (for a tiny handful of beans) from a reputable vendor who based on their feedback, all have been receiving and some in the USA.. i usually order from UK or Germany.. once I receive these packages without any trouble, im going to count my blessings and be glad Ive enjoyed the road while it was at its prime..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway, seems like it was delivered to a town with a population of 15,000 people.. no wonder his chances are higher to get caught.. i live in a suburban city of 250k+ people just in my city and pushing closer to the millions if you count the entire metro area... so hmm.. maybe dont order if you live in a rural or small town...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    again, kinda curious how they found the package..

    They don't divulge much information as to how LE learned about the order but it's as feasible as any other theory to assume one of his customers got popped on a charged and then snitched him off. Any LE watching him make trips to the PO Box would be a dead ringer give away. I mean how else could something as 'under the radar' as acid hits be found in the mass movement of all that mail.

    Considering DHS was involved, this order likely came through customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DHS only does drug stuff through ICE which stands for "Immigration and Customs Enforcement"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My money is was the delivery was *not* domestic. Which always increases risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Secondly, 50 tabs is beyond personal amounts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thirdly, he's an idiot for admitting to the other drugs. Young newbie.

    First off, this _kid_ forgot his 5th Amendment rights. When you receive your package, you immediately make a funny face like "Wtf is this shit?" You go inside and write 'Return to sender' on it, and leave it by your front door, or even put it back in your mailbox, assuming it's a box you can recover it from later on. (Mr?Ms Post/wo/man won't be back for a minimum of 22 house from it's delivery.)  If they immediately swarmed him, you bite your lips to keep that mouth from opening up and hope your GF would do the same. Only open it for you lawyer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He didn't sign, and if anything he could have left it in the mailbox, gone back outside and written "return to sender" on it without even bringing it in the house. (If I'm not mistaken, a mailbox in the U.S. is Federal Property. Had he left it there and not brought it inside, it would have remained in Federal possession.) Best believe I drive around and scan the immediate area of my neighborhood before I think twice about opening that mailbox. "Oh what's that blank white car doing up the street with the guy in sunglasses posted up? Well shit. Won't be touching the mailbox for a few days." Postman won't take it back unless you write RTS on it, so it's safe to leave in the mailbox for a while. I've left unwanted ads in my box for weeks to test it. They never took them back. Just stayed there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In a sense, this article spooks me. I'm sure it may have that effect on even some experienced SR consumers. But also I know I'm not that retarded to handle the situation so poorly as this kid did. But then again I have dealt with cops/been to jail before. Sounds like they swooped in and he figuratively crouched down, held his hands up in defense, and spilled everything instantly. Maybe he deserves it. Just think if he were to become a vendor some day? I'd rather be scammed than someone that incompetent ship product to my real address. Those are the kind of idiots that don't even encrypt their hard drives.

    Sounds like LEO was tipped off about drug shipments to his PO BOX, unless the vendor he got it from was explain-ably stupid in packaging it.  Or maybe he's just a victim of a random search at customs.  I do feel for him, a mess over a half sheet of acid.  Although he did indeed fuck up on many points.

    If the weight measurement is actually correct, then I'm sure we can all agree that this is an assload of Lucy...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "50 squares" may well mean 50 sheets. @ 100 blotters per sheet, each blotter will be 100mics which is about the average for a decent tabs these days.

    Didn't see the point of him hiding his other gear at another place if he was just gona tell cops about it anyway.

    Hello everyone I'm new to SR but I've been lurking reading everything I can trying to see if SR is past its prime after the GAWKER article.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think I know my shit when it comes to acid. I want to go over this story as non-biased as I can to possibly find out how these two were caught. The news article is also not saying a word has to how it was detected, because that would just inform the people shipping it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, my thoughts on this. I looked up the story myself to double check what the OP said. The article stated that the guy ordered 0.5g of LSD. That is an insane amount of acid. Doing the calculation if you used 100ug per dose which is standard, half a gram would result in 5,000 doses!!!! Worth over $22,000!!!! That is total BULLSHIT. I know the laws about LSD and the law that was passed in 1965 stated that the sentence depends on the weight of the LSD. The whole reason why they put acid on blotters was not only for easier production, but because it was lighter than sugar cubes! 50 blotters is a lot but it could easily be considered dealing amount level.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok, well the main point of contention is how did they know he was getting the package? Now this is only my opinion here and I'm also new. From looking at the current listings most of it comes from Europe. Its very likely that the package was set aside by customs, and it was probably easy to find in the package. I think that the seller did not ship this very well and when it got set aside at customs it was easily found.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I assume its bad to talk about stealth methods on the forums?? I have some really good ideas for shipping LSD that would be impossible to tell unless the tested every square inch of the package.

    Yeah, don't publicly state any ideas you have.  Who knows, people may already be using them.  The thing is that as far as the USA goes, they can easily get a warrant.  I've read that the only thing it takes is the word of a postal inspector saying to a judge that "it looks suspicious, we have to open it," and the judge goes "sure, here."  That's the picture in my head from what I've read on the subject at least, take it for what it's worth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So examining every inch would be a waste of their time.  Either it's suspicious and they get a warrant, or it isn't and they deliver it like any other mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Red flags: package containing liquid.  Uneven weight distribution.  Tape sealing the package.  Hand written labels.  Misspellings.  Addressed to an individual, from an individual.  Shipped form a zip code different than the return address zip code.  Etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I may be wrong on some of this, but for what it's worth, I personally believe 100% in everything stated in this post.  The problem is that they don't exactly come out and tell us this, so basically, it may be misinformation.  I don't think so, but that's just me.

    Maybe they have calculated the total weight of the 50 squares plus the vacuum sealing... Otherwise, half a gram of L would make each of those 50 squares a 10,000ug hit!

    Dude read my post. Police are not smart enough to do titrations to find how many moles of a compound are present. They weigh the paper, and just guess about how much could be on the paper. Two people in their early 20's in a 15K person town do not have $22K dollars to spend, I'd take those odds to Vegas any day of the week.

    It doesn't make any sense... ??? how can they charge you on false quantities? It's like authorities will find a young cannabis plant inside your house with no flowers at all, and weigh the whole plant including the soil and the pot and then say: "you got a total amount of 5kg of marijuana, you'll be charged on massive possession of illegal substance for trading purposes..."  ???
    <br/>
    I don't know what's the procedure in other countries, but in my country, the authorities must calculate the net weight of the illegal substance...

    Ahh it seems everyone is confused in here, so I can clear things up. Without going too deep into personal details, I can just say that I know a thing or two about United States federal law and leave it at that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is assuming the sting was on a federal scale, and not just local LEA that got them. Which it probably was considering USPS is a federal entity. In addition to the different Classes of Felonies, they are 'rated' on levels as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It levels up to 43 to be exact. Also any past prosecutions related to drugs weighs against them and can affect the level ("Criminal History Category".) To gauge how it levels, I specifically remember that Fentanyl is a minimum level 32 Felony.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For instance: say possessing 10g of heroin may be a Level 32 felony, which would result in 101 to 150 months in prison.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now if proven intent to distribute, add, say, +5 levels. I don't know off the top of my head the U.S.S.C. textbook amounts for the small additions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now if proven you killed someone (committed homicide) in a situation directly related to that heroin, add another +5 or +10 levels.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Say you had 2 prior convictions to having been in possession of heroin, this may add 10 levels right off the start.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All the levels do is add jail time, probation, fines, etc. Your punishment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now with LSD, and other chemicals dosed in the micrograms, especially, it gets REALLY fucked up. Because they INCLUDE THE WEIGHT OF THE "CARRIER MEDIUM" IN THE WEIGHT OF THE SUBSTANCE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know, this is really, really fucked up. So say you have a vial of LSD, it's half filled. Well, from a federal stance, the weight of that thick glass dropper is what is going to fuck you even worse if you're caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's the math:
    <br/>
    Lets say you have 50 blotters of acid with 150ug on each blotter.
    <br/>
    You have 7.5mg of LSD. Quite a bit, but no 500mg.
    <br/>
    Now say a blotter weighs 10mg each with the dose added.
    <br/>
    50 blotters is 500mg of weight, 500mg of a Federal charge against you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's a fucked up perception. When I was in college I even caused a stink about it with my professor regarding this story he told:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There has been a publicized past conviction of someone being caught with 4g of LSD because of the blotter weighing it down. This results in a level 28 felony, I encourage you to look up what a level 28 Felony is..(hint, as of the early 2000's, a level 28 Felony was possession of an Atomic Weapon of Mass destruction without intent to use it or take the lives of anyone else. Intent to detonate the weapon ups you to a level 30-something. Don't remember the exact number.") This was the actual case my Prof mentioned that got me in a heated discussion at the time. :^P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please refer to the USSC website (ussc.gov) to research more.

    Just another story to help people realize how important it is to follow the "rules". Hopefully vendors read this and start putting more time in packaging a customers order, the buyer takes all the risk when receiving goods. TOO many times I have picked up a (friends...) order and could feel the pills or "goods" inside. Take the time to just wrap it up in a bunch of paper or something. Shit, I have heard ( not seen, :)) of people opening priority envelopes and their shit falling on the floor in a fucking ziploc baggie. Majority of the time the vendor cannot be blamed for this, but the buyer with their shitty FEEDBACK(a whole other thread should be started about recent feedback IMO). Horrible packaging should be noted in feedback as it is the MAIN reason of people getting caught. Look at the Canada drug bust thread, almost ALL of them got busted because the packaging was stupid or they were not following the "rules" people on SR are supposed to follow(ex, shitty packaging, using fake receive addresses, and not vacuum sealing k-9 detectable drugs).
    <br/>
    Either way international orders pose more risk and you should order domestic if you can, the price is worth the safety/freedom.
    <br/>
    Everyone stay safe, step your game up, and keep posting articles like this. We are a family and need to take the appropriate measure to never have this happen to one of our own.(unless he is retarded, that's what retards are for, keeping other retards(LE) busy)

    The 50 hits weighed .5 grams probably.  I'm guessing he was caught due to the fact that someone he sold to was caught by police and talked.  He probably blabbed all over that he had the best shit and had it mailed to him from Canada.  Loose lips sink ships.
