    lady at post office gave my friend a stack of fifty right off the desk in front of her but because it wasnt closed he scared to use it. hes like they probly set ppl up that way! anybody agree i wanna calm this guy down, but hes between a rock and a hard place! if he doesnt use tracking 75% of the customers will claim non-delivery even though they all got the packages. so opinion good idea, bad idea. he thinks maybe the ones on her desk are there open for that reason i believe she gave him the ones she was going to use. she said im not suppose to give these to you slid them over while po was emty and asked him to put them away asap due to her getting in trouble. they suppose to tell you call usps who in turn tells you just go to post office!
