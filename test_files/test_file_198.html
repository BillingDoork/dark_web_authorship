    hey SR
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i've had more than one item not turn up.  its been about a month since the orders. i've had previous orders arrive from similar source countries much quicker. i'm in australia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i got a postal pick up message when i wasn't expecting one, saying the article is 'sign for' but i specified to sellers that i don't want this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    worst case: it has been picked up by LE and its the old catch-em-at-the-post-office trick.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im not going to pick it up from the post office.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what i want to know is: is my address now compromised and unusable, or can i continue to order stuff? i don't order large amounts, just small every so often for personal use etc.

    There's no such thing as "the old catch em at the post office trick". The police aren't going to stake out your local post office 9-5 just so they can arrest you signing for your 1 gram order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they were going to bust you they would have done a controlled delivery and searched your house immediately after. They didn't do this, so go collect your drugs and stop being such a fucking pussy. Just because you told the vendor you don't want to sign doesn't mean they care.

    above is correct!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    they wouldnt stake it out, but they could probably just ask for video evidence of you signing for the package if they were building a case against you, which is still unlikely for your 1g order

    Luckily all of you know exactly how LEO operates and can give such definitive answers such as what they do and what they don't when dealing with imported narcotics - wonderful! When dealing with law related material and ones freedom it is important you don't give out incorrect information, simply based on 'what you think' or what your friends, sisters, brothers mother heard at the pub once.

    You only have to take a look at an Aussie domestic case, where a Tasmanian night club owner received a pink slip asking to collect his express package from the post office, when in fact it was supposed to be delivered to his door. Upon collecting his package at the post office he was soon arrested. That package could've been easily marked by police and the post office advised to call 000 when someone came to claim the package, thus the police would not need to be waiting 24/7. Yes, the owner used bank transfers etc and was a complete idiot, however what I am pointing to is the fact that the pink slip was delivered when it was not supposed to be.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would highly advise burning that address since you have had a 'few' no shows. Personally, once I have one no show to a particular address I will never use that drop again - period. Please consider whether your personal amount of substance x is worth time behind bars, and considering it was an o/s order I'm sure you will not be out of pocket a great deal. As for the idiots who posted above me, do not encourage wreckless and stupid behavior, that is the quickest way to get yourself caught.

     A FORMER Hobart nightclub owner had a cocaine package addressed to his dog and delivered to his house from Victoria, a court heard yesterday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Builder Samuel John Morse, 26, of Kingston, pleaded guilty to drug trafficking yesterday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He was nabbed in May after the Kingston Mail Centre informed police a suspicious package had arrived.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Drug squad detectives investigated and discovered an ounce 28 grams of cocaine in the Express Post package addressed to "Benji" Morse.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They replaced the drug with sugar, prosecutor Patrick Dixon told the Supreme Court in Hobart, and waited.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Postal workers tried to deliver the package to Morse's address and left a calling card when they discovered he was not home.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He picked it up the next day and opened it during the drive home.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After finding it contained sugar instead of cocaine he threw it out the window, Mr Dixon said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Drug detectives arrived at his house a short time later.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They learned Benji was Morse's dog and the package was the second such delivery he had ordered in recent weeks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The first ounce costing $7500 arrived undetected weeks earlier, Morse confessed, after he and three friends put up the money and he arranged for a Victorian-based dealer to supply the drug, which is not widely available in Tasmania.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Defence lawyer Jim Saric said because Morse was the one with the drug dealer contact, he agreed to place the order and planned to store his quarter-ounce share away for future use.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Police could not have charged him over the first ounce had it not been for his confession, the court heard.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Mr Dixon said that Morse refused to name his dealer or provide the bank details he had used to deposit the money until they told him what he was being charged with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Morse had recently sold his share in CBD nightclub Halo for $80,000, Mr Dixon said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Mr Saric told Justice David Porter that Morse was very remorseful and had undergone drug counselling during which his counsellor determined he was unlikely to take drugs again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Justice Porter was told Morse, who was ashamed of what he had done, had led an exceptionally industrious life and was in every other respect an excellent contributor to society.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The judge ordered he be assessed for a community service order suitability before bailing him to reappear for sentence next Thursday.

    Excellent point railingcapz. +1 for you. There is an ever increasing number of members here who post misinformation for others to read across a broad range of topics. Why people write posts on topics they have a limited knowledge of, is beyond me. Why would you even bother. Unless your information is correct and useful, please don't post with regards to issues such as security, shipping, etc. This only does more harm than good and could potentially cause someone to unknowingly make a life changing mistake.

    do you really think they will go to all this trouble for 1 gram? they charged him with trafficing because he had an ounce and owned up to a previous ounce, i can guarantee you they wont do this for 1 gram, the charge would be possession and for that would prob only get a warning and maybe a small fine, not worth their paperwork i think, thats just my opinion and if it was me i wouldn't worry about it but hey, thats just me(and a few other people by the sounds of it).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i wouldn't order to that address again but not for fear of arrest, i'd choose a new addy just so they pricks don't seize my next order

    The slip happened to me this year and the vendor for some stupid reason posted with sig required. I got 2 slips and after the final one i decided to go and grab it. After all there were 8 pills sitting in the post office. I went in there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No cameras, no dodgy looking guy pretending to read a zoo weekly mag no nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just suss it out and be careful. Use your instincts and dont do anything stupid. AND never use the vendor again..chances are he will send you another package with sig required.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously people be careful and smart. If you are going to order say a huge amount then be very careful as thats what the AFP are after. If you order 10 pills..make sure to spread out the order.

    That is so true! I can't believe it myself and I can't wait to leave this island of morons! I mean just have a look at the amount of threads with Australia (Shtraya) in the title. No other people on the planet take themselves as seriously than 22 million brain amputated aussie. You don't see 348278783748374837 threads about France, UK, Spain and Germany combined. So DUMB!

    I had 4 packets from India get to customs in Australia then get held. That was about a year ago. Been on the road for 6months using the same adresse with no hiccups. Had 16 orders all in gram range, 12 arrived with no particularly great stealth, i could'nt swear on a bible but my gut feeling is, selective scamming vendors are mostly to blame ( nearly all my failed deliveries were followed by dirt bag vendors leaving town and the couple that did'nt are in the process of serious ratings decline), followed by dodgy customs/postal workers.
    <br/>
    In the event genuine customs find, it must be passed on to police for any action outside of customs plant matter etc laws to act on and no matter the over blown reputation of customs, the slacker who finds it will, 1 pocket it or trash it and say job well done. These guys are just doin the 9-5 and their superiors are too busy watching they dont steal stuff or fuk up on quarintine issues that Australia is pretty strong on to catch that gram. In the event you get taken down, make sure to stick your chest out and let them know in no uncertain terms that you want a call, ring 60 min or one of the other light entertainment shows with your story and ask them to pay for your brief and perhaps a little extra for a purchase off the SR
    <br/>
    You might as well enjoy a moment in the sun, there is no way in hell that a gramish bust for anything is going to spoil your day.
    <br/>
    So get on the road and strutt your civil disobedience, dont listen to righteous fools advice.
    <br/>
    Research all vendors and watch for the tell, man its hard to know when a once good vendor is doin it again.
    <br/>
    Vendors that fuked me- MrFireUK, The Company, he the  Vendors that i used to love but- BoyMaster, CrystalWife, pretty sure on the slide and not long for the road.
    <br/>
    Stay cool and confident, you are not breaking the law.
    <br/>
    Reality will shift to support your view!

    And what makes Aussies so dumb? just because a small percentage of Bogans like to call Australia "Straya"? Thats like saying all Yanks fuck their sisters like the red neck Cletis,
    <br/>
    most of us know how laxed our drug laws are for personal use that's why we don't really care about using our own details for delivery. Admittedly some don't know the laws and want to reassure them selves by asking on the forums(isn't that what forums are for)? to say all Aussies are dumb just proves how dumb YOU are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    most people on here live in countries that are tuff on drugs and think all buyers on SR should take the same precautions as they do, for example, when one receives a card in the mail that says they have a parcel waiting for them at the Post Office, most Americans will never pick it up and loose their gram of whatever, whereas aussies are smart enough to know that a gram of whatever will not be worth AFP arresting them for and will go to the PO to pick up their good weekend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    when you think about it, if you get a card to pick up a parcel from the PO and never go to get it, i think that would be more suss and out of human nature, the first thing anyone does when they get a card saying there is something for them at the post office is to wonder what it is then run straight there to find out, they wouldn't just leave it there unless they have something to hide or worry about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'm sick of people calling Aussies dumb just because they ask questions

    On behalf of my fellow Aussie's, in particular NotMe123, I would like to say a big G'DAY to the two tossers, bippo and redbaron, who despite being devoid of a single brain cell between them, have managed to give new meaning to the word DUMB!! These two brain surgeons are a contributing factor in the recent demise of this once great place and why the Forum is no longer the site it once was. Now let's address some of bippo's comments who clearly requires some help.

    The BUYER chooses the shipping method they desire when placing an order. Your the stupid reason a signature was required scoop!! Vendors aren't going to spend more of their own money on Tracked Shipping if the buyer hasn't selected and paid for it during checkout. That's just common sense for fucks sake.

       Yes bad advice to go and jjts pick up your goods but at the same time the AFP is not going to set up at a high cost a sting just to nab you and your 1 gram or couple of pills.

       The slip happened to me this year and the vendor for some stupid reason posted with sig required. I got 2 slips and after the final one i decided to go and grab it. After all there were 8 pills sitting in the post office. I went in there.

       Just suss it out and be careful. Use your instincts and dont do anything stupid. AND never use the vendor again..chances are he will send you another package with sig required.

       <br/>
       Seriously people be careful and smart. If you are going to order say a huge amount then be very careful as thats what the AFP are after. If you order 10 pills..make sure to spread out the order.

     I just don't want to go through what i did at the start of the year. I used a fake name and the seller sent it and then i got one of those cards in the mailbox telling me i need to show ID etc. Anyway i scammed the PO and got it delivered without a sig required..in most of my orders i use a fake name and i have also discovered that here at my qork the office next door has been vacant for 1 year now and doesn't look like being used at all..i checked the mailbox and its open and ready for deliveries!

    Bippo posted that in the main thread. So let me get this straight, he has no idea if you have to sign for a tracked overseas package but he's giving out advice about collecting narcotics from a post office, and whether the AFP will arrest you or not. I literally cannot fathom how stupid this idiot is.

    Sad to read that the original question degenerated into something else. I will try to answer your questions, as I found myself in the exact same situation, but in another part of the world!
    <br/>
    Do not pick it up, cut your losses and move on! Try not to use that same vendor again if possible. Whether the address has been compromised or not, I would suggest testing it with small legit stuff from the clearweb!

    You are actually so dumb, and are missing the point entirely. Your forum account is less than a month old (now non-existent), you've made a few small orders and your giving incorrect advice which could effect someone's freedom. I don't think you understand the seriousness of the situation. The fact that you think 10 pills is a large order and believe that they should be 'spread out' over multiple packages just proves you know nothing of whats going on here. The point I am trying to get across, is don't spread misinformation. If every dick and his dog comes along here and types out what they think they know based on nothing but 2 or 3 transactions, then this forum will turn to the shit. Understand your place, don't think you know it all because you've had some success, it is not the same for everyone. Don't even post as a guest, I suggest making a new forum account, because your ignorance on this account is way to high at the moment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S You cannot troll for shit, if you hate Australia so much then move elsewhere. Oh and for your 'bogan' claim, you seem to be far more illiterate than those that have posted before you, so keep trolling yourself. Literally talking to a brick wall.
