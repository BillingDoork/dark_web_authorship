    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just to clarify this question, is there any sort of recording system for international mail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm inclined to think there isn't due to the massive amount of mail coming into the country. But is there any sort of scanning or recording? Say i ordered something that was split up into multiple shipments, even if they were really inconspicuous could they be scrutinized more because there are several parcels going to the same address, even if there were different names on each?

    Anything with a customs form - YES, definitely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The border agencies are allowed to do whatever they wish, there is a chance they take pictures or scans of envelope covers too.

    Yes there is a chance that customs will take digital scans of your parcels.  That chance is approximately 1 in 370 milllion.  LOL.  Everyone who works with international mail is required to have a genius level IQ, be a marathon runner or triathlete, operate at 100% efficiency throughout every minute of every shift that they work, and read 100 volumes of self-help literature every year.  They are the modern equivalent of the superheroes of the past, but obviously they are also genetically engineered for physical and mental superiority.

    Never try to order from Silk Road because their x-ray vision is impossible to defeat.  Furthermore scientists are secretly altering DNA to form ultrasound sensors in their fingertips to provide for an even higher level of contraband confiscation.  I think if you google "tongue camera" you will get an idea of how this is possible.
