    It's quite obvious it's a scam. Anyone who actually tried to use it is a dumb ass in my eyes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They are spamming on forums, the prices are ridiculously cheap, they accept nearly all payment methods, and one Google search will come up with heaps of pages saying it's a scam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know how much more obvious it needs to be.

    Contact PayPal? Tell them you have got scammed. They will probably charge back the transaction.

    And the scammer is an idiot - at first I thought it was Mt Gox misspelled, but when I checked his URL, it turned out that the spelling error was intentional. We all know who uses slightly misspelled popular site names, don't we.
