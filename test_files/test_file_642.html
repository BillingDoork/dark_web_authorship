    Hello everyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I see from the Royal Mail update pages that postal services have been affected by bad weather. This seems to have affected deliveries from last Friday onwards. The problem is ongoing and they say they are working to clear the backlog.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other users noticed a delay in UK postage times? I certainly have. Mr. Jones is likely to be visiting if the postman is not.
    <br/>

    Yes. Someone on here sent me something last thursday by first class post and it still hasn't arrived! No idea if it will actually turn up now but I received an international order before it which is weird.

    I already had 2 nights of bad sleep because of unusual delays from UK to EU, waiting on 3 orders.
    <br/>
    RM says on its website that post was not handled for some countries for up to 5 days due to bad weather and closed airports.
    <br/>
    So light up and lean back. Your mailman is just stuck in the snow:-D

    Waiting on two coming in. EU to UK
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Funny thing is that I received domestic mail in good time, around the time it was expected, so what kind of delays are theyexperiencing? Is it only international orders that have been delayed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bit anxious here now as I sit twiddling my thumbs.
