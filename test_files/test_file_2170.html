    I ordered phentermine here...the seller said it shipping within five days...on 23rd but since then it has been stuck with the customs.
    <br/>
    Is it normal for them to hold customs for this long ?
    <br/>
    Do i have to worry about anything?
    <br/>
    Are they going to open the package ?
    <br/>
    How long will it take for them to clear ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    regards,

    My man, there is no answer to any of your questions. Most likely if it is held at customs for more than a couple days than they have already opened it..... You do not have anything to worry about as they do not have any proof that YOU actually ordered those drugs to your house. Think about it, if someone hated me they could just mail a large quantity of drugs to my house and leave an anonymous tip so they check my mail and try and get me arrested. But this of course wouldn't work unless they could actually prove I myself ordered those drugs, which is really impossible to prove if you ordered them from here..... But is it pointless to ask questions about how long they normally hold packages for, etc. Because how do you think anyone could accurately answer these questions? Every mail sorting station is different my man......your order could be fine and has simply not arrived yet......
