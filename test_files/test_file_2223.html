    Hey
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had 2 packages in transit first one was under &lt;10g (that didnt show up after 30+ days from a trusted vendor) and this one which is due is also &lt;10g.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today I sort of got a slip in the mail to go pick up something from the post office. The thing is the slip is in the householders name and not mine which was being used..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do you think they would attempt a delivery on a householders name? I need to check with the householder to see if they are waiting on something .. otherwise.. I don't know if I should give the slip the postmen left behind to go get them to pick up whatever it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's just real odd that today I am expecting this order.. and this comes through. Last time I used this vendor I did not have to sign for anything. They left it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a feeling they may be after me by getting to the householder to talk and this would be their way in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice appreciated thanks .
    <br/>

    LOL I have a sneaking suspicion that smoking crack may ramp up the paranoia a notch, not take it down.

    Good luck with it all OP, I am sure it will be ok. Just keep it together when you go and get it and if you have bad vibes par it off.
