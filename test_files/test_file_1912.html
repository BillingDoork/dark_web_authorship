    Hey so not sure if this is a stupid question or not but just figured I would ask anyway. So I'm ordering a couple of fake licenses from a vendor on SR. I've been looking online for busts and have seen that a lot of people have been getting busted for receiving ids from IDchief, which has made me a bit paranoid. None of the fake ids have any of our real information. What is the probability of a package with fake ids being seized? And if the package was to be seized how screwed would I be?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance to anyone that responds to this.

    I'm a vendor of fake IDs and I can give you a bit of advice on this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I sell the cheap Florida ones and I ship them stealthily and constantly change the return addresses to different addresses/businesses names. This is to generally avoid my packages becoming the "norm" or to have them be noticed. I also stick the ID(s) behind a giftcard (not activated obviously) and stick it in a thankyou card. That being said I also ship USPS - I've read official USPS documentation that states under which circumstances packages can be opened and my packages aren't anywhere close to that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Long story short, fake IDs are never gonna be stopped in shipping. People order meth/cocaine everyday here and they never get caught up - theirs no drug sniffing dogs for IDs ;) but I don't know about popular sellers like IDchief as the US might have a whole section just for catching his customers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, hope that helps!
