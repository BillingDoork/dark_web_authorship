    I am just trying to get some straight answers on tracking a package from Canada to the U.S. . I have googled it every way I know how and all the answers I get contradict each other. Ok, I placed an order with a very well known vendor, and it shipped Friday, before noon from Canada. I recieved the tracking number immediatly. I know that it can take up to 24 hours for it to show in the system, but as of right now, it is still not in the system I have tracked on Canada post website, as well as the usps site. Both say that "this number is not in our system." .  I have had some people say that it will not show until it clears customs, others say it will not show until it hits customs, and still others say it will show before that. I have heard also, that because of saturday mail in Canada( I guess it doesn't run?) and the holiday on Monday, that my package will just sit at the canadian post office until tuesday. Others have said it will move, but tracking will not show in the system until tues. or wednesday because of the weekend and holiday. and finally, one person said..."tracking an express post from Canada? ROFLMFAO! you will notice activity when you track about 2 weeks AFTER you get your package"...seriously, can I get some straight answers? This is ridiculous... xoxo sickgirl

    I can give you the realness lol  ....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if it is XpressPost USA then tracking will show up as soon as it is dropped off at a postal location.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if it is sent using ship in a click with a prepaid cc, tracking shows up as soon as the label is made with the "electronic info submitted" scan
    <br/>
    <br/>
    however if it is in a prepaid XpressPost USA envelope that they can drop in boxes, then its possible it may not show up for quite some time, true. maybe not til it hits customs.

    Thank you. I am pretty much certain that it is probably a prepaid express post usa envelope, as it contains narcotics...lol. So, I guess I would have to wait for it to hit customs then. Thank you very much :) xoxo sickgirl

    Yeah, your pack may not leave til Monday night.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They say before noon and your mail leaves same day from the boxes ... but if its a big city, thats not always true.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They start picking up at 10-11 and dont give a fuck lol. They simply dont have the time to hit every box after 12 and still get shit out same day.

    Have you tried packagetrackr.com?

    I have noticed that sometimes the tracking info there is slightly more updated...which I always found to be slightly odd (You would think the carrier site would offer more detail)?

    If it was dropped in a mailbox Friday and wasnt picked up from the mailbox, it would still have been there this morning and not move til today. They dont pick up on Saturdays and Monday was a holiday.

    Might be a day or so still. Shitty, but thats the way it is with CP.

    Yeah, logically I know this. I guess posting was a way of relieving my frustration. I am not only addcited to opiates (though not nearly as bad as I used to be), but I am severely addicted to methamphetamine, and I have gave that up completely, as of 3(?) weeks ago. Done with the crystal for good. Considering that the only opiates (and any drugs for that matter) that I have to get me through are some percs and some codeine, I think I am doing fairly well. Just sucks knowing I have this crazy quality gear arriving, and not knowing anything...top that off with the fact it has to go through customs, and well, lol, I am pacing and bouncing.

    I ordered something Xpress post from Canada and it didn't show up in tracking until 3 whole days later and the next day it was at my door.  Seems the package moves much faster than the tracking.

    I will never forget the day my bro turned me on to that book.....many INVOLVED discussions took place (after consuming a substantial amount of psychadelics of course) regarding sethspeaks and another book called "The Dancing Wu Li Masters".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has there been any update on your package yet?
    <br/>
    I had a similar situation as Followicculus one time - Tracking showed minimal updates for the duration - then out of nowhere on day 3 I found that I had an express package waiting.

    lol.. canada post online tracking sucks!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been tracking a package for 6 days.. its headed to the states from canada.. it says left canada 6 days ago.. but no other info has been added and that info was put up 4 days ago..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    then.. today i get a msg from the person waiting for his product asking me if he has to sign for it because he had a letter on his door to go pick it up at the post office...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    until he gets it will never know if its even my package ( he thinks so ) but it just goes to show you how fucked up CP is... and now reading that you got your stuff and it still says its in transit makes me feel more like it is my package that arrived to him... safe and sound!!!
