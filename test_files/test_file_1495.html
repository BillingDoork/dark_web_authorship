    I use USPS Priority, which comes w/tracking. Tracking on website says "Out for Delivery" days ago, but cstmr has not received; or at least has not finalized or admitted receipt, nor does USPS tracking says it was delivered. Just "Out for Delivery" but nothing more. No delivery.
    <br/>

    This is where its been for days now. Theres nothing smellable, and pkge is double stealthed; that is, holds a sealed and addressed container inside the Priority Mail envelope, so a tear-open will not neceessarily derail the pkge arriving.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone experience anything similar? And what about SR arbitration in the matter?

    Possibly lost in transit. I would think SR would go 50/50 refund unless you want to offer more to him.

    Could it be that the guy either didn't sign for it, or scheduled another delivery?Â  If they're still planning on delivering it, but hadn't for one of those reasons, the customer could be trying to scam you... just sayin.
