    I have no experience but probably not. However since we are dealing with illegal drugs and substances I wouldn't take the risk and either use a postbox registered under a different, fake name or even better a friend that you can trust.

    Always remember that safety should come first and consider the worst case scenario.

    I never got why people always had such deep compulsions to take drugs when on probation. Is it really that bad to wait until you're off the hook and don't have to take any tests or show up for anything?

    Its just a drop that has a criminal record.  Believe it or not it is often easier to convince criminals to do criminal things, like import drugs.

    Ah, I see...  8)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it's pretty unlikely that a normal shipment to someone with a criminal record would be noticed (criminals receive mail just as much as everyone else, and a TON of people have criminal records).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But if the shipment is subject for increased scrutiny for some reason - God forbid you should end up with a love letter or a CD - having a record would probably be a deciding factor in that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once they've already become the squeaky wheel, you dig?

    There must be literally millions of people in the United States with criminal records and/or currently on probation and parole, and millions, or many thousands, more on one or another government watch list who don't actually have a record. It seems doubtful that all these people's mail could raise any kind of a flag that could realistically be acted upon.

    Also, for what it's worth, Amazon and eBay sellers regularly ship orders to people currently incarcerated in jails and prisons with no problem.

    If he is on probation it is a very bad idea. When you're on probation, your PO can show up at any time to search your place/give a piss test or to check curfew. He will also probably be on the police radar, so if there is any suspicion with the package, he will go down.If he has a suspended sentence he is going to jail 100%. Be careful, it doesn't take too much for people to flip, especially importing illegal substances.If the shipment is domestic and it's a legit vendor you should be OK.Just keep tabs on the person and learn how to search court records.Prison fucking sucks, no one wants to be there....

    Be careful. Someone with a record is likely to flip your name because I assume they would have more to lose if caught.

    The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world . That means millions have gone thru the system, and millions more will go thru it  . It would be a huge waste of resources to monitor that amount of mail .  If its domestic , i say send away unless they are being investigated for something .

    Not only do they run every name, check for criminal history, warrants, blood type, porn fetish type but they send scuba-divers out to collect stool samples!!!

    Ok all jokes aside as long as the address is not red flagged ship away! Just realize that those who have most to lose will snitch the most

    I've noticed anecdotal that people on probation/parole have a higher chance of having a controlled delivery.  I don't think they are flagged but if the package does get caught it seems they are going to get a controlled delivery instead of a letter.

    I would have thought that the only problem, domestically and internationally, would be to someone already under investigation, rather than gnarled old lags  ;). As far as customs goes, think how much mail goes through daily. There's no way you could check it all against a list of hundreds of thousands of people with criminal records. It's more the suspicious nature of a package which will get it checked out.
