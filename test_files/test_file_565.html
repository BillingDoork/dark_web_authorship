    I am just wondering, I've seen some people talking about getting half p or LB to there house weekly or every other week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Doesn't this raise any red flags for the mailman? Constantly dropping off boxes from cali weekly or every other week?

    Yes, if that's the only thing you're having sent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No, if you mix in packages from legit businesses

    I had over 100 packages from ebay delivered before i hit the Road.
    <br/>
    Everyone at my post office knows me, they see me and instantly grab my packages and stuff, so that helps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But with all the people receiving mail everywhere, i dont think it looks suss to the postman, their just doing a job.
    <br/>
    If its delivered to a business name at home or to a PO then i dont see any problem at all.
