    Hey everybody, Gonna be starting my vendor account up in the next month or so just waiting on our medical marijuana crop to be down and up since it will be the back bone of our menu. Last thing I need to iron out is a question related to shipping. So this is all for you SR veterans out there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I used to vend from the early 2000's until about 2007 then when people where hard pressed for cash business just basically stopped so I stopped too. Well back in my day we always did Xpress post within Canada since it did not cross any boarders we figured if it did, With tracking it would be more subject to search then a regular stealth snail mail envelope.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So within Canada was Xpress post &amp; every ware else was always snail mail to avoid customs inspections. This worked with weed, Everything we used to offer as long as it was vacuum sealed. I am curious if this is still the best method or where we wrong &amp; will any package slip through just as easily be it trackable or not as long as its stealth ? was our theory of the package having a tracking # making it more susceptible to search wrong ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance for answering this guys &amp; cant wait to see you all on the road.

    Express tracked mail from Canada to AU definitely gets seized a lot more than regular mail, can't comment on other countries.
