    Ordered some weed that was marked delivered last Wednesday. No sign of it at all. I've been holding out hope that it would just show up but now I'm ready to cut my losses. Is it safe to order again? Anyone had an experience like this? I have no intention of calling the PO.

    Do not call the PO, why would that even be an option? Have you contacted the vendor? Why would it not be safe to order? If you suspect the vendor of scamming you, I would not recommend buying from the same vendor again, but another respected vendor should be safe.

    Thanks for the response. I trust the vendor, big name on here. He shared tracking with me. Just a little paranoid about having a package full of drugs with my name on it floating around somewhere. Suppose you're right tho I'll probably wait another week before ordering just to be safe.

    i'm in same situation with different substance. I'm more interested in whether seizing the package (in this case quite small) would put my name on a watchlist. i know it depends on the country, but then if another package gets seized then that's closing in towards evidence right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    would it be more appropriate to change address?

    Again, no need to fret. Most likely scenario, your package was lost in transit, you mistakenly wrote your address wrong, or it was never sent. You are likely NOT on any watch list. I always advise you should take any and all precautions you feel are necessary and this forum has some great resources for methods and guidelines you should follow to protect yourself and others in our community. I also tend to feel that some people take their fears overboard and thinking you are on a watch list of a small amount of substance is a bit of a stretch.

    I had a medium sized intl pack go missing.  I stopped ordering for a couple of months to let things clear to that address/name at least.  Pack was from a big name vendor and I am pretty sure it was shipped.  After the waiting dry out period I began placing small orders both domestic and intl.  They have all come through since.

    Only you can decide if it is safe but this has been my experience.  Sometimes these things get lost I guess or get snatched in some way that won't land you on any list.  Who knows really.

    appreciate the feedback. i'm about to ramp up my security anyway so whatever about this package, my anxiety is a warning that i need to take things a bit more seriously.

    Thanks
