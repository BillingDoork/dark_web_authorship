    I want to preface this post by saying a few things: Anyone that has seen some of my posts (I've recently deleted some within the last two weeks because I felt I was giving away too much info about myself) hopefully understands I'm not one of these "Ask the same question repeatedly" types that never does any research. In fact I love research. Its my life and believe me, I've researched the hell out of the following scenario but haven't come up with much useful info.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had a shipping error, I am the receiver of the package, and the package was intended for a PO box. As of right now, as far as the DCN the seller provided has revealed, the package is in the 4th level of postal loop hell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have not attempted to contact USPS about the package, nor has the seller as I currently feel this would be unwise given the amount of time this package has spent in the hands of the postal system so far.Â  I do not know who has seen it or if anyone has suspected anything about it. There's been quite a decent amount of time between the date it was shipped and my posing this question. I don't want to give out exact dates in this forum for certain reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything I have read about people that have "undeliverable as addressed" packages, whether they be for illicit items or legitimate goods all seem to say the same thing. Trying to contact anyone at USPS about a lost package is about as fruitful a venture as trying to understand the film Mulholland Drive. All kinds of forums are ripe with stories about lost goods in the mail, postal loops, dead-end customer service, unhelpful USPS employees, conversations with Post-Masters telling callers to "give it five more days", bizarre cowboy assassins, blue creatures hiding behind diners in LA.....you get the idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So far, as much as I can tell, this package has not been sent to the dead mail recovery center in Atlanta. The product was packaged in such a way that it is not readily obvious that it contains anything if the package were to be opened but I know this is no guarantee of anything. What I don't know is if the package has been x-rayed at any point in transit thus far, especially since it has been in transit for so long now. Honestly anyone could have discovered its contents as far as I'm concerned and I'm playing it this way. The one hopeful thing I have in my favor is that it seems as though, even if one is able to describe the package and all that jazz to the mail recovery center, supply pictures and whatnot (in the case of legitimate packages) that the mail recovery center has a pretty low record and either ends up destroying the contents of the mail or selling it in bulk at scheduled auctions. Information was truly scant and repetitive and not of much help in the case of illicit drugs found. Most articles, if they bothered to mention it, simply stated "Illegal drugs are immediately reported to Postal Inspectors". Well, yeah.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I have certain needs. Needs that Silk Road can help me with but I am unsure of whether it would be wise to use my current PO box or if I should abandon that particular address for anymore illicit transactions. I ceased using it for illegal stuff the moment I found out my package was misaddressed. I'm an end user, not a vendor, but I know that doesn't matter if the right (or wrong as it were) set of circumstances were to come into play.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From the few posters that have talked about lost packages they were able to track, it seems that almost all of them were continuing to log in and post well over a year after the initial loss of the package, so that makes me hopeful that none of these people were considered to be of enough interest to either postal inspectors or their local law enforcement to be pursued. In most cases they were dealing with substances of a more severe scheduling than mine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To you veterans out there, what would you do? I want some honest opinions. Should I continue to treat this as a burned address? Should I balls up and try to get that package on its correct course or just let it go? Should I be looking for a new address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should I stop asking questions and drop off the Road altogether?

    you used a return addy linked to you? And you're asking us if you should try to retrieve your drugs from the government?

    also those undeliverable addys happen all the time, if you dont recall this is a drug community and druggies are probably one of the dumbest fucking groups on earth, most of them have a hard time spelling their name much less giving a real working address. I'd say 10% of my sales have bad addresses and i copy/paste all my shit like most vendors do so it aint me.

    No, no. I was the buyer and the vendor sent the package to the wrong address. I didn't want to get into it with him about it and just decided to let it go. The return address was unfortunately a non-functioning facility so there's no telling what happened when they see that the address is undeliverable and the return address is worthless. You make a good point though about the intelligence levels of some of the people here but I am seeking advice from people that have a little bit more about them than being smack dab in the middle of the bell curve. I'm just looking for counsel amongst a number of advisers.

    Was the PO box in your name? If not, then just go rent another box for the time being or use your home address. See if the original package ever shows up and then if it doesn't never go back to your original PO. Good luck
