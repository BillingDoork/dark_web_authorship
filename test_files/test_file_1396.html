    So my friend who also orders from the SR has not received the last 3 orders he has placed. One of them was from a vendor that I have used plenty of times and is someone I know would not scam.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The other two are top notch vendors with great stats.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first 2 orders are from EU to the USA, he has made over 30 orders and everyone of them has gotten there before Auto Finalize was even an option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It has been close 3 weeks since the orders were placed and nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this a weird coincidence or is he flagged? What do you all think?

    Clean the address...tend your house. Then worry. It does make it seem more like it's flagged because 3 are caught. Make sure your friend knows the postal worker or just doesn't answer the door if they ever show up. Let them leave it or a slip.

    Where in EU? When I've ordered UK-&gt;US before, packages can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 2-3 MONTHS. It can suck, and because of the wait, I don't even bother because it's waaay to long to wait.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You really haven't given enough information to give solid advice on the matter. What did you order? Who were the vendors? What country was the package coming from?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's likely nothing to worry about, but it really depends on the vendors stealth. If you are really paranoid, clean house, and don't answer the door. Most mail men won't stand around ringing your door for minutes... LE would. LE also would not leave slips during a CD and let you pick it up at the PO.. at least not that I am aware of.

    One order was 5g of mdma from a vendor in Germany (not giving mames out). 2nd was a small LSD order from Poland, and last was a domestic small LSD order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's just very odd because I have ordered from the LSD poland vendor and always received my package in under a week. We also live in the same city.

    Hiya,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I almost feel like LE have some way of recognizing MBBs.......majorly paranoid I know!, but seems to have been a lack of success lately, and the push for all vendors to use MBBs may not have been the best idea.....perhaps we need greater variety?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hmmm, i don't know. Hope you packages turn up mate!

    How are they seeing the MBB tho? I've read they show up just like a plastic bag on xrays...so if they are opening the package they are just seeing a MBB. I don't think that is suspicious in itself...domestic orders especially. They generally have to be pretty bad stealth to draw any extra attention. Those MBBs don't exist because of SilkRoad, so they are obviously supporting a legal industry...
