    and nothing happened. It was a legit purchase, but it came in a regular brown box with a handwritten label, definitely the sort of thing people on the road would get pissed at. I think people here are overestimating the governments competence.

    Tracking via usps.com thru TOR is something one should try to avoid as it can possibly send up red flags should inspectors be looking at logs of the website's visitors.  It's not that they WILL go after and investigate Tor users checking tracking but rather they CAN and COULD if they wanted to.  It's an necessary risk in a game that's mined end to end with potential risks.  I'll try to find a piece that dates back several years documenting a similar scenario.  Someone who was rather well known in the MOM scene was busted after Postal Inspectors recorded his IP address after having seized a pkg.  The cross referenced tracking inquiries of that particular tracking number and identified his true IP address. From there all it takes is a request from LE to the ISP to hand over account info associated with that IP address.

    Surely it doesn't take that much creativity to find another computer to do this on?

    Actually, if you have a burner no need for an Internet connection.  Just dial 1-800-ask-usps to check tracking.
