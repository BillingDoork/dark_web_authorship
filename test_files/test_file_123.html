    Hello to all my Israeli drug enthusiasts friends!  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This thread is for sharing useful information about the shipping to our little country.
    <br/>
    As you probably know, the only disadvantage in the SR community is the shipping. Until someone will start a worldwide stealthy delivery service (U.S.P.S. - United Stealthy Parcel Services??), we all must deal with the normal worldwide delivery services and our local post offices...  : :(
    <br/>
    If you have ordered anything from Silk Road, please, share with us your information - What did you order? Where the order was sent from? How long did it take to arrive? Was the shipment successful? Did you get any trouble with our customs ? ect. ect. ect...
    <br/>
    If we all work together, we can more or less, know our customs better and prevent other innocent Israeli guys from getting busted  :'(, as well as know what drugs are the most safe to order, which vendors send the most safely to Israel and how much is too much...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, I'll be the first : The only drug I've ordered from Silk Road is LSD and only LSD blotters. Currently, 6 out of 7 orders arrived safely and stealthy in regular envelopes and I hope the rest will arrive successfully be'ezrat Hashem  ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To each sahbak out there - Please, spread the thread!  ;)
    <br/>
    Together we will win the Anti-Anti-Drug war!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay peaceful and safe,
    <br/>

    OK, let's say that there are LE watching the community. What can they possibly do? After all, every user is anonymous, every shipment is stealthy and every address is encrypted. So how can they track after someone?? There are millions of packages and envelopes being sent across the world every day, so unless someone is gonna inform that he's gonna order 10kg cocaine to the US or something like that, it's a never ending war...

    They are sending our cities 12'000 rockets every years for the last 12 years, i would assume white phosphorus is a decent answer
    <br/>
    considering the face that any other country in the world would NUKE their assess for much less :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW some nice post for all the we get our knowlege about the middle east from the media that are out there:
    <br/>
    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=78100.msg616372#msg616372
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i cant reason still how stupid are people out there
    <br/>
    comparing people that in 9/11 sent all they have to help people in NY to other people who danced on the roofs of gaza
    <br/>
    <br/>
    comparing country that for every child that gets killed in gaza - the media is going wild to a media that when jewish kids die in suicide bomimb they are celebrating on the streets of gaza
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just imaging what would happen if Austin Texas would start firing 1000's of rockets at San Antionio citizens  for no reason (cause they are not related - same as Israel is NOT related to gaza - left at 2005) hhhmmmm...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the only thing makes me happy reading your middle east ignorant posts is the fact that in 10 years most EU countries and some USA will go trough the same shit as we have here  -  ask France,Belgium,London,Swiss and others...

    I'd love to know the inside story on how things work especially in the postal system
    <br/>
    <br/>
    security is a pain in the ass down here. but, that being said, I have received non-illicit packages in the past (through Do'ar) and they weren't opened. but then again, seeing the equipment they have at the airport they probably don't even need to open the package to know exactly what's inside!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for however said guns... actually even though a sizable number of the population is licensed to carry a gun (for various reasons) buying a weapon is very hard and every person needs to go through background checks and security approvals, and only if he falls under the acceptable categories to carry or own
    <br/>
    buying guns off the street isn't any easier

    all good experiences for me so far, but sample size is limited. one shipment from lucydrop, one from a friend, both lsd from the great white north. i wouldn't be too concerned about shipping personal use amounts of lsd, but anything that might be observed by spectromatry (sp?) is off limits for me.
    <br/>

    essentially, if you don't sign for it, you can't get fucked. if anyone asks you to sign for it, consider it a loss, claim you never ordered anything and go on with your life.

    I actually, went to the post office, last week, and signed for an order of 2 tabs...  It wasn't smart move, however, I had a feeling that it is fine, and it was...

    If a vendor ships thru registered mail, tell him that in your area you must sign for it...

    Regarding other stuff - everything i ordered cam in with no problem.
    <br/>
    if it get caught - i guess you will have a visit from the cops (i know people had visits for small stuff as 1 cannabis seed caught in the mail)

    theoretically, you can't be held responsible for anything that comes in through the mail - UNLESS you sign for it, or if it's in your house. which means you should always use a drop point and immediately remove it from there as soon as you get it, and to be on the safe side, never sign for anything from sr. you should be safe that way, but you may still get hassled. if you want to be completely safe, don't use drugs.

    I'm curious if anybody actually once had a shipment intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's small quantities, do they just send a love letter like in the US, or do they come for a visit? Do they get a warrant to search your house or do they just question you?

    I'm from Israel and i have made 4 purchases from SR.
    <br/>
    My own personal rules are these:
    <br/>
    1. Never buy anything that doesn't fit a small letter or parcel so i never have to worry about giving signatures to anybody. The Israeli post is requiring signatures for most parcels that come domestically or internationally. In Tel Aviv at least...
    <br/>
    2. When i expect a letter, i take all the drugs out of my home and hide them somewhere. I clean everything that might be indicating that i'm a drug user so EVEN IF police decided to make a little search in my home they wouldn't think i have any connection to any letter with drugs inside.
    <br/>
    3. Don't order anything from flagged countries like NL, India and China.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Besides,
    <br/>
    some people think that customs here are super though and x-rays and dogs everywhere and bla bla bla... It's bullshit...
    <br/>
    Customs here are the same like anywhere else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I never had any problem with police/customs and i never knew personally someone who got arrested SR related, but from the bits and pieces that i collected it seems that for small amounts of drugs in the mail they might try to give you a phone call and ask you if you were expecting any mail, or send you a "love letter", or ask you to come to their office to take your mail, and then bust you.
    <br/>
    I think that in some cases they might send 2 cops to your house for a check but i really don't believe they do this every time they catch something.
    <br/>
    This is true only for small personal amounts. For bigger amounts idk how far they might go to catch you but i'm pretty sure that first they'll put you in custody, take every phone, computer or cash from you, and only then ask you the questions. By then you probably better be with a lawyer.
    <br/>
    If cops ever come to you, you should pretend to be complete innocent, and don't give any information that might be indicating that you were waiting for the package. There's a good chance that if your house looks clean and you play your role fine they won't even go inside and just leave and forget about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck and stay safe!!
