    I had a package that was scheduled for delivery via USPS First Class mail with delivery confirmation.  I used a name at the house of a prior tenant.  Tracking says that "Undeliverable as Addressed" on July 26th (Weds).  Just found out today (Sat).  The name on the package doesn't match anyone who currently lives at the address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what should I do!?  I don't even know if the package was returned to the sender yet.  The soonest I could go to the post office and attempt a pick up is Monday morning.  Will they ask for my ID?  They didn't even leave a "sorry we missed you" note.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is this package too risky to pick up now?  I've searched as see that a potential is that it will go eventually to the Mail Recovery Center and when opened, an investigation might occur.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DAMN IT!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please advise.

    Wonderful.   :o  I appreciate the YouTube video.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But seriously, what are my options?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there any chance that the USPS has already opened the package?  And, is it likely still at my local post office, or in the return mail now?

    So if initial delivery was attempted on Thursday, do you think it will still be at my local post office on Monday morning?  I could try to pick it up before it's sent to the Mail Recovery Center.

    Um, yeah, let it go, not worth the nightmare. Next time use your real name and not someone who already gets their mail forwarded to their new address, duh.

    Hoping that the package is just sitting in a box at my local PO getting ready to be returned, I'll attempt to pick it up on Monday morning.  I'll say something like "I think a letter was attempted to be delivered to address xxxx, but there was a problem with how it was addressed or something.  Could I pick it up now?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I can get it from them, that's awesome.  If it's gone, then I won't have shown any ID and that'll be that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stupid idea?

    VERY stupid. At a bare minimum, they WILL pass your package to a drug-sniffer if you attempt this. And, since drug-dogs really just alert on anything their handler thinks is suspicious, that drug dog will growl and then they'll get a warrant and open your shit up. Then you're fucked.

    Ok.  Thanks for the advice.  It's a handful (5-6) pills though.  Still too risky?

    Dude. For the third time in this thread. JUST LET IT GO. It is not worth the risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was addressed to you that would be a different story, but you can't even provide an ID for it. Just chalk it up as a loss, learn to do shipments correctly with your real name, and move on.

    I would also recommend that you give your vendor 5/5 for this particular transaction and not penalise them for your own error. Even though you have no idea if the product was as advertised, the vendor shouldn't suffer for this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, anything less than 5/5 is actually negative feedback, as it negatively impacts your vendor's stats.

    Understood.  I'll let this one go.  Won't attempt any redelivery request or pick up.  Too risky, I agree.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I only wanted to attempt to take possession so that I could fend off the Mail Resource Center from looking into it.  When I searched on the board here, I saw that some vendors in the past were affected by this process and had to change the return addresses.  I know this was my mistake; I'll give the vendor 5/5 ratings for sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh well.
