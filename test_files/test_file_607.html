    OK sometimes I get shit sent from let's say N. America not Mexico. For over half a year there has never been any problems. Now I think 2 packages have been seized. I read that there is more funding now for Arlanda airport customs. Sweden seems to step up there game. Seizing up to 10 packages a day. But they get 250,00 a day at the airport. I feel very that the packages are very good with up to 5 vac. seals done with gloves and kept very careful to not contaminate the envelope with any weed at all. So pretty sure it is not the dogs but the xray.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If so what can i write on the customs forms that looks like weed in a xray? Can I shield them at all? Sometimes I put them in a xmas tin that holds cookies. any ideas would be great.

    They will PM you if they will help you.

    Personally i'd grow my own, only the best strains, and your only sending it off, not waiting on supply.

    Get a perpetual harvest going and take advantage of the outdoor season. ;)
