    Looks like at least 1 other person has.... Keep the faith man, he's got a 100% feedback rating, even if shit got fucked up, I'm sure he'll make it right. Seems like a reputable vendor....

    I've never ordered from that vendor before but I placed an order and it shipped out Tuesday via Priority mail and I've still yet to receive it. I'm not really worried because I only go through trusted vendors, but I am curious as to why USPS seems to be backed up. ???

    i have my nerves wracked up myself.. it's been 8 days and i still haven't received anything yet (domestic). for what it's worth, the vendor i bought from is a top 15% seller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what's got me out of sorts is that yesterday i received a package from across the country, and it only took 3 days to arrive.. from USPS.

    No need to worry about WHO you ordered from . . .  USPS has not been totally consistent starting the beginning of this month.  Some items actually seem to get delivered a little quicker, while most have been on the slow side of average, but some have been flat out slow!
