    Ok so I wake up this morning and I'm going about my normal routine when the mailman knocks on the door. The first thing I notice is it's not my normal mailman. He is holding a package and asks me to sign for it. The package is from Israel. At this point I don't know what to think. I'm not expecting any packages from Israel. I go ahead and sign for it. Upon further inspection of the package it looks very sloppy, with stamps all over it in odd places. I begin getting paranoid thinking that my address was compromised somehow and this is a controlled delivery of some sort. Anyway, my curiosity got the best of me and I opened it. Turns out it was something I ordered from amazon over a month ago that I had completely forgotten about. WHEW!

    I just recently got a new postman, haven't had any issues yet.  My last one would always leave packages that required signature without thinking twice.  The new one I have had to go to the post office to start signing for all the packages that require signature unfortunately :/
