    I have been using the Gonzo Bag available at www.gonzobags.com They come in 3 different sizes and they contain activated charcoal on both sides.  It has been my experience that these work WAY better than any type of vacuum sealing simply because the dogs are unable to smell anything.  I tested this theory out myself before putting it into action by placing lunch meat into the gonzo bag and placing it on the ground to see if my dogs would take any notice of it.  They did not.  Obviously it is important to make sure that there is no residue on the outside of the bag.  I am not an affilate of gonzo bags just a fan.  It would give me a great piece of mind if we could get more vendors both international and domestic to start using this as a standard in shipping.  If any of you have heard of this product I welcome your experiences and or comments.

    a dog wouldnt react to charcoal, how they train sniffer dogs is they take the most playful one who loves toys and all that stuff, they train the dogs to make their toys smell like drugs eg rub weed on their toys so the dogs associate their toys with the smell, if a dog picks up on a smell they believe its actually their toy and they have found it, but dogs are unreliable and only get 2/5 correct.
    <br/>
    on the other hand with these charcoal bags smells no mater what it is start to permeate through anything after a period of time (microscopic holes) i'd be interested to know how long the meat was in the bag before he tested it with his dogs, being that transit times from vendor to buyer can be from 3-20 days its not guaranteed by day 15 there would be no smell?

    it doesnt work.... if you can get a hold of "how to not get busted" its a doco by an ex cop who specialized in drug squad, he explains dogs and how they pick up on things, how to conceal your stash home/car ect and even ways to handle police ..... very good watch in my opinion.

    Im sorry I forgot to mention that part, normally what I do is I will send a gonzo bag to my plug and he will fill it and send it back to me...I didnt even think about the fact that it would be pretty damn costly to do that as a vendor considering that its $27 everytime u ship.  But I can tell you that the company has been around for quite awhile and no detections as of yet.

    sorta, that part has some really good info but there's a segment that explains how they train the dogs to look for drugs, so masking things in coffee smells or herb oils doesn't mask the smells because dogs noses are wayyy better than humans they can smell something for eg with 3 things in it and smell all 3 individual things where as humans smell things as one .... I hope im making sense?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this one kinds explains a little but couldnt find the one im talking about

    LOL I guess I see how u would think that, but I swear I dont work for them.  I am just a really happy customer, and since I found out about SR the one thing that makes me uneasy is that this would be the first time I would be getting stuff sent to me without the use of a gonzo bag.  But from a cost perspective I can see why heat sealed foil would be much more cost effective.  However,  there is still a 3-5% chance that a dog may pick up on some stinky green buds.  These bags are made from guys out of the green triangle they use these things to ship 20-30lbs regularly so there has to be a lot of confidence in these things.

      Would love to hear from somebody who doesn't work for the company about the efficiency of these bags. So far every post on every forum talking about these GonzoBags is obviously paid to do so..

     LOL I guess I see how u would think that, but I swear I dont work for them.  I am just a really happy customer, and since I found out about SR the one thing that makes me uneasy is that this would be the first time I would be getting stuff sent to me without the use of a gonzo bag.  But from a cost perspective I can see why heat sealed foil would be much more cost effective.  However,  there is still a 3-5% chance that a dog may pick up on some stinky green buds.  These bags are made from guys out of the green triangle they use these things to ship 20-30lbs regularly so there has to be a lot of confidence in these things.

    They know their bags work because they use them for illegal shipping? Well, I'll get right on doing business with them, clearly nothing bad can come of this.

    This looks like something useful for people selling big quantity, like if you sell weed for example and someone buys 2lbs and you invest about 50 bucks to make sure it gets to your buyer it seems that the investment would be worth it in that case but if anyone buys those for anything other than large orders I feel bad for you son! too expensive for anything small
