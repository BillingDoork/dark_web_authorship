    Sorry, total newb here.  I am ordering steroids, and the thing is that the sellers of the best gear (not bathtub lab stuff) always seem to ship by EMS as the only timely method, or exclusively.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why?? You need to sign to recieve an EMS package.  Not only is this a major pain in the ass, that is exactly when the fuzz like to get you, as the act of signing is considered evidence that you were the importer of the drugs, were expecting the package etc.  Of course it's not a smoking gun, but yes it is evidence, and courts are a bad joke.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just want my stuff shipped by airmail or something that is fast, but does not require a signature.  It makes no sense to fuss about tracking, this is obviously a best-effort system anyway as the package could get confiscated etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With EMS I have to use my real name, or when I go to sign and show id and pick it up, they won't give me the package unless the signature matches the ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The increased risk of getting caught due to this is not nearly worth the cost of, say, ordering twice, for redundancy/two bites at the apple.  It is better to pay double (the stuff I'm getting isn't that expensive anyway).  Suppose there is an 20% chance of confiscation.  I order twice, and I get 0.2*0.2 =0.04 or 4% failure rate, which is fine, 96% success rate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if some package in someone else's name is mailed to me (especially a previous resident of my house, whose name I know), I never sign for it or anything, just find it in my mailbox one day, that's called plausible deniability.    The fuzz wouldn't even bother to prosecute I bet, even if it hit their radar.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically I want to hear what the sellers are thinking over there?  Have you never tried airmail?
