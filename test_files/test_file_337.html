    I will be visiting Morocco in the next couple of months and I was wondering the possibility of posting some back. I have done this in the past from Holland and managed to get back 50g in 3 DVD cases to the UK. This is clearly a very crude technique, but it worked partly due to the fact it was within the EU i think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone had experience in posting hash from Morocco, or indeed anywhere outside the EU to the UK. If so any advice on how to do so would be very much appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was thinking of sending it in letters each with around 3g-4g in pressed flat and send around 10 of these. Thoughts? I am planning on keeping each letter small to decrease he risk and I thought that a letter was much more unlikely to get searched than a jiffy bag would be. Any other packing tips/concealment advice would be great.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know in India you have to fill in passport details when sending stuff home. I hope this is not the case in Morocco. I suspect any post coming out of morocco is flagged. Is this correct?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance.
    <br/>

    be really careful with it. cause when they caught you , and your still in morocco you can go to jail there and i think its not as good in europe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    well best way is to vacuum pack it ofcourse . but that is no option i think . i think you wont get any problems with customs in morocco but in europe they can search it. if you send it in cd cases or dvd boxes like you did in NL you will be ok.Â  but in a normal letter and send 3-4 grams is also good. but try to vacuum pack it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and if they ask to fill in a form just do some fake details so they cant come to your hotel or something.

    You should be fine.

    <br/>
    But ultimately this depends on the integrity of the moroccon postal service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is hash actually legal in morocco then? Do you need to find "a guy" or can you just buy it on the street? Will you get scammed to fuck if you are a westerner?

    Thanks for the advice guys. Yeh I have heard horrible things about moroccan prison, not somewhere I want to end up. Yeh vacuum packing is not an option but I figure, from my very limited knowledge, letters due to the large volume of them being sent through the mail in europe are far less likely to get searched than a dvd case coming out. Know sadly hash is not legal there but is very much tolerated if you are not blatant about it. I suspect I will end up paying double for hash compared to what a local would pay but I think that still equates to around $1-$2 a gram so really cant complain :)

    We can assume you don't have a vacuum sealer with you. Maybe quadruple wrap them, then put in another envelope, then in a bigger envelope and use a label if you can get your hands on one? I like the idea of many smaller packages, then if half get caught you still have a good amount left. Maybe post them from different points so that they don't see 10 similar looking packages coming through?

    Print some labels before you go, use google to find a suitable return address and print them too.
    <br/>
    Or print up some envelopes with suitable graphics, a photoprint company would be fitting.

    Buy some proper smellproof bags before you go too, make sure they fit the envelopes :)

    Yeh I think it is fair to say I am not going to have a vacuum sealer. Lots of small packages, I agree is the way to go. I am reluctant to pack them inside to many envelopes as I feel keeping the overall weight of the package to a minimum is essential in order to try and keep it in the letter weight category (and I want the majority of the weight to be hash :)
    <br/>
    Thanks for the label printing advice pete, will look into knocking up some realistic looking stickers.
    <br/>
    Do you think it is worth my time trying to conceal it within something, such as 2 sheets of card? Just thinking realistically anything I manage to cobble together whilst traveling is not going to look too convincing + again adding more weight.

    Since you won't have a vacuum sealer available, take some heat sealable bags with you, and a travel iron (or hair straighteners, curling irons or whatever the fuck they call them).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's a guy on the forums by the name of FarmerBob who has made some interesting posts about the best materials to use for shipping. Apparently, vacuum sealing isn't really all that important, and it's more about the permeability of the materials used.Â  Do a search through his posts, or maybe send him a quick pm, if he's not too busy.

    I would advice extreme caution in trying this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hash is very commonly available in the inland mountains of Morocco, where it almost serves as a currency for tips and such. Under national law possession is strictly forbidden, and even having a gram on you could send you to prison for decades (although you will probably die there before you make it to a decade).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Walking into a casablanca post office with 20 hash filled envelopes labeled for international shipping is certainly a bad idea. You may be able to brible your way out of the situation if caught, but expect that to be very expensive. While corrupt, law enforcenent there is very aware that this bribe is a life or death matter to you, and the price will reflect that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously this situation is not unique to morocco at all, but it is important to be very aware. Common availability of a drug in a country not always means that being caught by police will end well. For most of the world i'd even say it doesn't.

    This is true. Although the same applies anywhere. The police in Morocco can be very very very strict. It's easy to lubricate them, but you have to know the right people. I've observed that being Muslim helps, it's like some kind of a brotherhood and they aren't so harsh on you if you're a Muslim.

    Right ok thanks for all the advice. Think I have got a rough idea of what I am going to do. Just want 20g's of the finest Moroccan hashish to smoke upon my arrival home :) If I can find hash of the same if not better quality than dutchcoffeeshops double zero, which is simply divine, I will be a very happy man indeed :)

    Hehe.. next time plan a couple of hours stopover at amsterdam airport - plenty of time to go into town, get the stuff and mail it to yourself. Posession of 20 grams is only a misdemeanor here, you may get a fine if caught (not likely).

    Also going to Amsterdam this summer, so plan on doing exactly that. My only issue is I hate paying coffeeshop prices for that amount. It gets expensive fast. Is there anywhere to buy discounted hash in holland? ie not through a coffeeshop? I remember in the flea market a couple of years ago getting approached about cheap hash and bud by one of the market stalls but never followed it through.

    You could always take a tram out to a residential area. Coffeeshops out of the city center are cheaper, and hash and weed are often of better quality. That's where the locals buy too.

    <br/>
    Certified coffeeshops will have a green-and-white BCD sticker that denotes their credibility. Keep in mind that you are only allowed to buy 5g from an establishment per day.

    Yeh I have been to the outskirts of amsterdam including harleem and even to rotterdam but have not actually noticed that much of a significant change in price. I was thinking that there must be a grey market of hash in such a country but I guess you would have to be a local to penetrate into such a thing.

    I suppose the best way to get a discount on 20 grams would be to somehow get a dutch person to do the purchase for you. Being dutch just puts you in a better position to negotiate prices as you will have plenty of time to leave, shop elsewhere, or perhaps come back later.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Prices in the city center of amsterdam may be on the high side for tourists in some places, but they don't really drop off much if you move away from central amsterdam. If you only visit to purchase some, i would suggest taking the train from the airport to Utrecht though. It only takes 10 minutes longer to reach, and is far less touristic, with shops offering the same prices to foreigners and locals most of the time. There is a frequent and direct train service from the airport to utrecht central station, that takes just over 30 minutes and departs every 15 minutes daytime.

    You may find a difference in price between amsterdam and utrecht as a foreigner. Amsterdam is a very touristic destination and coffeeshops there do bump prices accordingly. Utrecht is a smaller city that sees little tourism, and you are just more likely to get the same prices as dutch nationals if you shop there.

     You may find a difference in price between amsterdam and utrecht as a foreigner. Amsterdam is a very touristic destination and coffeeshops there do bump prices accordingly. Utrecht is a smaller city that sees little tourism, and you are just more likely to get the same prices as dutch nationals if you shop there.
