    SR made another appearance on a major TV network last night. The show was linking the purchasing of synthetic drugs with kids being able to buy them online and getting them delivered by mail. There were several occasions where the SR main page was shown.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The interesting part of the clip was the focus on Customs and Border Protection's international mail sorting center. Yes we all know the do's and dont's, or at least we should. They showed several conveyor belts moving articles under X-ray and a letter line-up 20 meters long with a sniffer dog running down the line. Whether the letter line-up is randomly chosen or whether they do this for all letters is unknown but it's best to assume they do this for all.

    If vendors have not introduced best practice and do not pay attention to detail, aside from address issues, your merchandise is not getting through for a good reason. Vendors need to stay ahead of LE, become innovative and never drop your standards. Aim to exceed and if in doubt, repack.

    Vendors who don't use stealth should be banned in my opinion. The reason there's not many CD's reported on SR is because there are a lot of good vendors and stealth is stressed and we have a community to discuss it. Sadly, there are still vendors, even international ones, who use no/little stealth at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I say if the package is ripped open and contents exposed, or even if the box accidently comes open, no drugs should be visible, nor anything suspicious. If all vendors merely disguised their drugs within legitimate products and seal their drugs in MBB, there would probably never be a CD ever again related to SR.
