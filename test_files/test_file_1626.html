    Hi, Everyone!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Long time lurker. First time poster. An interesting situation has come in to place; as of recently, my next door neighbor's house has been foreclosed on and they have since moved out. Now, this is bad news bears all around and makes me pretty fucking sad. But be that as it may, there's an unoccupied home right next door to me. How savvy would it for me to just use that for my receiving address on all shipments in the near future. What amount of time will needed to have passed before someone starts getting suspicious that this empty house is STILL getting packages? I'm in the US if it matters.

    Care to elaborate on that? Recently vacant houses get mail all the time from people/companies that don't know they don't live there.

    Its a dumb idea in the US for sure and probably the rest of the world.  Anyone who moves for whatever reason, foreclosures count, the person goes to the post office and fills out a change of address form.  Basically you put your name on it your old address (the foreclosed house) and your new address and check the box at the bottom for three, six or nine months.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now that the change of address form has been completed and turned over to the clerk all the mail that was supposed to go to that house is now forwarded to their new address.  It's free and everyone does it so they can get their mail after moving,  They will then have to call all of the senders (banks, bills, magazines, everything) and give them their new address so once the forwarding service is terminated they will still get their mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if you think you are going to send it to the foreclosed house with your name or a dummy name, THAT IS STUPID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DO NOT USE A FORECLOSED HOUSE PLEASE?!?!?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace

    Here in the Uk they have to let the post office know they are moving, and all mail to that address with the owners name on will be redirected to the new house. All you will be doing is sending it to them, So if you liked them that much, go ahead! :P

    Your neighbours probably are getting their mail forwarded to the new address... but it would only be mail addressed to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you use a fake name the mail won't be forwarded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The problem would be if you somehow do get caught... good luck explaining that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I remember watching a episode of Drugs Inc... Ketamine i think.. and a dealer there was using a foreclosed house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other hand.. this was a dealer using a foreclosed house... on TV... and they showed the house on TV...
    <br/>

    He might not be the best role model.

    If you do attempt this, be sure to do a test by sending a dumby letter to the address first, if it arrives then you're in business, if it doesn't then forget about it.

    As previously mentioned the forwarding is very commons so use a different name.

    this is incorrect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i'm originally from canada, and currently living in the UK, and in both of those countries in all of the houses/apartments i've rented out i've gotten letters for the previous tenants.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    currently the flat i'm living in in the uk is getting mail for over 5 previous tenants weekly, to this day, and none of them have lived here for over a year.

    so, in other words, i'm fairly certain if you use a fake name, and you're not too worried about the chances of your package getting lost, then there's not much you should be worried about getting busted if you order to that house.

    No you don't. I've moved several times and never told the Post Office. It's none of their goddamn business. I just tell everyone who sends me post and problem solved!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want the Post Office to redirect your post you have to pay some ridiculous redirection fee. (£50.00 for 3 months I believe).

    best advice is this^...i personally am against the idea of using a foreclosed home as dummy address too much risk for you and the vendor
