    So I enjoy getting all hypothetical &amp; there are a few thing I've been thinking about RE PO Boxes that I'll throw out for some brainstorming:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. When checking the box would you prefer to dress for the occasion (business) and check during peak hour, hiding amongst the hundred others collecting mail? Or would you prefer to put on your ninja suit and check it around midnight? Do you go straight to the box to grab it and walk away or do you case the block &amp; hang around the boxes for a smoke while making sure your not being watched?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Is it ok to get multiple PO Boxes in the same name in 5 different towns or will Post Office link them all to one account &amp; wonder why you have 5 boxes spread up the coast?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. Any ideas for opening boxes under a business name without registering a business or ABN or anything? I feel like registering as a business would work well for #2.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Everything I receive has already been paid for &amp; will be posted domestic (NON SR). I really like the idea of only having the package in my hand for the '10 steps' from my mailbox to the outgoing box but if I were to have pre-made envelopes with my buyers drop details on me when I pickup then that could cause all sorts of problems for both myself &amp; the buyer if shit were to hit the fan... Any ideas on getting envelopes from my box, packaged for delivery &amp; into the outgoing box with the absolute minimal handling by myself?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5. What services do you sign up for to keep a regular flow of incoming legit mail?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    6. PO Box is under a fake ID. Would you order lots of small packages or a few larger ones (that will still fit in the box)? Order 5 at once &amp; check the box in 2 months to collect all arrivals or order 1 per month (re-order on successful arrival) and check soon after arrival?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything else...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've already done my thinking and have my answers to the above but I enjoy the topic &amp; after browsing all the other PO Box questions I couldn't find much discussion on some of the above.

    This is why I logged in today, just to ask this question.  If I try to open a PO box with a fictitious DL, am I going to be screwed?  I can have someone generate fake "proof" that I live in that area, but will my fake Ohio DL get run through a database?

    Ok. So I'm wiggin out a little. I have a medium-large box &amp; have sent myself some domestic post, A4 size and they put it in the box no worries collected it as expected &amp; proceeded to place my first OS order. The test package I ordered is under 5g &amp; was supposedly sent in an envelope but when I checked my box I was devo to see a slip to collect mail from the post office. Now I'm racking my brain. Why the fuck would they hold a small envelope from a trusted country &amp; require me to collect it unless I'm getting a CD for &lt;5g?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to just walk in and collect it like a normal person but this wasn't the plan. They were supposed to drop it in my box and other than a CD I can't see why else they would do this... The only thing that it has going for it is that the postage time was as quick as can be expected +/- 1 day. I can't see them jumping through the customs hoops and arranging a CD for a small  (marketable quantity) and still maintaining such quick delivery.... What would you do?

    It depends on the shipping method that the vendor uses. Some express services require a signature, regardless of the size. A quick PM to the vendor will sort out whether or not this is the case. If a  signature is indeed required, then the Post office will do exactly that, put a slip in your PO box for collection.  Its an academic discussion anyway. You know that eventually you will go in to collect, no matter what. :)

    It's a very well respected vendor from a "safe" country and no signature required on the postal method I chose. I'm willing to walk away if that is advised. I'm under $1k in and can afford to lose that &amp; keep playing if needed but obviously I'd rather not. Maybe I'm just looking for someone to give me a pat and say"she'll be right mate" but fuck I just can't see anything but CD being the reason for this fucking collection slip  :-\

    I'd like to advise you one way or another but I just don't have enough experience. I guess the other thing is to contact the vendor with regards to packaging and how it was declared on the customs form including its value and see if it stacks up against the listed VAT charges for imports. It may not have been sent in an envelope. Good luck with it! Maybe a veteran will see this thread and offer some better advice.

    Have confirmed with the vendor that it is sent via envelope with no signature required &amp; he says / I can see from his listings that all his packages are still arriving to Aus ok. It also  appears to have cleared customs fine in the tracking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bring on some veterans advice. How should I get this bitch... Or should I leave it &amp; start again?

    Did you open your PO Box at at United States Post Office?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would suggest opening it somewhere else (a mom and pop PO Box center would be ideal)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for using a fake business name, go through the local process to register a business using your real information (should cost you less than $100)....then you will have paperwork to go with whatever business you register....scan that paperwork, open up photoshop and change whatever details you want. Now you have a fake business with legit paperwork to open a PO Box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for questions regarding specific PO Box Center practices, utilize good ol fashioned social engineering, come up with a backstory to tell them and then ask questions that are innocent but will still reveal the information you are looking for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for how you pick up the package, you always want to draw the least amount of attention to yourself. Sunglasses and a hoodie aren't a good idea. Besides, when you opened your box they made a copy of your ID anyway didn't they? They already have your face on file.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are super paranoid and can convince a friend to work with you, have a friend register the box using a fake ID, then you can be the one that picks up packages. If you don't look alike, this will present a dead-end for LE conducting an investigation.

    Thanks for the reply. The box is opened at Australia Post in South Australia and when opening it they didn't even pick my ID up off the counter let alone scan it - So no they don't have my face on file other than what they can grab from CCTV.  Thanks for the tips on getting the business doc's together. Guess I could replicate it with a real businesses details, which will come in handy once I open my next PO Box at a mom &amp; pop op (already got the paperwork).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've decided to find my balls &amp; take the risk I signed up for and go get my letter but fuck I'm freaking out. I was never supposed to see a collection slip, they were supposed to just put it in the box like a good postal drug courier! I'll maybe check my box some time in the coming nights to clean out anything else that's in there &amp; will head back in at 6am to see what happens with this slip.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any further advice on why they would put a collection slip in my empty box for a small envelope? Only one reason I can see and it's far from preferable :/

    If that's the only reason you can see for this happening then why are you going to pick it up?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't go and get it in your position - going there to pick it up you have zero plausible deniability.
    <br/>

    Do you really want a criminal record over five grams? (Five grams of what?)

    For what it's worth, I've gotten the slip in my box twice now to come sign for it when I know I didn't have to.  In the end, I decided to just man up and go up to the counter.  Post offices fuck up a lot, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was a mistake like it has been twice for me now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as plausible deniability, you're throwing that out the window either way.  Taking a package from your box and walking out is just the same as signing for it at the counter, so I wouldn't factor that into your decision.  If it were them leaving a note at your door to come pick up a package they wouldn't deliver that'd be a completely different story, but it's not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My opinion is that you just go get it.  Unless it's LSD crystal or some nbome substance, LE isn't going to give a flying fuck about 5g.  They would've just sent you a love letter, not stationed an officer at the post office to wait for days on end for you to come take ownership of &lt;$1000 worth of illicit substances.

    This thread has gone quiet. I wonder if he picked up his package? In any case I eventually found out from a newspaper article that when an Item is seized in Aus, the intended recipient may receive a customs declaration slip asking them to collect in person. Its actually an interesting read about the profile of a middle-class, middle aged, recreational drug user.

    Can happily say I did pick up my package and everything was just fine. It was shipped in a hard parcel which had no bend so it must have been just that tiny bit too big for my box. I was planning to update but I just didn't want to do it the moment I picked it up. I didn't have to sign, just gave them the slip &amp; box number. Figured if they took any longer than a minute I was gonna be doing a runner, 10-20 seconds later I had an 8ball in my hands :)

    Fgn stoked!
