    Has anyone sent to Singapore?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no problem with it In principle I think, but should something go wrong, the reciever could be facing years in jail and lashes.Â  It would be death for them for just 5 or 10 grams I think, of coke or heroin.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    would you send there knowing what could happen to your client?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I did send I would make sure it was only a small amount, not enough for a hanging...........
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Imagine if it was a setup and you sent without knowing a package that ended in a score being settled and an execution, perhaps a jilted lover, or sacked employee.......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    God maybe I won't do it.........
    <br/>
    <br/>
    your thoughts please............

    And in Singapore its a MANDATORY death sentence for 15 grams of heroin or more, so I probably wouldn't send more than 1 or 2 g's at a time..
