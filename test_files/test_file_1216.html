    My first orders on SR were shipped to my friend's house and we used the previous resident's name on the packages because they still received mail for him every so often. I recently moved out and live on my own now. I know the previous resident's name but I haven't received any of their mail while living here. Would it be a bad idea f I tried to get a SR package sent here in the previous resident's name? It worked perfectly at my friends house. We received multiple domestic and non-domestic letters. Even a vial of LSD one time which was the best shit ever.

    I think she might get her mail forwarded now which would certainly not work out too well... lol But I don't want to risk using my real name because I already got in trouble for getting weed shipped from a friend in Colorado using UPS (before I knew about SR) and I am sure they definitely watch my name now.

    Totally reckless to use someone else's name, particularly the previous resident, because USPS is supposed to forward to the new address (assuming they filed the request, which it sounds like they did).  Your mailman learns your name and may get suspicious or not deliver mail with a random name on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suppose if you were getting something in a business envelope it could be addressed to "Resident" like junk mail often is, assuming vendor would agree to that.  It's probably more likely to randomly get lost in the mail doing that though.

    Ambiguous details would be helpful in addressing the watch-issue. You've moved, did you move out of state? Are you still in the same mail district? How "big" was the offense? Did you actually get arrested, or was it a letter?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's easy to assume they will trace you by name wherever you go, but to a certain degree I don't think the USPS is all that intelligent. Addresses get marked, I don't know about names. At least, in the other threads regarding overall postal policy, I didn't see much about names - only addresses. I suppose in my head, the logic would sound more like... if you made a mistake at an address, then it is easier to believe that you wouldn't move - but you would change your name, so there is more value to watching a single address. Plus, depending on how far you moved, communication in our country between municipal/city/state/federal departments isn't exactly noteworthy. I know of some cities that are still primarily on paper ticketing and old VT100 terminals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ultimately, using someone elses name also falls into mail tampering. If it has their name on it, it is theirs. If you open that mail, you've tampered with THEIR mail. I don't like the idea of ever doing that, no more than using a fake name to get a PO box. Too many ways it could go WAY wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think the standard methods stand. If you are in a new area, and you don't (and shouldn't) receive at your residence, its time to develop relationships with people you can trust in that department. If you want to avoid using your name, that is the only option I can really recommend. Like I said about mail tampering and fraud... I don't like that concept, but there absolutely is the potential for using scans and getting a POBox like many others here.

    It was actually sent to a local UPS location where I went to pick it up and was arrested. I couldn't get it sent to my house because I lived with my parents. I am still dealing with it in court right now but things are looking good. I moved about 15-20 miles from where I was caught previously. The charge is possession with intent. And like I said, it was through UPS and not USPS. It was my second attempt and I got away with the first one. I am in the central US.

    If you're in a new apt, you could always be living with someone, right? Boyfriend, girlfriend, roommate? Go right to the post office and tell them your roommate is moving in, and you just wanted to give the name, so they get their mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Invent a roommate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe first mail a few letters to your address, with the new name on there, and see if they come.

    I used my cat's name on a coupon website for pet toys, and somehow he now gets mail! Even got credit card offers for "Mr Tar" LoL!

    Good luck, and be careful.

    does the postman in USA keep track of everyone's details and verify before sending or some crap?
    <br/>
    In Australia you can use literally any name you like... as long as the name and addy (remember both have to match, because obviously heaps and heaps of people have the same first and last name) aren't being forwarded you are good to go.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Surely in USA the postman won't go "oh john smith at 123 blah street... that doesn't sound right" ?

    I have seen some apartments, where inside of the postal boxes there is a list of the tenants name taped in.

    You could probably get away with adding a made up room mate to the names on the postal box.

    If you are facing charges for receiving drugs in the mail, I would personally recommend you wait it out and see how that case goes. If you get caught again you are going to get the book thrown at you.

    Buy domestic LSD for now.  Maybe it isn't as good as the drops but you've got serious charges pending right now.  Blotter paper is also easier to hide.  Keep your place clean enough so that the police won't find anything if they issue a search warrant.  You never know.  Good luck beating the charges.
