    Okay, this was my first SR transaction although I am a vetran  when it comes to shipping and receiving packages.  This is also my first package that I would be receiving internationally.  The package was supposed to arrive from EU and was sent TNT express. The date it was supposed to come was New Years Eve.  It did not show.  I tracked it and saw that it left Chicago on 12/29/12, keep in mind I paid an extra $100 to have it sent express so it was supposed to arrive in 3 days.  Furthermore this package contained a very small amount of contraband.  An amount smaller than 80mgs.  My main concern is after it left Chicago on 12/29/12 it says the next place it arrived at was "USA Other" where it labled it as "Forwarded for Delivery" I am not familiar with TNT express, but why did it not say EXACTLY where it was especially since it was already in the US since it was in Chicago 2 days ago.  Does this mean that it was forwarded for controlled delivery?  I guess I am just kind of spooked.  Any experiences or advice would be helpful.  Lastly, I ordered the package to be sent with tracking and NO signature confirmation.

    You should wait a bit before getting all frightened up. It's not uncommon for the tracking numbers to be a bit messy or for a package to arrive late even if shipped through priority or express.

    go to a pay phone and ring up asking where it is.  It's not unusual for someone to be tracking down a package.  If they ask for your name give them another name say your sending  it to a family member as a birthday present and its late or something.  I have done this before when tracking  down SR orders.

    From my research if they tell you that they dont know where it is then it has been seized but since it says forward for delivery you should be ok.  With new years and public holidays just wait another couple of days.
