    hey everyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i made a order with a very well known vendor early yesterday and asked them will it be possible to get my order out today for delivery tomorrow (Today/Friday).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They said yes no problems 2 hours later it was marked in transit so i thought i should receive it today no problems however it did not arrive and i find that very strange considering im in the next day delivery zone and so are they.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I asked for the tracking number and got it......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tracked the mail and it came back as no results found.....i can see that it is express but has not been scanned yet. express post for me gets scanned the night of pickup and i can see by the morning that it is on board for delivery.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    what does everyone think may have happend?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im thinking the vendor may not have sent it entill today and it wont get scanned entill tonight or Auspost are being very dodgy and slow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i get really paranoid about this kind off stuff and want to be sure im all good as i want to order my stuff!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    cheers dolmio

    I know a little about AUS post, im from USA though, but i have a sister there and she sends me some things and sometimes it Pack n track or International express depending on how bad i need them..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And Auspost tracking is shit bro.. It is not very detailed AT ALL!! I mean i have checked AUS post, and it be about 5 things behind what it says on USPS Tracking..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now as far as the express, he may not have dropped it off in time for it to be deliverd the next day, that is a big issue people do not understand, if the seller does not have that express pack to the PO by a cut offf time it will not 100% arrive the next day..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but u also say the TRACK SAYS NO RESULTS? That can be 2 things in my experiance..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. It has not had time for acceptance at the PO to be scanned into the system
    <br/>
    2 he did not ship it like he was suppose to, or also it happends everytime with my sis she will mess up a digit and make it say no results, cause B AND 8 some times look the same will confuse some ppl..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    u need to contact the seller, and tell him to DOUBLE CHECK AND GIVE U THE TRACKING AGAIN, TELL HIM TO CHECK IT, AND THEN BECAUSE U PAID FOR EXPRESS AND HE FAAILED TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN U NEED TO TELL HIM HE OWES U SOME MONEY BACK ON SHIPPING, AND IF HE IS A ASS ABOUT IT, TELL HIM YOU CAN LET REOLUTION HANDLE IT, WHICH I ALWAYS TRY TO AVOID AND SO DO VENDORS, SO MOST COMPROMISE..AFTER BEING A HARD ASS.. YA GOTTA LET THESE VENDORS KNOW AS A BUYER YOU ARE NOT GONNA BE FUKED OVER MATE.. TRUSTME, IV BEEN HERE OVER A YEAR ALMOST 100 BUYS, I KNOW THE DRILL, IV BEEN LUCKY AND NEVERHAD NE ISSUES AND ALWAYS GOT MY STUFF, SOMETIMES LATE BUT ALWAYS AND NORMALLY WITH XTRA..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT U GOTTA LET T BE KNOWN, "HEY BRO I DIDNT PAY U 30BUCKS OR HOWEVER MUCH FOR EXPRESS AND U FAIL ON YOUR END"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LIKE IV SAID IN other replies iv left any u newer guys that need advice on anything PM me im glade to help, i have always tried to help ppl not be screwed, i hate to see that.

    yeah thanks alot mate :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it`s hard to say but he is a top vendor on here under %4.
    <br/>
    by the looks off things im guessing he didnt get my package out entill today when he agree`d to have it out yesterday for delivery today.
    <br/>
    So yea i payed for express and it def wont be express now!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor said if it doesnt turn up they will resend it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for express delivery`s AUSpost offer`s to resend a free express satchel if the package is not delivery`d within the next day delivery zone so to make it fair i guess the vendor owes me free shipping next time. presuming this package arrives ;)

    also its too hard to say if AUSpost are at fault or the vendor is as AUSpost sometimes stuff up and take a few days.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im wondering if mail gets scanned in at the depots of a Friday night in Australia?
