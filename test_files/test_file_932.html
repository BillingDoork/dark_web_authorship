    Okay, we all know there is a 13 oz rule with USPS, but weed dealers get over that rule by just going up to the USPS counter and paying postage in cash, can this be done as securely with let's say, a handgun? Or do they have more bomb/gun sniffing dogs at every check point rather than drug dogs?  If so, why don't many people already do this?

    Only thing I can think of is guns might be easier to detect (maybe) or easier thus more people get away with it. Who knows there may be more people shipping firearms than we know.

    handguns can easily be broken down into its most base components (example a springfield xd is like 4 parts) so maybe you could break the gun down to slide, handle/frame, recoil spring, and barrel. this would help get the weight under probably, and i think it would help with it getting there to be broken down maybe. alot of "replacement" parts could be bought from sites and shipped from sites like gunbroker. so there is a whole lot of people shipping guns on the regular. obviously the type of handgun will have a lot to do with how ud ship it. but as big as the gun craze is these days and as much things being bought from sites that sell guns online and ship to your local FFL id say it shouldnt be to hard to get through. especially again if its broken down, then it would look just parts. the gun stores recieve their shipments through mail too, its just another item to them as long as its not loaded its just metal. im sure it goes with out saying a good clean down would be a good idea before shipping to get any gsr off. and id start with a mag first then the other parts that are not engraved with a s. number (legal to transfer so shouldnt even raise suspicion ) then do the frame, and slide last. i rember being at a gun store when they got a load in and the skinny ups/fed ex cant really remember which it was had a fucking card of guns and the guy at the counter just signed for em like regular mail.and i know people who sold on gunbroker and the just sent clean rifels in boxes wrapped in bubble wrap and no probs. im not sure what they told the person at the counter if they asked but there may even be some info on gunbroker on how to ship i dunno but might be worth checkin out if ur studying up. just high n came across this n figured id drop in my thoughts i seen holly started the thread n it cought my attention i thought holly was "cool" when i first found sr. learned alot from their post.

    Good advice except for one part. The slide of a handgun is technically considered a part. The frame of a handgun (or the receiver on a rifle) is what the ATF considers the actual "gun." It is legal to ship all firearm parts and rifles from person to person in the US. The exception is with handgun receivers. Those are illegal to mail via USPS and must be shipped from FFL to FFL (Federal Firearms License) via UPS or Fedex and must be declared. If I were going to ship a handgun receiver illegally I would hide it very well in a much larger package with lots of other metal labeled "auto parts" or "motorcycle parts."

    im sure the auto parts would be good if one were to be asked whats in there anything thats a metal tool ex big wrench would be close to weight size and shape. and for fun last night when i got off i looked on gunbroker website and there is a tips for sellers section, then a shipping advice section there was a lot of info there that would be worth checking out.

    Breaking the gun down into component parts shipped as "auto parts" is a great idea and would almost certainly succeed domestically - even if the package was inspected, how many typical postal workers would be able distinguish a gun part from auto parts?  I think safest would be to send at least two separate packages including both gun parts and legit auto parts mixed together (you can get junk auto parts for old cars for next to nothing, so the extra cost is negligible).  Even UPS/FedEx could probably be used for this so long as the gun part was mixed with lots of other auto parts because, again, your typical worker can't distinguish gun parts from auto parts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shipping internationally is another story though.  It seems extremely risky, both risk of confiscation and risk that buyer gets arrested for "international arms trafficking" or something, and in countries with strict gun control laws (like Mexico) the buyer would be looking at serious prison time - much more than they'd get for receiving drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another big problem with shipping "auto parts" internationally is that many countries have tariffs or taxes or other obstacles to prevent foreign countries shipping cheap parts that undersell the domestic parts suppliers.  The package might get inspected BECAUSE it is marked "auto parts."  There's probably a very significant chance the package would be opened and inspected.  Also, I may be wrong, but I believe in the US you have to fill out a customs declaration when you claim to be sending parts overseas. If so, you'd have to use a fake ID when you fill out and sign the declaration.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm trying to think of a large metal item that is frequently shipped internationally but that wouldn't raise flags for customs and tax collectors on both sides of the border.  Drawing a blank :o

    In my understanding, only the receiver of a firearm is illegal to ship, any other parts are completely legal. For example, on an ar-15 only the lower reviever is illegal to ship without a FFL dealer involved. I can buy barrels, lower parts kit, handguards, etc right to my door.

    What about various forms of modern "art"? Some sculpturey crap. Take a bunch of scrap metal, cobble it together in whatever shape with your parts hidden inside.
