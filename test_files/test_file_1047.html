    I want to mail 4 ounces of coke domestically. I see everyone mentioning $5.60 flat rate shipping. Do I have to use one of those flat rate envelopes or boxes? Can I use my own bubble envelope? Can I vacuum seal the coke 3 times and use a bubble mailer and put a $5.60 stamp on it and drop it in the blue box? When I calculate postage online it tells me that it will cost $6.95.

    The flat rate envelopes might be $5.60 but the small flat-rate boxes are a little more.... something like $5.80 but I can't remember for sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The flat-rate prices are ONLY when using the "flat rate" envelopes or boxes available from USPS.  If you use your own bubble mailer then you have to pay per ounce.  I highly recommend using a flat-rate box so that there isn't any ambiguity about the price.  You may want to send a test package or at least not send all 4oz of coke at once since you're a little unsure on this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you mail from the USPS counter then you can get a tracking number for free.  However, they may then have you on camera.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't depend on plastic vacuum sealing to keep out the scent.  For that you need MBBs (moisture barrier bags).  Either way be sure not to get cocaine residue on anything in the package (eg from cocaine dust in the air, touching package with fingers that have cocaine on them, etc).

    You want to mail a qp of cocaine in a bubble mailer? I feel sorry for the recipient of that package..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But in all seriousness, you probably want to use the medium Priority flat rate box. It's like $12 and includes tracking for free. Should be big enough to be able to disguise a qp of coke if you break down the rocks so it's only powder. Worse comes to worse, use the large box. The $20 shipping fee is well worth it to be able to stealthily send that much coke, compared to the jail time and court fines and fees you'll receive for trying to mail that much coke....in a bubble mailer lol. I would definitely read up a lot more on shipping tactics and techniques before sending that much...I may even suggest breaking it up into 2-4 different packages

    Unless you bring it to the counter the package needs to be under 13oz.

    Thank you everyone.
