    Good news, the USPS online store is now giving away the free 500ct rolls of tracking numbers that they had previously said they were not going to give out.  Some local PO's may have them to offer, but I talked to the largest PO in my area and the teller said that USPS is trying hard to limit the amount of extra forms, etc to its physical locations and they didn't have the rolls.::

    But the big problem is, if you order them thay can be correlated to your mailing address. The numbers on them will be pointing to you if by chance a package is ordered by LE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do you get around this?

    The Movement still ships packages with DCN ANONYMOUSLY! We have ways of acquiring tracking and we have been using it since USPS phased out the old tracking Jan. 27. Havent had a problem yet. If any vendor is interested in our methods we will gladly give up the info.....for a price!!

    I thought about it too that USPS might correlate the index range of numbers to my home address, but something tells me that they don't keep that recorded.  Most likely all that is recorded is the inventory item number and quantity ordered, as it would be the only item with a range value.

    The new "400" series Tracking option is not fool proof as silly people do silly things - if you get a roll via a purchase to your home addy they now know the Tracking numbers sequentially. We hit random smaller PO's for smaller amounts 25-50 at a time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Should you do the blue box drop and walk... you'll see an increased time for them to be tracked ( one case was 4 days) delivery was 7 days on Priority.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've a random bum that goes to local PO's hat and sunglass style and has a great reason for them to provide him with the stickers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They are not IMO a suitable replacement for green DCN's yet
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Net, net USPS wants to obtain additional shipping information surrounding the shipper.

    Really though, this info is already part of their database, what makes you think they take the extra step to erase it?

    I was told recently that the Free tracking on priority mail is only if you buy the postage online or take the package to the counter. She claimed that even if you have the "400 labels" you have to pay $0.90 more postage for tracking if you drop in a blue box with stamps. I'm not even sure she was saying you could add the extra postage as stamps? I don't trust this information although she seemed to think she was an expert on the subject. She gave me a bunch of different bar code labels she said did not add tracking (even though they say "USPS Tracking #" in bold print) but would keep the package moving through their system faster. These labels are not #400 and do not have the little extra strip on the bottom with a copy of the tracking number to keep.
