    Just wait until your order is processed and while you are waiting do some research on here.

    Probably.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The greyed out options you describe means your package hasn't been marked in transit yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Most likely the vendor can't fill your order right away or hasn't gotten around to it. They're people too, and when real life happens it generally takes priority over sending out SR orders (not saying it's a great business practice, but it's true).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your bitcoins haven't been released to the vendor yet, so it's unlikely to be any scamming activity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're concerned, write to the vendor and (politely) ask if they need anything else from you to complete the transaction.

    I would add that it is a good rule to message a vendor before your first transaction with them to make sure they respond, tell you that everything is good and to discuss any special arrangements or considerations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In two more days you will be able to cancel the order unless the vendor moves it to transit.  Have you sent a message to the vendor at all? If this is your first purchase on SR it is usually a must too communicate with the vendor.  Did you choose a reliable vendor? Do any research?
