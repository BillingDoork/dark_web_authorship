    All right, so. It's been about 14 days since I've placed an order that was shipping US domestic. About 5 days ago, I messaged vendor to check the DCN, and they said it should be here sometime this week (in about 2-3 business days to be exact). Well, it's been 5 business days, so should I be worried? It's under a 1/4 oz of bud, so I can't imagine getting a controlled delivery or anything, but still... I got a little spooked, and I checked the vendor's review thread. A few others seem to have been in my same exact situation so I'm assuming USPS was just slow with this set of shipments for whatever reason. It looks like their packages arrived today, so I'm hoping mine will be here by tomorrow. Assuming that it is, or else gets here by early next week, is it safe for me to place more orders to the same address? Does anyone know if packages taking an unusually long time to arrive domestically is a sign that you're being ~watched in any way? I hope I'm just being paranoid, but before I place any more orders to the same address, it'd be great to have some reassurance.
    <br/>

    Thanks,

    I was afraid of that, but it's a really reputable vendor so I hope that's not the case  :( I guess maybe somebody at the post office could have picked it up too. Either way, I'm honestly less concerned about getting scammed (it wasn't a huge order, after all) and more worried about getting the address I used flagged. Thanks for you input though! Hopefully it all works out in the end.

    Which vendor? Let us know, that way if you got scammed others will know. Maybe the package was seized?

    I'd like to give the vendor the benefit of the doubt. I'll give it a few more business days, and if nothing shows, I'll send them another message to see what they say. I'll report back here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suppose it could have been seized, which is the part that makes me uneasy. I'm not sure how exactly that goes down. Do seizures happen often domestically? Are you sent any kind of notice if your items are seized or does LE just head straight for a controlled delivery? Like I said, I can't imagine them doing that for such a little amount that's obviously for personal use, but what do I know lol. I guess I'll just wait it out the best I can.

    i dont understand why people dont want to say the vendor they ordered from... especially when they asking questions about their order
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you arent saying he scammed you, you are just stating the fact your order hasnt arrived but if you want help its beneficial to know which vendor so people can give you info about their own previous orders
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my guess would also be that your order didnt ship when the vendor said it was, but without knowing which one theres no idea what happened
    <br/>
    <br/>
    generally youd get a notice about seizure but it would be a while after - not likely to get a CD for a quarter

    I've had orders from addresses that are a 20 minute drive from me take 5+ day's to arrive, so if I were you I wouldn't be too worried, USPS etc. is just sucking balls cuz of cutbacks recession whatever bullshit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    microRNA is also riight, many vendors will put your order into processing ... long before they actually ship it.  Of course this is a STUPID thing for vendors to do, but many of them do it, so he coulda put it into processing at the beginning of the week and just not put it in the mail until the end of the week (sloppy and annoying ! )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should ask the vendor to check the DCN of your order and see what it's status is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If something is seized you will receive a letter, they won't setup a controlled delivery based on the first seizure at an address (esp. if its a small quantity ... they might flag that address though), it's expensive to their (LE) budget to setup sting's so their only going to target addresses that have either had a few seizures, or the seizure was for a large quantity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say LE is least of your worries, you either got scammed by the vendor, a postal worker stole it from you, it fell off a conveyor or was misrouted to the wrong bin at the sorting facility (in which case you'll still get it ... it'll just take until they find it) or it was shipped to the wrong address (either by you mistyping you're own address or the vendor being sloppy and not copying your address letter for letter).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll get more answers out of the vendor then the forums so you should ask him to check the DCN
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I PERSONALLY would hold off on ordering to that address, but that's only cuz I have many sucessful transactions, so one that's just taking way to look would seem suspect to me.  It's different in your case if your a new buyer though, it could just be the USPS centers in your region and how bad they are compared to other areas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't get paranoid though, if they seized it they will most definitely send you a love letter if this is the first seizure to that address.
