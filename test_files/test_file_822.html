    Why would it be any different to other places in Europe? Is Estonia tougher on drugs or boarders or something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *Much of a drug culture in Estonia? I'm planning a trip there sometime

    I don't know but I've seen some vendors don't ship to Estonia. Also its a small country so I guess stuff gets intercepted more easily.
    <br/>
    I think there's more of a drinking culture than a drug culture.

    I'm interested in this as well. I don't know anything specific about Estonian postal system or customs, but in general the impression that we Finns have on Estonia is that regulations and law enforcement in general are not as strict there as they are here, which is naturally no surprise taking into account the quite extreme strictness of the Finnish system. People tend to go to Estonia to get drugs as the pharmacies and doctors there have a reputation of giving pills easily - no idea how true this is these days. My gut says shipping to Estonia is probably as easy as shipping to most European countries is, but it's just the gut. Would be interested in actually knowing.
