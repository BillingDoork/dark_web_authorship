    Hello Everyone :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am fairly new to SR (finally secured some bitcoins) and totally new to the forum.  I am about to make my first purchase, but I could really use some advice before i finalize (...to ease my nervousness a bit). I know that similar topics have been covered before, but I couldn't find any posts that answered my specific question. So, here goes: ...I'm uber nervous about having things sent to my house under my name.  Unfortunately, I haven't had any luck finding any friends or family that would be willing to receive my package at their address using their name.  My grandfather, whose house I live in, passed away in January. I was considering using his name and my (our?) address to receive stuff. Good idea? No? ...We still receive tons of mail addressed to him.  My fiance thinks it's a great idea, but I'm still really nervous about having anything sent here. What do y'all think? Would it be relatively safe (all things considered) to have things shipped here using his name? So that, if the unthinkable occurs, I could claim ignorance seeing as how it wouldn't be addressed to moi? ....Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks! &lt;3

    You could do that if you were really that nervous about having things adressed to you. There might be a chance though that the pack wouldn't make it due to him being deceased. For example, we still get junk mail from the previous tenants at our place but all the important mail such as tax returns, bank statements get forwarded or something else and never make it to our place. So I'm just wondering in your case what they do with a dead guys mail(sorry). I would say just order it in your name or whoever's name is on the lease/mortgage of the place you're staying at.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The whole message I think all the stickies are trying to convey here is rather than taking some obscure ass path to receiving your packs, just try to make them blend in as best as possible with the rest of the mail, raise no flags with false names, abandoned buildings, non-existant tenants, etc.

    Use your own name, and own address on packages. If the police bust in, it's not going to matter who's name is on the package when you're the one holding it. Your plausible deniability when using your own name though is a lot stronger than when using a dead person's: "I have no idea who would have sent me this package, but I want to speak to my lawyer before I answer any more of your questions" is a lot more believable than "I have no idea who would send my deceased grandfather a gram of weed/cocaine/methamphetamine etc., but I want to speak to my lawyer before I answer any more of your questions even though this wasn't addressed to me."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look at it logically: if you use your deceased grandfather's name on a package of drugs, it's a lot more likely that you ordered them than he did. Unless of course there's some sort of new SR Afterlife service that I missed the memo about. When it's addressed to you, you can also argue the point that somebody is trying to ruin your good name by sending you drugs in the mail; if it were addressed to your grandfather, who exactly would be benefiting from ruining your deceased grandfather's good name? Nobody.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use your head, and never ever Finalise Early on a package if that's what you are intending on doing. ALWAYS stay within Escrow. You've got more of a risk of getting scammed by not following Silk Road best practices than you do of the police breaking down your door to arrest your dead grandfather for ordering narcotics over the internet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Welcome to Silk Road; I hope you have an enjoyable and fruitful time here. We have a great community built up, but make sure you never let your guard down, never release any personal information of any kind, learn how to use PGP and ALWAYS encrypt sensitive details when placing your orders, never Finalize Early unless you're willing to accept the possibility of losing your money, and don't forget to finalize when you've received your product and update your feedback once you've tried it.

    I've seen lots of ideas and lots of advice on here- some good some horrible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Really bad ideas....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Using vacant dwellings
    <br/>
    Your package will be sent to return address as  "unknown" or "Vacant"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your mailman is NOT supposed to deliver to vacant dwellings
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Using the name of a former resident
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your mailman will forward the package (if they put in a forwarding address) or return to the sender as "Forwarding order expired" if they moved a long time ago. If they moved but did not put in a forwarding address he will return it as "Moved left no forwarding address"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now some might think "BS! I get mail all the time for people that used to live here."
    <br/>
    Check again--that mail is junkmail and if you look closely it most likely also includes the phrase "or current resident" that would be you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before you think..."AHA! I will use the former resident name and include "or current resident" guess what? Now you have drawn attention to yourself because no one sends first class mail with "current resident". Except for maybe....guess who?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now some of you might think "BS! I have got first class mail for the person who used to live here!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is because it is not a perfect system and if your mailman was on vacation and a new hire was doing the route who is getting paid half what he was and has no benefits They don't know shyt--they don't know who lives where or who moved until they have some experience on the route. If you want to take the chance that your mailman is on vacation or sick, and the person doing the route that day is new (it could very well be a veteran who is doing overtime) then go ahead and hope the 2% chance that it will work will work--I don't think that would be very smart though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your mailman will return mail for dead relatives as "deceased"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BTW Postal Inspectors are NOT stupid. Quite the contrary. In any case if your dead grandpa is getting pot or coke in the mail at your address guess what they are going to be sure of?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Bottom line is this----
    <br/>
    Your mailman may know who lives at your address, but he does not know when someone new just moved in, and he doesn't know when you have friends or relatives staying with you for a day, or a month, or a year. There are rare exceptions to this for example on some apartment complexes with lots of apartments and a high move in move out rate some places require you put names on the boxes. If that is the case then just put whatever name it is you're using on the box. Because again first class mail has to go somewhere and someone paid for that to get delivered and before they send it back as "unknown" they don't want to presume someone had a visitor who needed something delivered during their short stay.Just put the name on the box if that is a requirement at your dwelling.

    I probably will just use mine or my fiance's name (he gets his mail here). Although, we do still get all of my grandfathers mail (expect the paper- he was the only one who read it) because my mom is in charge of his estate and was his financial and medical power of attorney.  We still get his bank statements, medical bills, magazines, etc.  It would be nothing like using a previous resident's name (especially since my grandparents and my mom, aunt, uncle, and I are the only ones who have ever lived here) since all of his mail is still sent here to my mom.  The only thing is that he never really received packages even when he was alive and the mail folk that deliver here have been the same people for as long as i can remember.  They know he is deceased but they also know that my mom is supposed to receive mail for him.  Still, I think it would the mail folk would find it rather odd for a dead man to receive a package (i think someone mentioned this).  All in all, I agree that it would probably be best to use the name of someone who is living AND actually receives mail here.  Thanks guys!!

    Don't know what country you live in, but if your mailman can do all that he deserves to be making at least 100k and a gold medal. Over here they just send mail to the addressee unless told otherwise...
