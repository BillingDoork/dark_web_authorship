    Time and time again I see people asking questions such as, is it safe to order X amount of substance from [Random Country] to [Random Country] etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This comes down to one ultimate truth, it is totally dependent on your vendor and his/her shipping methods. Me personally, I do not even think of ordering from a vendor without actively discussing their shipping methods, seizure rates, signature policies, refund policies, etc. This is how I have maintained a near 7 digit transaction history over a 2-year period without any refunds, CD's, or anything of that nature. All in all, I have never shipped anywhere other than a personal address(albiet not in my name, but of someone else). Some of you guys here may think this is foolish, but I assure you if you take pro-active measures in communication with your vendor, you will have no problems. If a vendor is shit at communicating and doesn't answer your questions completely, simply DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM. The risk to your freedom is not worth it. The same goes if you do not have confidence in your vendors packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the USA, Domestic-&gt;Domestic is usually pretty safe, but CD's/Busts of packages are not unheard of. As long as a vendor takes basic precaution most packages will ship without detection. With this said, I still advise you to follow the above advice even with domestic vendors with perfect ratings. While it is good to look at feedback and do research, talk to the vendor yourself and get more information. Do not expect a vendor to be completely revealing of their stealth methods if you have never ordered from them, but most will give you a general idea of what they do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Me personally I have ordered multiple bulk orders from all over the world to the USA, and I have never had a problem because of the above guidelines that I follow. This includes bulk orders from Netherlands, Africa, Canada, Germany, Uk, Columbia/Peru(bulk cocaine) and other remote areas. In my searches for certain overseas products, I usually end up talking to 4-6 vendors before I find one with a shipping method that sounds secure enough that I can put my confidence in. Too many times I hear a vendors shipping methods, especially international, and inspite of their "high success rate" their shipping methods sometimes sound like they rely too much on luck and are not secure/clever enough. TRUST YOUR INSTINCT. If you think there is a fault in the stealth, try to work it out with the vendor, or simply do not do business with them. Do not risk your freedom if you do not have full confidence in their stealth. Even if you do manage to avoid a CD, your address might as well be considered burned and you won't be ordering from SR anytime soon again if you care about your keeping your freedom.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use your own judgement. It often has little to do with Country-&gt;Country but rather what the vendors precautions/methods are. People once told me that it would be 100% impossible to find a bulk-powder connection in South America for cheap and uncut product on SR, but low and behold with enough persistence and precaution I have found a vendor who has successfully sent me multiple LBS of powder without any issues ever. The stealth is just that good. For his stealth/supply limit reasons I cannot disclose the name or the stealth method, please do not ask.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With this said. If you see a vendor you really want to work with for their product, and you don't think their stealth is up to par from what they have told you, do not be afraid to talk to them and suggest better methods. This is how I have linked up with many vendors who's stealth was garbage at first. Having smarter vendors on the road is better for EVERYONE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope this has inspired thought in some individuals. Mod's can sticky this if they like. I will be posting more in the future of various techniques and rules I have followed to stay safe and successful on the road, so look out for them. Knowledge is power!

    That's a pretty good tip, thanks for sharing! I usually talk to vendors before ordering too but honestly most have inconspicuous packages, which is all that matters because if it gets inspected they'll find the stuff whether or not it's hidden. I would discuss stealth when ordering from Columbia though, especially if it's bulk!
