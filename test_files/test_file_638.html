    I was expecting mail today and the postman pulled up to my address marked something on a device with a pen and rode onto the next house. What is this? Should I be concerned?

    I'd guess the package he had for your mail box was too large so he marked it, you will probably get a letter in the mail to go collect from the PO?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Big or small order?

    Never seen this vendor before.

    They have some nice molly from what i can see. Shame about the FE first, seems a few UK vendors are asking for FE early.

    <br/>
    Did you opt for tracking?

    <br/>
    Check your PO, go down there and ask if there is anything for you.

    Yeah i would have thought so...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So you obviously didnt opt for tracking...wonder what he entered in that device of his..?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe they dont carry cards on them, but they must, who else puts them in there. ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you wont go to the PO, wait till tomorrow and see what happens. ;)

    were you waiting for the mailman and watching him threw the window or something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    maybe he was just playing with his samsung galaxy note.

    posties only deliver things that can be put in letterboxes, and that do not require signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    if it was a large package or something that would require a signature, you get the parcel/courier/contractors that do that job.

    Not that im a postman stalker, but I have observed that the postie will stop in front of houses , to sort his post for the next lot of houses.
    <br/>
    Ive seen him do it from under my hedge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive cursed him from the very core of my bone marrow on the occasions hes done it outside mine in fairness though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace.

    Thats not true at all or at least everywhere if something needs to be sign or is to Big.. Iv had many packages to big and my mail man pulls up and leaves it on my porch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Iv had packages that have needed to be sign and she pulls in and knocks on the door and if im home i sign. if not then she leaves a note..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe thats just where u are,cause i have never in my years of order all kinda stuff had a package tht was to big be taking to the post office, Only if im not their to sign for it..
