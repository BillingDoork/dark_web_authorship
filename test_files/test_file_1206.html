    This order will not have tracking. Should I ship the order even though USPS and google maps both say this address does not exist? I already notified the customer and they verified that the address is correct.

    Could it be brand new construction?

    Can you determine which part is invalid?  For example, is it the street name, the zip, the suite #?  I'd be hesitant to ship anything to an address that doesn't exist and/or is not valid simply because I'd worry that the buyer would try to scam you when it inevitably didn't show up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then again, as ng2uDXu4 already mentioned, it could be new construction, though I'd think that doing a "street view" of the area would show whether this was a feasible assumption or not.

    Thank you for trying to help. The customer just figured it out. It was the wrong house number. I am so glad that I decided to check this particular address on the USPS site or this order would have never arrived.

    Glad to hear it worked out! Prior to seeing you had resolved the problem I was going to suggest simply running a google search of each aspect of the address. Verify city and zip code, then move to street and lastly street number. Sometimes google maps can be a little unreliable, believe it or not. Responsible of you to check prior to sending!
