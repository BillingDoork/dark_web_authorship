    A package was supposedly sent over a week ago. Tracking shows that a delivery was attempted at 7:20ish and a note was left (no note was actually left). Domestic USPS Express mail. The item scanned into the post office at 7. I know they tend to play fast and loose with scan times, but it does seem odd. That seems like a really quick time to get to the delivery location. Stealth has been good with this vendor. It's been a week since that supposed delivery. Is this a possible controlled delivery attempt? Should I just show up at the post office with the DCN?

    Edit: I should note, real names were used for the receiving address. It was a small quantity of prescription medicines so I don't think smell would be an issue.

    Or... It could be that you just were one of the first on the delivery route. I doubt it was a controlled delivery, but please keep in mind that prescription medicines that come in form of pills might be detected in x-ray.

    Right that is something I was worried about. The fact that they haven't tried to redeliver or even leave a real notice makes me suspicious. I tried requesting redelivery from an internet cafe using the DCN but still nothing. The next step is calling, but I'm definitely wary of that.

    USPS is your nationalized post office right? At least courier services are sketchy as hell when it comes to tracking info. It's all over the board and they lose packages and just don't give a shit. The data on "note left" might be some standard code on "recipient unavailable" and the delivery guy was probably just too lazy to leave a note. I would probably be paranoid at first, too, but if we are talking about a pretty low amount of prescription drugs my advice would be to calm down and fetch the package at the post office. They wouldn't spent resources on a controlled delivery if the amount of the drugs is merely for personal use. This is the first time your are ordering from SR? Not trying to dis you, welcome if you are.

    Yeah I'm just give them a call, maybe from a prepaid cell to see what is going on. This is my like 25th order over the course of 4-5 months, and they were all Priority mail which came on time. This is the first really delayed one which made me paranoid, especially since it's express which is supposed to be faster. USPS is the national mail carrier service here.

    Alright, you are more familiar with the black market then... Anyway, sometimes post offices just fuck up. If you have a prepaid cell phone just give them a call.
