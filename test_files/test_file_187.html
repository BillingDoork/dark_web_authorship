    It seems the new CAPTCHA is working to keep the spam posts down. Why that wasn't done two months ago I do not know. I don't understand why the user has not been banned and mention of their website isn't blocked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets just hope the CAPTCHA continues to work, otherwise the forum could go down hill fast since the moderators don't seem to be able to quickly react to issues.

    we could make a little organized 'SR defence-force' of sorts for things like this=P with chanse to quickly retaliate and deter further abuse of this community if we can show any threat is struck down fast and hard every time
    <br/>
    with enough dedicated and prepared participants, even things like LOIC or w/e its called could be of help, with enough people there could be responsetime 24/7 to knock down any such simple threats like websites, even for people who know very little about other stuff LOIC could be an easy but effective measure. Would need organization and participation from many though. Or just a single http-request flooder- type thing with a fat list of public proxies may be enough to cripple the webserver..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ive already messaged their isp, registrar, every related abuse dept. etc., aswell as reporting their site as fraudulent,spam-based and possibly malware to a multitude of sites, including Google &amp; FBI, but theyre still up so I guess that wasn't much help,atleast not yet..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    did quick look for simple security holes directly on their site, but no easy obvious ones to me atleast. just had a quick look tho, I dont feel like spending much time on this, as a simple forum feature on our side could completely fix this! But maybe still potential with deeper digging? Just noticed the captcha, maybe that's all there was needed and this is already fixed!=) Theres a few other domains on their server, nothing special after a quick look though..  like their sister site (bitcointalks or whatever it was named.. it was on a different (big, shared-hosting I believe-) server, BTW I reported that too and got response from ISP (one in the US) that the host had been notified and was told the issues were fixed, and noticed shortly after the domain was suspended-- not sure if related to my reports though.)-- looks like that sister-site and server is very similar- theres a bunch of forum sites on both servers hosting this btkoin and the other site using the same forum-software, all chinese ones.., several of which had malware-javascript with drive-by download of viriis that can be used against them to shut em down. so Id guess they are managing their own servers for this atleast in part, or maybe just using different servers from the same shared hosting company where lots of chinese use the same chinese sofware..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the other (bitkointalks..whatever) server, many more sites were hosted, and some apparently vulnerable to different vulnerabilities.. try put a ' in the url like here http://www.jyhkjd.com/product/html/?1'6.html (dont think itll appear in this standard FF tor-browser though) and it gives a script-error revealing controlpanel software (cpanel) and the hosting account's username, and more interestingly an sql query error with the input ', so it seems some sql-query injection is possible..Im just not sure how to fully exploit it myself, just tried a lil once with sqlmap with limited success.. But definitely seems very much vulnerable, and many of the sites on the server. With this it might be possible to gain filesystem access thru logins in the database or such, and further maybe access to their hosting account, dump their databases with logins, get personal info on perpetrators we can get deeper with etc.-- if someone with more knowledge of sqli and the time/motivation to look further could look into that it could be nice=P
    <br/>
    I guess we shouldn't talk too much about such things here tho, as they adapt their spam according to changes etc. here it seems they are following
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also I may be able to contribute in some ways like DoS, Ive got loads of gbit boxes all over the planet I Could waste.., and many other ways Im sure could be used to keep them out of business, but again all this requires some work and would take some resources Id rather not just throw away either.. would be nice if it was organized more, like other's starting another DDoS when/if they recover after first one. But I guess everyone thinks the same and don't wanna be the only ones wasting time for this fairly thankless task for something that should be Very easy to fix with a little addon to the forum here or something!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    many other ways, we can clog their communications by auto-spamming them in every way (email,live support, fake orders, etc...), keep reporting them as fraud etc.,  and also commit fraud against their site. I'm pretty sure that with a little fraud or planning, their Paypal is very easy to take out of action. Their cc-processing gateways will eventually be taken down after repeated fraud, (especcially if it appear as they themselves are trying to scam their payment processors with stolen ccs or such) and they can no longer accept payments, or atleast give them big fraud-fees and possibly bigger trouble. I havent even checked what payment processors they use (if any-) except PP tho, but this all shouldnt be very hard. Or if we could find info on host policies we may do strategic DoS to bump their bandwidth fees unavoidably high without completely taking them down, or something like that..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    there's loads and loads of such fairly easy things that I think can be done if we find no other way to penetrate thru software or network. If there's no other way Id be willing to help a little atleast, if no change is ever done thru this forum to fix it....   but I wouldnt wanna be alone just wasting my time &amp; resources either, and Im really just a stupid n00b to much of this with limited time, motivation and resources alone.. This doesn't really bother me personally all that much either tbh..  and surely things like this'll happen again in another way later unless better fixes are found on our side.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In any way Im sure we'll face many attacks of different kinds as SR stays alive. Maybe SR will even face bigger troubles from more powerful adversaries some time, it would prolly be good to have some less-known gathering points (maybe big public forums using internal codes or such to communicate &amp; organize) if something happened, and have prepared a group who can return fire who are motivated with clear simple goals, before we become victim of a serious attack that may prevent our communication/organization. we'd be much weaker and less motivated if suddenly scattered all over with no contact..
    <br/>
    may be useful in many scenarios not just things like this to be more prepared for whatever threat anyway!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway, just a few thoughts and suggestions..^^
    <br/>
    I may be able to chip in with some time &amp; resources but wouldn't wanna go on alone, and Im really just a stupid newb to most of this.. And it seems other easy measures from our side could be implemented instead to stop this stupid spam. But maybe this new (?) captcha was all there was needed and this isn't a problem anymore now.. hopefully.
    <br/>

    When SR has such an easy solution to a potentially lethal to the SR site issue and SR fails to implement that solution, there is most certainly a reason.  Is the SR management stupid?  Are they lazy?  Are they absentee site owners?  I believe all these possible reasons can be dismissed as obviously not the case.  The only reason that seems to make sense is that SR has a vested interest or an economic payback for not attending to the issue.  Or they have a formal policy of laissez faire in regards to the economic safety of the SR membership that loyally supports their site.  I am dismayed that no simple solution has effected.  Also quite disappointed.  We put our trust and our future freedom in the hands of SR.  A short post stating "ATTENTION - NO BUSINESS WITH THIS OUTFIT" would make everything right from my perspective.  What thinks the masses?

    You really sound crazy. No, they aren't stupid, or lazy, or derelict. DPR is, no exaggeration, risking his life. The real reason this issue hasn't been dealt with before is just that it's such low priority. The btkoin spam is an annoying mosquito, that's all.

    No we don't. We use PGP. The whole thing is set up so that we *don't* have to trust DPR or SR. Which, actually, is the main reason I do sort of trust them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Reread what you wrote and ask yourself whether you would say any of that stuff in person. Really! Try to have some perspective.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, the problem with spam like this is that we don't even know for sure where it originates. So "retaliating" against btkoin.com doesn't even make sense. Let's not be an angry mob.

    They always register a throwaway user. It probably takes just seconds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If "btkoin.com" got banned, next time they'd say "btkoin dot com" or use Cyrillic characters that look like the normal characters, or whatever. There are an infinite number of permutations. Eventually the banwords would start affecting normal posts that have nothing to do with the spam.

    I certainly don't think this is the case either. Your first idea: It would be a horrendous business decision to partner up with a scammer attacking your own community. That idea was completely absurd. Second idea: Again, another horrendous business decision. People feeling less safe = less transactions = less money for SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ***The problem is that the staff is completely swamped with all manner of problems right now. They don't have enough manpower to fix these issues in a timely manner. Don't you think it's just a little difficult to find 100% trustworthy people to help manage a multi-million dollar black market, on the internet?***
