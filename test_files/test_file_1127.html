    Ahahahaha I love your persistence man. I cracked up thinking about some pissed off guy from Silk Road yelling into the phone at customs every single day over a seized order. Most people run around in fright like a headless chicken when they get a seizure letter, but you just get worked into a blind rage at the thought of some customs officers kid running around laughing in your replica Air Yeezy's and decide to give those bastards a piece of your mind.

    Bro, why are you worried about receiving a replica watch? These type of things typically breeze through customs unless you have a huge order of them. Think about it, a watch goes through customs, it could be any watch, why waste their time over 1 potentially counterfiet watch when they have thousands of drugs packages to sort through? I'd be more worried about the methylone, but even then they have to test it, there are so many powders comming from china every day some not even the slightest hazardous/illegal.

     Bro, why are you worried about receiving a replica watch? These type of things typically breeze through customs unless you have a huge order of them. Think about it, a watch goes through customs, it could be any watch, why waste their time over 1 potentially counterfiet watch when they have thousands of drugs packages to sort through? I'd be more worried about the methylone, but even then they have to test it, there are so many powders comming from china every day some not even the slightest hazardous/illegal.

    Because I have the best customer service out of every vendor.  I spend 18 hours a day doing customer service on days when I am not on packaging duty.  I usually ship orders within 24 hours of being placed on Sunday through Thursday.  I give out tracking numbers two days after I ship an order if the customer asks me for it (for safety).  Poor Venport had to wait over four months for an order from Gonzo and never received the whole order.  If you go look at his review thread then you will see that people are waiting several weeks on order and have been promised tracking numbers for weeks now.  Many of his customers are tired of waiting and currently in resolution.  It is obvious why he said there is no room for comparison comparing my customer service to Gonzo or any other vendor on Silk Road.
