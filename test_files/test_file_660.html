    I had my methods of being totally descreet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Buy stamps at diff post office, get delivery confirmation etc and drop em in the drop off mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now this is impossible. You will have to go personally to the post office clerk to scan your package to put the label on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Looks like stamps will no longer work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want tracking, you must go to the counter to receive it on your receipt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any vendors care to share their solutions?

    Post Offices still do exist that have no video surveillance (at least for now), but it can be a daunting process to find them, or you live in a small city that has too few post offices, and they all have video surveillance. You can now buy prepaid flat rate envelopes with an "online account" but they'll still be delivered. Or you can buy your postage through the APC with a prepaid credit card, or just disguise your identity using the techniques I reveal in my stealth guide. Personally, I have no beef with going up to the clerk, but that's because I trust my level of stealth and my disguise techniques. I've never had a package fail me. 100% delivery rate.

    i have no problem to do that either, but all it takes is one package and your face plastered all over the surveillance. I'd like to improve my security measures and not defer from them. Seems like a prepaid card is the way to go right now. I can't believe this isn't a bigger issue right now. It's a big blow to domestic mail with tracking.

    Yep, like I said in the other thread, perhaps DPR or SR staff needs to send out a mass message to all vendors alerting them of the stamps issue so that they don't miss it and accidentally loose a whole bunch of packages? I'm yet unsure if they'd actually scan the now-defunct lime green labels. I was just speculating, or, more accurately, daydreaming out loud. I could be completely wrong though, so I suggest not trying it on a live shipment!

    "Buyer agrees that shipping risk is on them and we will not refund or reship for free..

    ^ is what i'm putting on my page. unfortunately the time has come were DCN (now called usps tracking) has came to an end and has fucked up the escrow process. I'm making everyone FE that wants to by from me. As if they dont FE i cant prove i sent the pack and they could reverse scam. Sucks but this is what it has come to. Messing with prepaid cards and going into POs is what LEO is trying to make drug senders do. I will not. I'll pay for the postage, and drop into the blue box without tracking. I predict a LOT of people ignoring and taking risks and a lot of people going down in the future.

    I knew stamps were going up, I had no idea they were changing the way packages were sent.       Not a good thing for anyone.      I hope this is just a small bump in the road.

    Well, remember that USPS clerks have been just as in the dark as we've been about the new changes. They're just grunt workers and most of them probably could care less about the fact that illicit substances are mailed daily. They're just paid a small wage to handle the packages, and as long as they're not harmed in the process, they'll keep on doing things the way they're used to until they get yelled at for "doing it wrong" so as I had speculated, it's likely that they may still scan the lime green DCN labels for a while yet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just realize that not all packages may get scanned, or that one or all might potentially be returned to sender at any moment. So there's still going to be a level of risk involved if you opt to continue using the green labels. If you choose to do so, I'd recommend using a different return address on each package you send, so they don't get the idea to take a whole bunch of packages with the same return address and personally return them to the house to explain the new policy to some unsuspecting owner. More variety of return addresses == bigger PITA to return them all... Just a thought!

    BlueViking, I will start to do shipment experiments to myself to see what flies and what doesn't. Will you do the same and post about it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Course, any results could just be temporary because as hypervelocity says, they could just do things as accustomed for a while and then tighten up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts?

    Apparently the USPS does have white tracking slips and things will be going back to normal if they are going to give them out. Currently some reports are that they will and some that they won't. It may be they are just short on them (backordered) and they will be freely available later. I think dire claims of "a buyers (or sellers) scamming free for all" are a bit premature at this point. Unless you buy into the belief that there is no other choice.

    This seems like sound advice.  It'd take a small fortune to start though with the prices for new ID pieces virtual offices and purchasing everything else up front as well.  This is of course before the several week long process of actually getting your money once your listing has sold.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once going it wouldn't be unbearable to maintain though. :)

     As a biz customer can then order prepaid boxes galore and envelopes to your virtual office or po box, use it for a month then switch to a new business account and totally new identity.

    comsec, I think I understand what you're saying, except for the part after "you sign up...". Seriously, though, what is a virtual office, and what are virtual visa numbers, not to mention "interweb".

    As i said in the other thread, i sent out a first class package with stamps dropped in blue box and the green dcn works perfectly. I sent it 1-31-13. I think they will continue to work since not all post offices have the new white ones which will replace them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Come on now, if they were going to toss into the garbage all packages sent the old way, don't you think they would be advertizing this all over the place? People would be mad as hell if the necktie they sent to dad got trashed because some rule nazi didn't like the dcn or the stamps on it.

    Far as i can tell everything is the same as before except you get free tracking with priority.

    ^ Sunny1 - I did the EXACT same thing. I sent on the 28th of January to my friend on the east coast going to school - I live in the Western USA, Anyways at first I though everything was cool. It started to track my package until about half way then I just stopped getting updates! Turns out 5 days later my package arrives with the green label still attached.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Looks like it's either a win or lose situation as far as I can tell. I mean hell it's all fucked! THIS WHOLE USPS SITUATION IS FUCKING US SELLERS. IT'S SCAM GALORE FOR THE FUCKING BUYERS!

    The new 400 white tracking labels are to be ordered by interested parties online, UNLESS you find a friendly and helpful postal employee who will give you some or even a whole roll over the counter, "anonymously". Needless to say, ordering the labels online kills your anonymity right there, cause the labels can be linked by their tracking numbers directly to you and your address. Unless you figure out a way to have them sent to some hidden drop location that can't be linked to you.

    This is very bad.

    I am reposting this in various tracking label threads in case it is true - sorry to be repetitive.-
    <br/>
    I was told recently that the Free tracking on priority mail is only if you buy the postage online or take the package to the counter. She claimed that even if you have the "400 labels" you have to pay $0.90 more postage for tracking if you drop in a blue box with stamps. I'm not even sure she was saying you could add the extra postage as stamps? I don't trust this information although she seemed to think she was an expert on the subject. She gave me a bunch of different bar code labels she said did not add tracking (even though they say "USPS Tracking #" in bold print) but would keep the package moving through their system faster. These labels are not #400 and do not have the little extra strip on the bottom with a copy of the tracking number to keep.
