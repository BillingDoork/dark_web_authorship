    Maybe the mail is just moving along slowly. Or the vendors claimed your order shipped before even shipping it. Shipments may definitely take over a week (I personally just had to wait a week for a *simple letter* from somebody who's only a 4 hour drive away from here), so it's a little too soon to start worrying too much.

    It's pretty common for delivery's to be delayed when there's a holiday weekend involved.  Express orders with tracking can take twice the normal time and regular first class mail even longer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm in Canada and whenever there is a long weekend involved it seems to take 3-4 days longer for express orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's one of the reasons I always order express with tracking, that way at least I can see where it is and get some idea of when it might arrive.

    Your message gives me some kind of hope. It has 13 business days, but I hope the delay is due to Easter.
