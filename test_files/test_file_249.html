    HUGE piece of advice, I have just now, from this morning, had the police at my house and received a caution. Now I was lucky, the officer in charge had his head screwed on right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My package got stopped by customs and they contacted my local police, etc, it was from Canada to the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, I would have got away with it, totally fine, because I used a false name and denied any knowledge of the package or name. They went away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What went WRONG was that I have a relative living with me, who unfortunately has a Cannabis related record from earlier in the year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They came back within half an hour (after checking names of people living here, which again, was a MISTAKE, do NOT give names of anyone else living at your address if you suspect they have a record), unfortunately this was someone else telling them the names, not my own mistake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They basically came back and started to arrest my nephew, which of course I couldn't let happen. But as mentioned I only got a caution, and the officer was very level headed and we both knew he was only doing his job (they left my bong and vaporizer for me and my medicine that was in my glass already cut up, so I had that waiting for me when I got home :).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So - you CAN deny knowledge, this will work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF you have someone living at your address with a previous cannabis charges, and they find the name and relate it to your address, they WILL be back.

    I find it really strange that you had the police turn up at your house for weed that was sent from Canada.  Are you in Ireland by any chance?  I have had stuff sent from Canada for many years and sometimes it's been seized by customs.  The largest seizure was 56g, but even for that no police ever turned up at my door although at the time I was nervous they might.  In the end I just lost a lot of money because I paid for the weed in advance.  Was it a really massive amount like a quarter pound or something?  It worries me slightly that maybe UK customs/police are taking a tougher stance on these things now if this happened to you in England.  Some of my friends in Ireland have had police turn up at their door before over customs seizures though so over there it's nothing new.  Indeed if police ever do show up just deny any knowledge of the package and act like you know nothing about it.

    In these instances, I am assuming they will have no right to enter the premises as no judge would grant a warrant over small amounts of weed.  In which case deny.

    I got arrested, but got de-arrested (and just getting a caution now), but you CAN get clean off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The mistakes I made, no ones mentioned them anywhere that I've found, and I'm making note of them, and will learn what went wrong through customs.
    <br/>
    (p.s. I suspect the recent Daily Mail article about the Silk Road has something to do with it).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I made a fuller post about it an above thread 'Safe to Order again?' - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91042.0
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've posted some points there, but it's late, and been a busy day, arrested, de-arrested, customs stole half my oz, and worked 8hr shift at sodding LIAM LAYOR (yes, its a piss easy anagram).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, the issue is not a problem at all, it's an excellent opportunity to learn ;)

    +1 karma to you buddy for sharing your story with us, pretty interesting.  How irritating that the customs officers stole half of your ounce but still tried to screw you over for it!  I think I had the same thing happen once with a very reliable source I use, except that time I suspect the customs officers just took the whole ounce and didn't bother sending a letter.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are corrupt people working for customs who are re-selling as well as using drugs which they pocket for themselves while on duty.

    Hey guys,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i am in same boat as TheFireSwamp. expecting 1oz from canada to UK. starting to get a bit worried after reading stories of visits from LE. Obviously will deny if this happens but I did not use a fake name -.- so will just denying it still have the same effect?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any comments would be great.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks

    Yeah you will still be fine. You say someone must have used my name, maybe a neighbour, etc.
    <br/>
    Say you had someone living with you, they were renting a room, etc. They no longer live here now but they must have used my name, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the end, you know nothing. Like other members have mentioned...clean your house before an overseas drop.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the end you deny everything...what can they do? You'll be right mate, we are all in the same boat. ;)

    I've had a very interesting experience with it all, did get a caution at the end of it, but not fussed, seeing as it was 1 oz and could've been a lot worse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know it's been said a few times - DENIAL
    <br/>
    If they try arresting you for 'suspicion' - DENIAL
    <br/>
    If you have a housemate with a past cannabis related offence, and they try arresting that person, make sure she/he understands - DENIAL
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the UK they simply can not do anything. Tbh, I am 99.9% certain (from specialist knowledge) that the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) would not even bring the case to court. As the evidence is circumstancial, it's just your address to someone you don't know, with very likely a lot postal workers fingerprints all over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know what I posted about my own situation, but please do NOT follow my example, as you could say I 'talked' my way out of it (and possibly made some coverts in the process ;). I've known way too many people to get locked up, receive fines, and have a criminal record that will fuck up their life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF you do use a Solicitor - DENIAL !!!
    <br/>
    Do NOT admit anything that will implicate you to your Solicitor. Some are totally fine, I've known a fair few that are tokers, and/or take more. But sometimes they wake up on the wrong side on bed, or that they're being harrassed at work for better performance, or maybe they're just moronic idiots and don't realise the global destruction the War on Drugs have had.
