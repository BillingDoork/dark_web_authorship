    Is it not possible that the vendor is just lazy and has already shipped the product? Even though they really shouldn't be doing this.

    thanks , i just msgd him saying i dont want it shipped and i told him he has been a nightmare to deal with. At least have the decency to reply to my msgs gosh. Anyway If he puts it as in transit now can I still cancel it? I told him to cancel but he mighth come back with "sorry it was shipped days ago but i forgot to put it in transit" even though it is  prob a lie.

    I think this isnt allowed after you printed the label for sending you need to delete the addres and have it confirmed as shipped.
    <br/>
    I self accept all orders on sunday because i dont work to much in the weekend and dont want to have labels with addresses laying arround.

    after 4days you can cancel the order so you will get your btc back..
    <br/>
    If he accepts the order you can go in to reso and ask 100%refund
    <br/>
    maybe you can ask SR support to cancel the order because he doenst answer
    <br/>
    your messages.
    <br/>
    But thus will take a day also i think
    <br/>
    Try contacting the vendor with subject cancel order
    <br/>

    goochihuh,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendors have 4 days in which to process an order, after which you are able to cancel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That means that any number of days up to the 4th day is considered 'acceptable' by SR. Given that, I don't think that your complaint is reasonable.

    Hell dude, ever heard of being patient before? reporting a vendor for not shipping in the time you expect is just plain bs....
    <br/>
    Then threaten to name and shame him? by that statement right there looks like you just name and shamed yourself for being a impatient cunt and expecting to much from vendors, he has done nothing thats against sr rules so your little report will go nowhere well except maybe on your buyer profile for when sr decides resolutions...
    <br/>
    If a vendor doesnt get my order out within the time allowed before the customer can cancel(4 days) i just cancel as soon as possible and go elsewhere.

    SR gives vendors 4 days to process an order. When you put your pin number in and make the purchase, it is a done deal. You do have the option of canceling the order if the vendor does not ship in a 'timely' manner. 'Timely' is considered up to 4 days. After that an option to cancel the order appears.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    None of this has anything to do with a vendor not answering your messages.
