    So about 22+ days ago I FE'd an order. N00b mistake I know, but it was a trusted vendor so I thought it would be cool. I'm still not sure if I want to call it a scam yet, but either way it isn't here. Other orders have gotten to me very quick (like in about 2-3) days, and by reading the vendor's feedback, it looks like most people got theirs in that amount of time too. Not me I guess. The vendor cooperated somewhat, checking the DCN and telling me it was on its way that week (but that was 13 days ago..). I tried messaging him again, but he hasn't responded. If it was a scam, it's not too big of a deal, I guess. It's possible that maybe he didn't actually ship out until long after I FE'd, combined with slow USPS. But either way, I'm now wondering if I should be worried about shipping to this same address? It was only for about 4g of weed, so I'm not worried about a controlled delivery. And if it was seized, do you think I would have gotten a love letter by now? I have the option to ship to a friend if I don't feel comfortable using the same address, but I feel bad about putting her out and it's a bit more convenient to use my current address. I just wanted to hear what you guys think before I put in anymore orders. Thanks.

    You mention usually receiving in 2-3 days which is domestic shipping time but then you mention love letters which points to international shipping? So was this international or domestic?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it's international, you won't always get a love letter...they don't send those out as much as they used to. I don't see why your address still wouldn't be safe to use, like you said it's only about 4 grams of weed and chances are the vendor either didn't ship it or it was just lost.

    Hey man, thanks for the reply. Yeah, it is domestic US shipping. I did some digging on here, and it seemed that sometimes you could get a lover letter even with domestic shipping... Like if they find your shit, but it's clearly personal use amount and they don't want to waste resources for a controlled delivery, they might seize it and send you a letter. I think this has happened to at least a couple people on here, but who knows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But anyway, yeah, that's what I figured. Realistically, I know it will probably never come because, like you said, it's either lost or never sent. I guess it's just that I'd feel better shipping to this address if it would just arrive already, so I could know it was just a fluke. Especially because I plan on placing some bigger bulk orders. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to get over it. Thanks.
