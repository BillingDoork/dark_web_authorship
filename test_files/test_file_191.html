    Hi gang!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a little question, a package arrived that had been open by uk customs, with royal mail stamped on it,etc.Without giving away vendor or packaging,etc the item had been slashed with a knife, inspected then resealed. It contained E and it was visible by looks of things. Why has it been resealed and delivered correctly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone have experiences.

    ahaha, probably officers in UK try all the stuff coming from abroad to check if it's clean and apropriate for true sons of england.

    To be serious, you'd better shit bricks and get rid of the goods ASAP.

    Had a package(envelope) of 4FMA arrive last week from Sweden. It looked liked it had been caught in something ... maybe franking machine, dunno, but had cut through like 10 layers of paper - delivered in Royal Mail plastic pocket powder allover the show!! Makes you wonder - did they think it was talcum powder!! Can't believe it was still delivered!

    It's not there anymore lets put it that way (just say it's been binned). Just a very strange one? Pills are unusual shape, any chance they thought it was maybe steroids or something similar?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think with UK they only give a fuck if it's getting tax on it or not. Jesus the story above is crazy lol! Maybe they used mecke test or similar to determine contents of package from Sweden.

    Received some a package in exactly the same type of bag/circumstances.....It's either one of two options
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) LE are allowing packages to go to buyers in hope of bigger busts/more intel etc from the 1st package sent to your address (1st package they find, think of it as 'pre-flagging' addresses).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) The delivery service actual postmen are so good/bad they post anything without a care in the world.

    or they already building a case against you and hoping that more packages will arrive to confirm that you're ordering drugs yourself and didn't received by mistake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what in my 3rd world shithole country they delivered 4kg of cocaine and let to keep it for a couple of days to track down where it was going then arrested everyone who was involved with it.

    I wouldn't lose to much sleep over this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would suggest it was inspected and deemed 'not suspicious' by Customs/Royal Mail (strange to believe I know).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would change your address on all new orders from now though, and limit the quantity of contraband in your home for a while.

    Maybe you just got lucky and the customs guy who checked it figured it wasn't even worth bothering with and decided to be cool.

    well yeah,, but to open a package you need to get a warrant. so police found some powder and opened it and resealed ? I'm telling you they probably building a case or will be watching that address right now.

    I think if they knew what is was and let it be delivered, you would never know they opened it....My dad has been working for USPS for 29 years, first 22 years processing mail, the remaining years working the express room. I won't let a vendor send me anything express mail. Express gets a lot more hands on and personal when its being processed. My father use to come home and tell me about the drug packs that have been coming through and how he has to work with the postal inspectors on numerous occasions. He said sometimes they slowly build cases by letting some packs go through but still documenting everything that's inside. All the time re-sealing the pack back up and you would never know it was ever opened in the first place. Once they feel they have a big enough case, here comes the controlled delivery.....Just some insight from what I learned by my dads stories

    The way I see it you have 3 possibilities
    <br/>
    1) The person saw it and didn't know what it was. Maybe thought it was some sort of medicine and repackaged it (stupid postman)
    <br/>
    2) The person saw it and knew what it is but didn't give a fuck and repackaged it (cool postman)
    <br/>
    3) The person saw it and sent it after informing the LE (asshole postman)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way it's probably best you get a new address to send to
