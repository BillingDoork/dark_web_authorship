    Hey guys, had an incident where cash sent via USPS express mail was seized (domestic). The reason I know is because I called around wondering what happened to the mail. While searching for the location of the mail, the postal employees asked about the contents and I didn't tell them that it had that much cash inside..  I had used my name/previous address and the recipients name/adress so I'm wondering if the Feds will actually do something about it. I was told by friends that usually they just seize it and nothing happens afterwards. I have cleaned my place out and taken all the necessary steps to protect myself. If there is anyone who has prior experience with this kind of situations and could help me by sending a PM, I would greatly appreciate it.

    Never happened to me, but curious how much we are talking about.  It is not illegal to send cash in the mail, but if it is a large amount the pigs will steal it and make you prove it came from legal means same as them pulling a duffel bag with $30K out of your trunk.  They have to give you a seizure slip of some sort though I believe.  They can't just jack your cash and not give you a receipt and opportunity to reclaim the money you have been saving since your first lemonade stand. :)

    It IS against USPS regulations to send cash via priority mail (not sure about express mail). I got an effing International Money Order seized (cash and USPS Money orders have metallic bands that are easy to detect) back during a dalliance with Pot by Post before the Silk Road existed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was able to reclaim the money after a number of months. I mean I was just sending a money order to a PO Box in Vancouver... but it says on the Priority envelope not to send cash or cash instruments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sending cash by First Class mail is allowed.

    Thanks for the replies guys,..  so was not telling the truth about the contents of the mail to the USPS employees over the phone a bad idea? i didn't want to tell USPS workers how much was in it because i was fearful they might just steal it if i told them the amount. it was not over 10k.

    I ship money on a regular basis via express mail never had to claim it under $2500.They require a declaration of contents form for any amount between 2,501-10,000 in which they will make you count the money in front of them but they still wont ask for your id.. once i was sending 3000 the postal employees told me not to waste my time with the form. Its not illegal to ship money, it may appear as money laundering if you do not make sure its declared... and for larger then 10,000 it must be sent via certified mail, in which regular postal workers do not get to handle the package at all..( dont know if you know this, but behind those walls is basically a mexican slave labor camp, operating the sorting machines and where they actually have people physically sorting mail, for po box'es and carrying the mail to the trucks but they are not allowed to touch certified mail at all)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and shipping cash via first class or priority is legal too, as long as its under $400.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    contact them, prove you have a means to have that much cash, and come up with a good reason you were sending that much cash, tell them loan payback from a bad gambling habit you used to have.and it will take a while but they will give your money back.

    This is FALSE.

    Domestically. Money. Will. Get. Seized. But instead it will be in front of you at your address with badges.

    if the cash smells like mj, would it be harder to claim it? also, i used my old address so if they ever send a notice to let me come claim the money, i don't know if i would be able to receive it since i no longer reside at the old address. what then?

    What I have heard (and I don't have a verified source for this) is that often when cash is seized you'll get a letter from the PO saying that they seized cash and you can have it if you can prove it is yours. If you can't prove it, no cash.

    Prove its yours by means of obtaining. meaning if you withdrew a lot from your bank right before hand, get your bank statement. prove you have a job and you were obtaining money. You job has to be able to provide the amount of money you sent within 1 year. so say you sent 30k, and you only make 10k a year your fucked)

    If the feds (or more specifically postal inspectors) seized your money you and the recipient would get a love letter. I had them show up at my door with a box that was overnighted to me containing around 10k. I was charged with money laundering but nothing came of it due to the fact that I have legitimate funds in my accounts well over that amount. .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The letter i received said that the package was seized because it was thought to contain drugs, which might have been because it was packaged around such and a dog hinted on it (they also came to my house with a dog, but had no warrant to search inside, which my lawyer pointed out was a strange misstep on their part).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They also sent letters to every person to live at both addresses within the last 5 years or so, The letters also mention how to contest the seizure, which in the end turned out to be a lot more trouble then it would have been worth considering lawyer costs and the potential heat it could draw on both parties.

    so fucking weird man. i saw you post this a few days ago and this is EXACTLY what happened to me a very short amount of time ago. luckily, i used a random return addy so it's not traceable to me... but fuck me i lost a lot of money. from what i found out from asking around, the feds are just going to seize the money and send the love letter saying show up to court and prove it's legit money or you're not getting it back. so basically just chalk it up as a loss because it's definitely not worth the trouble. if it was a decent amount of cash you should worry about being investigated as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    future reference: vacuum seal your money! large percentage of us currency is contaminated with drugs. dogs can smell it. and don't keep your money where you drugs are... i learned this shit the hard way
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also, i got to thinking about this the other day: what if the address you were sending to is red flagged? as soon as it got scanned at the PO they would already be interested in seeing what's going on with your pack.... Postal inspector might have bullshitted his way into getting a warrant for the package. they're good at training dogs to alert via a minute body gesture... this is a long shot but you know damn well it could happen

    They would have to be some sort of x-ray or dogs to pick up on the money inside.  I remember someone having a post earlier about seeing dogs that were used to find money being shipped usps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know it isn't usually good to use ups or fed-ex...but maybe they would be better in the case of sending cash.   Damn I would had to lose out on 10k.
