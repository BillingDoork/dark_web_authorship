    Hey everyone.  I made an order for MDMA and it is out for delivery.  I noticed odd behavior with the tracking number.  Basically the status stayed at "Origin post is preparing shipment" for 7 days and then today it updated with Arrival at Unit in my hometown.  It completely skipped the INBOUND ISC CUSTOMS, OUTBOUND ISC CUSTOMS, and SORTING COMPLETE.  Usually my euro packs go thrugh NY ISC and I am able to see it as it moves through customs.  I would just like to know if this is normal behavior and just a USPS issue with the item not being scanned during the process.  If someone else has had this type of behavior as well and had no issues receiving shipment it would be of great help.  Luckily I have a ton of legitimate computer parts that are shipped to this address as well.  It is not my home.  I think it is good to have a lot of normal packs shipped to a location your drop. Any input would be appreciated.

    I had a euro origin package over the holidays make the first two scans in the origin country, stating it was being forwarded to the US, then just a final delivery scan. I also waited about 40 days in between scans for that package. Tracking works sporadically at best.

    Don't rely on tracking for accurate and up to date info;  i've seen no updates on tracked mail, up until delivery and suddenly all the prior checkpoints were logged. It's a very spotty service IMO

    most likely.......its fine. exact same thing happened to me last week. It said inbound ISC after taking longer than normal to clear outbound sorting / etc and get to ISC. Never did the whole customs thing. Just made it to me in record time. Have you ordered multiple times from this vendor? may I inquire if it's a rc?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Based off my pretty extensive research regarding tracking, I don't think it's a big deal.
