    Alright, I've been looking at domestic order in where to buy some bulk mdma but, the price seems to be a tad higher then what I was expecting. I've also never tried to order from an international vendor before, I was just wondering if buying an ounce was worth the risk to get it much cheaper, or to pay the premium and buy it domestically.

    some NL vendors drive their packages to Germany or Belgium because they're close, but not as suspicious.

    You might look there for better prices.

    I have gotten orders from the Netherlands but I have also had allot of trouble. Had some stuff get lost in customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am a buyer from the USA and if it does come it takes several weeks but the quality is FIRE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are in the EU, Dutch is a good option though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    North American vendors are just reselling the Dutch  product and you are paying for the shipping time. I will also point out customs knows that allot of drugs come from Holland so you risk extra screening for your package. This is why many vendors launder the shipment through Germany, that country does not have a bad reputation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't know where you are Phave, but if you are in North America I would recommend the vendor CanadianForeger.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    His prices are about what the Dutch guys are ($30 a gram for MDMA) He only ships to America and Canada though,. His stealth is good and right now he has both brown and white MDMA both available in bulk.

    The only package that i've had come up missing came from the netherlands...but I suspect that it may not have been sent.

    Thanks, yea I'd be ordering from the USA. I was mostly looking into Old Amsterdam, which looking through all of his feedback appears to either have reshipped or refunded any package which got caught at customs. Plus, all of his reviews appeared to be threw the roof.

    CanadianForger is known for stealth. And he isn't reselling dutch stuff, brown sand is much better quality and purity imo. His refund policies are also among the better ones out there.

    Hello, I have been a long time MDMA buyer on the road for just over a year now  8) I get anything from 100G-500G internationally, I'm located in the USA  ;) Anyways to answer your question, I would definitely order internationally, I have never EVER ordered MDMA domestic off the SR, if you're only looking for 1 ounce I would strongly suggest Interways, I literally just got 200G from him today and it only took 1 week to get to me!! And his stealth is damn good. His product looks EXACTLY like the picture. STAY AWAY from OA! His stealth is fucking garbage, I placed a 250G order with him and only received half of it like 9 months back... I suggest Interways or Dutchtrade because they are the top international vendors at the moment. Dont be scared to order internationally, I strongly recommend it, as long as you use your REAL NAME and your REAL ADDRESS you will be fine, once you start using fake shit that's when a red flag is thrown and your packages gets opened and then homeland security throws a flash-bang into your living room  ::) I have NEVER had a package not show up because I do shit correctly (knock on wood) But please stay away from OA, I heard about a guys door getting kicked in by homeland security ordering from that fucker and it was only over 50G....

    thanks guys, yea I just ordered quite a bit from Instagrams to test things out. But, I'd be looking for more bulk when it comes to this summer since everyone and their mother will be hitting up the festivals around where I live. But, yea I'm mostly just worried about a few things like; shipping times, refund policies/reship, if it gets caught and stuff like that. Mostly because I don't want to be out a few thousand dollars.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone who has tried multiple different vendors, or is there a review thread somewhere on here so I can determine where to buy from?
