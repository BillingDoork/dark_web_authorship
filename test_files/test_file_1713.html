    I'm moving back to University soon, in halls of residence. Have any of you successfully received SR packages at these places? Letters and very small packages go straight to our letter box, unchecked. But larger parcels are held at reception and you need to show ID and a signature to get them. I wont be able to use a fake name for ordering at all. However they do respect privacy and never open packages that might look suspicious, last year, I ordered loads of boxes of Nos and they didn't even bat an eye.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All I intent to order is the odd gram now and then, and maybe tabs from a vendor in my country. Have any of you done this and been safe? I don't know if i want to run the risk of being caught.

    Half the orders on SR go to dorm room addresses, you'll be fine.

    If you're worried about it find someone you trust and have it sent to their place.

    and maybe pay them for taking the risk

    I had around 10 packages sent to me back in my dorm days. So many packages go through dorms that they really just don't care, everything I've gotten has looked like just your regular order from ebay. If you want to be more cautious, just order lsd or anything in letter mail, it's by far the easiest thing to get sent to your dorm. I have gotten both letters and packages that I've had to sign for, and they had no idea that they were handing me a box full of drugs. You should be safe as long as you don't order a fuckin' pound of bud.
