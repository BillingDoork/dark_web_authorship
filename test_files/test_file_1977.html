    I'm getting ready to place my first order on SR, and I had a question I figured you guys could help me with. I plan to order when I get to my University(in the US), and the way mail works there is everyone has one address, and mail is separated by the recipient's name. My question is: Do you think it's too risky to get weed delivered to my school's mail room? I considered renting a PO Box at the local post office, but I think a college age student renting one when there is free mail available at the school would be sketchy, especially since SR is all I would use it for. Advice?

    Why would that be sketchy? If you sign up for one, they know you're expecting mail and packages, which could just be gifts and small little things from home from relatives and friends for all they know. Getting packages isn't suspicious at all. It happens millions of times every single day.

    I'm saying it would be sketchy because there is a mail service provided for students at the school, including packages. I'm afraid they would think I am renting one because I'm receiving something that I wouldn't want to go through the school or something that could get me in trouble.

    Still unsure of you're concern, why would the post office be suspicious? If the post office ask questions say that you have had mail stolen in the past and you no longer trust the uni's mail. I doubt 'they' would be suspicious enough so ask questions about 1 person opening up a single p.o. box. I would just go ahead and open it up.
    <br/>
    Geez people need to learn to lie and make them believable, its actually quite easily, take a simple truth and twist it just enough to suit your circumstances so there is enough truth to the statement so that you seem like you're telling the truth but its a total lie. i.e. someone else in the past may have lost an expected piece of mail in the uni so just pretend that was you and use their experience to warrant your want to get a p.o. box.

    No, that's not even remotely suspicious. You're way too paranoid, just get it sent to the university or a PO box, it doesn't matter which one.

    I think this is overly paranoid.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The post office is offering PO boxes, so why should it be suspicious to open up one? IMHO nobody really gives a fuck, this stuff also pays their paychecks, so why should the stuff be skeptical if somebody uses their services?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you buy a car, you don't have to explain to you car dealer what you will use it for and why exactly your are buying one, he will be happy as it's business for him/her, the only difference might be that you just can't tell them to fuck off and mind their own business as the postal service is kinda a monopoly.
