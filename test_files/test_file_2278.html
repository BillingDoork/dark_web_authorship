    My order left ISC NY( which is customs)this morning and arrived in a city near my citys post office over here in AZ. When I called USPS they said that it was sent to the wrong post office and it being sent back to the main hub and will ship out to my citys post office..they said i should receive it by tomorrow ..if not then friday. they didn't tell me why is was sent to the wrong zip code..they just said they made a mistake.. What do you guys think? Could this be a set-up? Or am I just being paranoid? I ordered 10g of molly.

    I'm in the same boat, kinda.  My 10g order from Pfand isn't gonna make it before EFF, so I'll have to party with that batch once I get home.  But I have more of PF's molly as well as supertrip's shards to enjoy at EFF!

    <br/>
    <br/>
    I saved ALOT and bought from AfterHours
    <br/>
    <br/>
    250 pills for under $850 and they are at 110mg-120mg
    <br/>
    <br/>
    amazing price to product ratio. i was so fucking nervous but i took that chance (when he was below 100 transactions too!) and it was a big success
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    soooo..yeah. solid buy

    first of the shipping speed is rediculous (i send my bulk out in boondocks, a long drive and in the middle of nowhere) and that shit still arrived in 7 days
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the product is great man. nothing like a triforce of some shit, but i like that, because you can safely take one...one a half and roll or double up and roll face
    <br/>
    <br/>
    packaging is LEGIT. nothing SUPER PRO..but nothing anyone can suspect and takes care of the units.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    its too good to pass to be honest
