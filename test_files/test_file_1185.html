    One of the things about getting packages from SR that makes me the most paranoid is using my real name. I don't like giving it to vendors, and I don't like having it on a package of drugs while in the care of the postal service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I got a really good tip from the postal inspector thread and made a fake business to use for deliveries. (dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0 I highly recommend everyone read this) I still get packages sent to my residence, but my name is not on the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For example:
    <br/>
    Guy's Plumbing
    <br/>
    1234 Smokeweedeveryday St
    <br/>
    Anytown, USA 00001
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Setting up a fake business is as easy as getting some legitimate packages shipped to you with that name. You don't have to incorporate or anything. You can just order a bunch of cheap shit, preferably the size of the drug packages you will be receiving. All you are doing is setting a precedent so your mailman doesn't think anything out of the ordinary is going on when the drug packages start arriving. Lots of people have home businesses so this will look very normal. Hell, to make it look that much more legit, you might even want to order a bunch of trade magazines relating the business (ex. - plumbing) under the fake name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This method has worked really well for me. I feel a lot more comfortable knowing that my real name is not on the package or known to the vendor. I highly recommend it to buyers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace

    And if your deliveries goes into a legit business does it give some sort of advantage ? I mean if it;s legit and the address is on commercials  than anyone can send anything and your not responsible for incoming mail .. cause basically not 'fake' or anything like that just 'order that probably "misplaced" into the mail '

    So what happens if a large amount of drugs is intercepted by the postal inspector and he see's that you've received many packages in that same fake business name?  Where is the plausible deniablity?  I don't think there is any...  "No, I don't know anything about that package or who Guy's Plumping is"  "Oh yeah?  You've already received 14 packages addressed to Guy's Plumbing this year."  "Oh uhhh, I don't want to talk without my attorney present."  "Okay dumbass."

    K.I.S.S. - I find the ideal way is to worry more about how to blend in with the masses of daily mail, NOT worry about whats the best way to deceive LE if you get caught.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But, if a shelf company, with fake directorships and shareholders and the relevant trusts etc work for you that's fine too. One thing LE CAN do easily is check on a company and its legitimacy. I'd consider this approach IF the company had some sort of legitimate function (meaning income and  taxes)

    Even better. If you have a legit business and an address where it is safe to receive packages, the advantage would be you are not using your real address. But not everyone has a legit business, and the fake business is an easy alternative to set up.

    Assume your talking about the US, here and most of EU, setting up a shelf company involves a lot of info and ongoing reporting regardless of whether or not it trades.

    IF you mean just make up a name and pretend its a company - I see a problem here to as IF anyone ever checks it on the national register its an automatic red flag.

    That's why its a good idea to have legit packages coming to the fake business as well. They shouldn't all be drugs. I think plausible deniability still applies. Anyone can send anything to anybody. Maybe order some fake advertising for your fake business on VistaPrint with your address on it if you're paranoid about it.

    I'm also concerned about that, like the IRS finding out about my fake business and wondering why I haven't filed any taxes. I suppose you can always claim to not be a very successful business and not be making money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I think the chances of that are slim. The post office's job is to deliver packages, not to check on the legitimacy of your fake business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Overall, I think there are benefits to using a fake business for deliveries over your real name.

    I know a little bit about this if you want some info, just flick me a PM and I'll help you however I can. If people rush into this idea they could easily make themselves a much bigger target than if they never bothered. Done right, there is probably merit though.

    Yes, they will see that you've been receiving many packages in that fake name.  Legit or not.  How can you deny knowing about Guy's plumbing when you've been continuously receiving packages in the name of Guy's Plumbing and haven't reported this error to anyone?

    *However*, I'd much rather some business name end up on a love letter (and whatever file that gets tossed into) than my real name. But not a registered business (or they're just a step away from looking up your real name anyway). Just some tiny eBay enterprise. Selling second hand (*non-taxable*) stuff.

    You have that backwards.  Personal amounts almost always get a love letter.  I have received about a hundred of these seizure letters in the last ten years of which about half were in my name.  Nothing ever happened so I don't really know about the whole building a case thing either.  The situations that I am aware of where they built a case or watched an address and investigated after intercepting a shipment were all large amounts of drugs and no letter being sent notifying the receiver of the seizure.

    I have to agree with Jack N Hoff here. I've been at this for over a year (as a buyer).

    <br/>
    In my early days here, I actually had the same idea. Then I read a lot of forum threads, as well as many vendor profiles, and I realized whenever they specify how to write your address, they always say, 1st line = Your Name. Some even stress "your real name that you receive mail by normally"

    Never, have I seen; "1st line = Your Name - Or Business Name". If you can find one out there that does, I'd be surprised.

    This is a non-starter for me. I'll keep ordering the way I always have, and I've had the love letter too, and it was a personal usage amount.

    <br/>
    I never stopped receiving or ordering, from Amsterdam, NY, to Amsterdam, NL.  ;)

    I think creating a shell corporation or "shelf" as some said, draws more attention.

    I can't say 'dumb idea', because I thought of it way back when I first started on here, and was pissing my pants on those first 3 or 4 orders.

    we have a legit business and the address is like  advertised on internet and such.. my packages are currently delivered to their.  i'm not sure it's any safer or better... but as a business owner i can always use some excuses like " we get mail from alot of people i'm not responsible for what comes in" ... it's very useful for money laundering cause the banks will always assume that the profit (if your making any of it) is legit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So i thought if your like a really successful vendor you should open a legit business and put your profits their :-) or atleast it will be wiser to invest your profits from illegal trading in legit businesses and much better if your planning on quitting on some stage!

    I'd have to lump my vote in with this. While I do share the fear of having others know my name, I don't believe (opinion :P) there is any added deniability towards a false business than just simply saying "I have no idea what this is, I don't know this person and I didn't order it." On the surface, as a person you have a (teenage or greater) lifetime worth of historical mail receiving... and it is hardly difficult to make "enemies" on the internet these days. However, I do feel that, if in denying something they call the bluff, the lie will seem more suspicious than my real name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The safest thing to do is blend in. The post office deals with a lot of mail, the more you blend in with the noise the better off you are. It's all relative - the harder you try the more obvious it tends to become. All it takes is one "Huh?" moment from a particular sorter, and any obscurity you thought the false company had... is no longer obscurity at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It may not be a truly good comparison, but I would lump a fake company name in the same boat as a fat stack of cash discovered by the cops. What matters is whether or not the discovery of said information is plausible enough on their end for the desire to seek MORE information. You can deny receivership, but once curiosity upgrades to probable cause you may find the plan falling through rather quickly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Providing a function is not necessarily a difficult thing to do. As stated in the quoted post... income and taxes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As someone else stated in the thread though... I suppose that is the benefit to owning a legitimate business :P

    The point is moot I feel. If you're buying personal amounts for your own consumption nobody really gives a shit about you enough for this to be worth it. All this cloak and dagger does nothing for plausibility, and probably has the side-effect of confusing your mailman, which can lead to something more pernicious if he has a bug out for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're buying bulk amounts, especially for resale, then the point is also moot, as you shouldn't be getting these delivered to your house to begin with.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's been said in here thousands of times, but is worth repeating: When you use your real name and address it sets off the least amount of red flags. Trust me, the postal police have seen it all, and this extra step does nothing to shield you legally.

    I'm with Jack. If anything you'll just be inviting more trouble.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First, getting mail delivered to your place in any name but your own forces your mailman to pay extra attention. (This goes double if he or she is not picking up outgoing mail related to the business, or if what's being received doesn't match the pattern of most home offices in your area.) So already you're inviting disaster.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second, imagine what would happen if a package were opened or investigated - because it ripped in transit, say, or because the vendor was picked up for other reasons. The additional work you did in establishing a "front" would work against you, not for you. Explaining why you're getting drugs delivered in the name of a business that doesn't exist is going to be way more awkward than defending against a few small deliveries in your name, and if anything will look to LE as though you're more deeply involved than you are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get that having another name on your package might make you feel better. If you think it through, though, it only increases the chances not only of intervention, but a more serious charge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's better to just pretend you're ordering some other expensive item online. In any other situation you'd do everything you can to make sure it arrives quickly and without incident. You'd use your full name. You'd use the USPS address verification tool to include your four letter zip code. You'd hope the seller uses a nice clear mailing label. SR shouldn't be any different, and the more you think about your orders as "normal" the more you'll improve the odds that others will see them that way too.
