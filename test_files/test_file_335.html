    I want to order some ADD meds because while I think I have a major problem completing tasks, if I start them at all, it seems next to impossible to get a doctor to prescribe to someone in their 30's.  I don't have access to a fake ID to get an anonymous PO Box, but I do live in a rental house that shares a mailbox station with other houses in the vicinity.  I get mail from previous tenants all the time.  Should I just use one of their names?  Or should I go through the trouble of finding something even more anonymous?  I also have a PO Box that gets mail from previous box renters, though not nearly as often.  TIA!

    Personally I would never use my real name, opinion is split on this issue and there must be a dozen threads on here asking this same question, do some research and make your own mind up. If you are ordering without tracking i.e. no signature required I cannot see the benefit of using your real name, this is an anonymous website no? and if you do order with tracking requiring a signature you are a braver man than me. The only downside I can see from using a fake name would be if your postman gets suss if you started to receive mail addressed to another person on a regular basis but given the amount of mail that comes to previous occupants to just about every household on the planet again I fail to see how this would ever cause any issues.

    if it doesnt look like junk mail though then it may be suspicious with the olds occupants name. if it looks important they may not deliver and forward the mail to their new address or return to send so they can send it to the correct address. if you have a priority mail package arrive that obviously wasnt going to be sent to the persons old address imo
    <br/>
    <br/>
    your chance of a non delivery are much higher, so dont blame the vendor or expect any refund if you dont get the order...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    people have different opinions, but even with the correct name for the person at the residence they still have plausible deniability that they had no knowledge of the package. even with the old occupant i dont know how much extra security you have anyway if you accept the delivery. except then you have to face mail fraud too for opening someone elses mail. even if they intercept it theyd probably investigate the current resident at the address and send the love letter to them anyway cause the postal system will have knowledge the old resident moved out due to mail forwarding

    yeah, just now there were two threads made about people who used a name other than the correct one and now they are having issues with delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    plus i forgot another story about someone who had to pick up their package from the post but they couldnt because they used the wrong name and obviously didnt have the ID to claim the package...

    well.. it's a rental home in a trac-home neighborhood build in the last ten years.  All of the houses have these community mailbox stations where everyone goes to get their mail, so the postal worker I think probably doesn't associate names to addresses.. So there's that.  Also, I have been getting old mail from previous tenants going back 3 levels for over a year, so these people haven't forwarded their mail.  I mean, 50% of my mail is in their names.  Got a red light camera ticket for one of them, as well as all sorts of unpaid bills/collections letters.. I think this woman at least isn't going to forward her address in then ext couple of weeks ;)  (and of course, they change the keys to the boxes, so she won't be able to intercept the mailing if she decides she wants to check her years old mail box on a whim -- i'm sure that lazy biatch didn't return her keys).  Thanks for the comments!

    Be careful though because I thought I was clever doing the same thing and it turns out that they do keep an eye out to an extent and will just give you the crap mail but at least return to sender the other stuff.

    Hmm good point.  I think I'll be OK though if a traffic ticket comes through.  Eh, it's domestic mail from a well known vendor.. I'll just use my name

    In your situation you might be fine since you've gotten legit mail. In my case it's typically students so I don't think they take the time to forward crap mail or whatever. I think the mailman just realized that such person doesn't live here anymore and sent it on back. Hopefully that's the case since I've not heard of students taking the time to forward mail.

    I have never used my real name.  This is because I don't want the vendors to have my real name and because my roommate and I usually split orders and neither of us wanted to use our name.  My postman will deliver any piece of mail to my place no matter what name is on it so I didn't think it would be a problem.

    yeah actually now that I think about it, at least a third of the houses near me are rental houses, with multiple roommates, so lots of different last names.  Probably the postman has given up.  I have RTS lots of mail but still get it from the same senders, so I gave up doing that.    OK, back to using fake name lol :)

    It could work but it just takes one mailman or clerk to connect two and two. But I thought it'd be fine too to t least use an old resident's name but after six days and no arrival I'm pretty much sure it's not coming. Snail mail is slow but not this slow.

    I ship about 8 things a day, and every 30th or 40th there is some kind of USPS hiccup (not including "tracking/confirmation" which is about 60% great and accurate).  I've had priority take more than a week in the same state, Express being marked "missent", etc.  You might have just won the lotto this time.  USPS is definitely not Six Sigma certified! hehe

    Even though i yet to place an order, at the time of this post, i will be using my real name. After all, if i take the other necessary steps to get coins into my account, know PGP &amp; the Vendor does his part, then everything should be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, doesn't the burden of proof on LE? From what i understand we're not responsible for what others send us in the mail , especial if we didn't order the package.
