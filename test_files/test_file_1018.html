    here is a little info for the UK resident
    <br/>
    some of you might know that already
    <br/>
    here is a message I got from Royal mail
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dear Mr silkroad
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you for contacting Royal Mail regarding mail to be delivered to you in the UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can advise that within the terms of our operating licence, Royal Mail is legally obliged to deliver items as they have been addressed, rather than to an addressee. Therefore if anyone posts an item to you at a particular address, we will deliver to that address, regardless of the name on the envelope or package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you have found this information useful and that this explanation resolves your enquiry and concludes this matter for you. If there is anything else we can help you with though, please contact us again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regards
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Good to know, cheers.

    Another point: I recently waited a looooong time for a domestic delivery. When it arrived, vendor had put postage on the back side above the (fake) return addy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It had collected a "No such address" sticker from RM, and was "returned" to the address on the opposite side, i.e. my actual address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I'm pretty sure that "the front" (destination address) is whichever side has the postage on it, regardless of whether it says "Return address:-" or whatever.

    Unusual? It was fucking retarded!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Out of 30+ transactions, it was the single worst looking package I've ever received, by a long way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It looked sketchy as fuck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The vendor, who I'd dealt with before and has an excellent rep, was very apologetic and compensated me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think he outsourced the postage bit...hopefully some staff training followed ;-)
