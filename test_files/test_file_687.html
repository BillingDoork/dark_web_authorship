    First of all this is not my Vendor name - the last thing I need is to get fucked over more than I have been.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Okay so my big fucking issue is that they WON'T give out these white tracking slips within an 80 mile radius of my location - believe me. I've checked every fucking Post office and grocery store. Hell half of them say they don't even have them! And "just do it online."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So what the fuck do I do without going into a Post Office and plastering my face everywhere? All over the APC and on the camera on the side of the nice Postal worker? Is there no fucking way I can be anonymous now? I'm a pretty well known Vendor. But I'm getting RAPED like a fucking rhino. Since I can't track my packages now! I sent a total of 20 packages from Sunday (the day the new USPS guidelines started) to Wed and ONLY ONE has finalized. FUCKING ONE! (who received it TUESDAY!) Which means I got totally fucked out of 19 orders and at least another 20 orders since WEDNESDAY.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can ANYBODY help me out??? Please either tell me on the board or send me a PM. I'm getting fucked here! Seriously can't anyone tell me there secrets?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fuck if you're a LEGITIMATE Vendor I would pay you at least $0.50 per white tracking slip you send me! Hell I'd buy 500 if I could! I need those mother fuckers BADLY! Think about it - You could make some damn good money!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way I need help and I need it fast. I easily lost $2,000 last week. FUCKING EASY!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PLEASE HELP!!! Either with the white slips or a way around this fucking mess!

    The green DCN stickers are still working fine. I just got a package today with the green DCN.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They may no longer sell them but I believe they will still use them until it's out?

    Do like me and countless other vendors did.... We simply do not offer reships/refunds now as a part of our agreement when someone purchases. I have it plastered on all my listings and to go read my vendor profile before ordering. SR resolution can't MAKE us track packages. If the buyer take the risk to order then its on them at that point. I am trying to figure out a nice way around all this but in the mean time I simply will not reship or refund. I haven't lost one package before so it shouldn't start changing just because I can no longer track them. Also a policy change to established buyers will now be needed to keep scammers at bay if you are worried.

    blueveil - sorry man the words on your settings and listings don't mean a damn thing. I messaged Admin these exact words to see if it would pass the test and they said that the bullshit you write doesn't matter worth a fucking shit. Basically it's between you and the buyer. So If you get 1 missing package out of 300 then you'll probably get the money from the buyer. But what happens when every week you start to get FUCKING SHIT HEAD SCAMMERS saying they didn't get your order? Now all the sudden your a selective scammer and like I said the agreement on your listing and setting page don't mean a fucking thing! That exactly what Admin said to me (without the cussing of course,)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been here in various forms (different Vendors selling different things) for the past 18 months and what I DO KNOW is that Admin will side with the buyer 95% of the time - maybe more which I think is fucking bullshit! Even in totally legitimate cases where you think there would be no way Admin would fuck you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Face it. It's a whole new game now. Unless you want to ship your package at the post and plaster your picture all over ever police station in a 150 mile radius then your totally and absolutely FUCKED!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also norcal420hookup I'm with you! I want to see these fucking magical white slips. I think their bullshit as NO POSTAL WORKER I'VE TALKED TOO HAS EVEN HEARD OF THEM - and I've probably talked to 1000 or more postal workers. Sounds like a bunch of shit to me! Especially after spending 2 days trying to find even a hint of them in almost my WHOLE state.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THIS IS BULLSHIT AND ADMIN NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW! THEY NEED TO MAKE A POLICY THAT IF YOU SHIP YOUR PACKAGE THEN IT'S UP TO THE BUYER FROM THERE! So far I'm getting FUCKED!

    Ok im a little confused.. I havent purchased anything since the change, But the issue is THE USPS are not handing the sender the postal slip? For tracking? But yet they offer tracking only bad thing is your gonna have to go in a P O To Obtain the Track slip? Correct? No longer can just have the Green DCN slips sent free from the site, cause they have chnged to full track mode and do not offer unless u visit In person to  the A P O CORRECT?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry i just haven't botherd to keep up since i havent ordered. Well i can say They are working on Packs coming from AUS to US. I had a pack sent Last thursday and its good to go..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well this suks. Allot of the buyers were never giving the offer of being giving the tracking anyway so im sure its not gonna matter to the buyer, but i can see how it can now fuck up vendors..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im gonna do some detective work..Yea im a detective for the SRDD..  SILK ROAD DETECTIVE DEPT.

    I have seen the white slips, I can confirm, they are a two part sticker, one goes on the package and the other stays on the roll... your tracking number gets printed on your receipt. Fuuck all that noise. If people wanna FE, then cool.. if not, I don't sell. Its not worth the risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I tell them FE over a certain amount I can afford if I need to reship, then Im a scammer. "Well, what if you dont send it?" they say.. then I'm like, whta if you get it and say you never did.

    Yea Both vendor and buyer are in same position now,unless vendors ship only certain day of the week and use a diffrent  P O and only allow a reasonable amount to send out where its not suspect. but just print fucking ebay stuff and clear tape over the package where it appears its coming from there.

    Well if any Vendor puts these tracking rolls up for sale them I'll be the FIRST one to purchase them. As long as there not like a dollar a piece. Fucked be reasonable people.

    I live VERY near to my post office, and am actually friends with the postmaster there. I will see if I can't get my hands on some for you guys. I'm only a buyer here, and mainly pot only, in personal use amounts, so i could give a shit less if i'm seen getting some tracking slips. Anyhow, I dont think it would be a problem getting them. But as the guy above me said, anyone who obtained these from a third party would have to trust said third party, no? I will update in the morning, I gotta pick up an order anyhow!!!
