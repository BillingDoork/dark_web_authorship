    Fuck, more than that! in china selling drugs is a HUGE DEAL. It is considered a crime against humanity basically and almost every charge results in death. Of course I would imagine this is for mostly the heavy hitters. I have heard laws in the other countries are damn near the same. But I know also that NK denies their public access to twitter, fb, and youtube. They try cutting them off from the world so they wont realize how misguided they are! But yeah its a pretty big fuckup to get caught over there and your likely facing death...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IF I HAD TO order over there I would save my money for YEARS &amp; find a vendor who sells EVERYTHING....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would make one huge fucking order. DO OR DIE&gt;
    <br/>
    literally.... It's an order that will need to last a lifetime so.....

    <br/>
    1lb of bud (use the seeds)
    <br/>
    18g's of coke
    <br/>
    30g's mdma
    <br/>
    20g's DMT

    1000 Rolls

    Given that most of the research chemicals, obscure psychedelics &amp; a good quantity of the pharmaceuticals sold on SR come from China originally I'd expect there to be a certain amount of diversion for the domestic market anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's also likely that given the relatively heavy use of TOR in certain sub-sections of the populations of China, Iran, etc - those that don't want their news &amp; information direct from the Ministry of Propoganda (or at least not their Ministry of Propoganda) - there are a good number of people there who've come across silk road &amp; who could've made orders.

    no chance of north korea hahaha they have a very carefully selected amount of censored info available on intranet for those lucky enough to get in front of a computer. weeds very much culturally accepted there though apparently people just smoke it like tobacco. not sure of its official legal status... kim jong un certainly looks like he got the munchies a few too many times

    contrary to popular false beliefs and mASS media generated Opinions China does have a rather large
    <br/>
    domestic Drug market that reaches from the lower to higher ranks of the political classes....
    <br/>
    there exists also many known international syndicates of chinese origin operating in China....
    <br/>
    and the same would apply to North Korea whos Military officers are renowned for smuggling drugs...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so like a country like Mexico it would probably be easier to source drugs at a street-local level in these countries than on the net

    oh excuse me I didn't mention that meth and heroin are legal, have you ever thought that maybe people like other things than heroin and meth? Yea I bet they are legal so they bulk sell the FUCK out of it to every other country. I wonder why, oh yes because they are the costliest drugs in the world. Not that your "tweaked out crack head would understand."

     oh excuse me I didn't mention that meth and heroin are legal, have you ever thought that maybe people like other things than heroin and meth? Yea I bet they are legal so they bulk sell the FUCK out of it to every other country. I wonder why, oh yes because they are the costliest drugs in the world. Not that your "tweaked out crack head would understand."

        Fuck, more than that! in china selling drugs is a HUGE DEAL. It is considered a crime against humanity basically and almost every charge results in death. Of course I would imagine this is for mostly the heavy hitters. I have heard laws in the other countries are damn near the same. But I know also that NK denies their public access to twitter, fb, and youtube. They try cutting them off from the world so they wont realize how misguided they are! But yeah its a pretty big fuckup to get caught over there and your likely facing death...

    back when i was in the ketamine game i used to get my ket from this chinese dude who had loads of it smuggled here (he wouldnt tell me how) but he told me that ketamine is dirt cheap in china he told me that one gram costs around 5 or 6 dollars over there (equivelent to in their currency) and ounces were like 75 or 80, basically the price that it costs here in the US. He also told me that all the teens in China are into k. This was a couple years ago and from what I've heard theyve busted somebody up there in the chinese mafia who was importing a shit load of kilos of k into Canada and from there into US. From what I understand most of the k around nowadays comes from Pakistan and India although a nice amount still comes from China and other Asian countries.

    I am currently in china and will be for a few months.

    <br/>
    Its true about the Ketamine, i can get a gram for about $15 and its pretty good quality. I haven't seen anything else but I've heard everything else is crazy expenses, like $50 for a pill of MDMA and ridiculous weed prices.
