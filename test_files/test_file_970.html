    Firstly sorry if this is the wrong section to post this in...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am trying to minimise risks in the unlikely event that I am raided and have realised that some digital scales with (probably) residue amounts of drugs on them is not a good look if the police want to prosecute me for trafficking or dealing or whatever even though I only buy what I use myself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I need scales that can measure down to 0.01 g at a minimum but what other uses are there for having scales like these and are there some other ways to measure things without digital scales?

    they're called jewellers scales for obvious reasons. i can't think of any other reason anyone would have them. TBH if there's residue on them you're fucked anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and they are the only way to accurately gauge dosage

    same scales are used by aircrafts modelers. "You could have such hobby". for example Hobbyking Retro LCD Pocket Scale 0.1g~500g. but I dont know if it very accurate.

    You use the scale to specifically weigh out your own dosages, because you are a responsible user.Â  You don't deal, you just weigh your own...

    You can claim that you are using the scales to measure out proper vitamin powder dosages - entirely legal and quite believable. You should of course have a few ACTUAL vitamin-filled pills to show that 'Hey this is what I use it for' if you ever get questioned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another good use for the scale would be as a measure of cooking ingredients - I just like having my recipes precise to the milligram!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While some places may question if you really need that kind of precision for normal vitamins (can't overdose on them so why measure?), you can just claim the very-normal innocence of an OCD-level of requirements. Make up a story of how you are sensitive to the dosages and why you need to measure things out carefully.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are many good reasons for having that kind of a scale. You just have to tailor your lies to whatever is believable in your situation ;)

    I bought a jewelry scale that weighs measures to .001 for about 25 bucks. I keep it in my kitchen next to powdered spices, becasue i use it to weigh "spices" for recipes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    edit: I just made that up, but maybe its believable

    In all reality just make sure all scales are clean and don't tell the pigs shit when they ask what they are for. Politely tell the officer you are not answering questions. Refer them to your lawyer if you must.
