    I have a heavy supply line in Colombia (east coast) for cocaine and heroin and I need the product moved by boat to US or Europe.
    <br/>
    It will be completely undetectable. I'm underfunded right now so I can't afford a long range boat of my own.
    <br/>
    Looking for a partner that can provide the boat/captain and move the product.  Any advice or offers are appreciated.

    And then what, ship in the mail from Colombia? Too much scrutiny on the receiving end.
    <br/>
    I've been here since October 2012 as you can see on the profile, also have a separate vendor account.

    Why on earth would somebody wanting to smuggle product from Colombia to USA or Europe possibly think it's a good idea to look for help on a public internet forum? Are you kidding me?!

    If you really had distributors in both the USA and Europe, as well as a solid supplier at the source, you wouldn't be here.

     It will be completely undetectable. I'm underfunded right now so I can't afford a long range boat of my own.

     Looking for a partner that can provide the boat/captain and move the product.  Any advice or offers are appreciated.

    Your question makes it pretty clear you don't have a clue what your talking about, hence you don't have access to what you claim.
    <br/>
    That's also why everybody is making fun of you. I will though give you a piece of advice: watch the movie midnight express.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To obtain the funding you might want to consider raising charity funds. You could claim you got arrested, for example.

    OP is a genius. Posting on the most watched drug related forum there is, about shipping narcotics through the most watched trade routes. This mastermind surely managed to fool LE into thinking he is a dork.

    Or you could get a lot of cowboy hats and have them float their way to america through Texas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That way LE will frantically be looking for drowned cowboys and ignore the cocaine hidden in the hats.  Last thing you will need is enough cowboys to come claim the hats.
