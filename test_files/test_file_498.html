    What could I do if my package has been returned to the sender? He/She has shipped me valid goods before they've made it to my doorstep A-Okay, but now the tracking labelled it as "Undeliverable as Addressed" which frightens me as the finalize date is in 8 days and if I have to resolve it could taint communication between the vendor and I as he is also reshipping an item I finalized early to inside the package that wasn't "up to par".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On that note, would my best option be to finalize now and leave a 1/5 and offer to change the review when the package arrives? How do you change reviews and ratings that you've given?

    Who is the vendor? Also, does the vendor hand-write addresses or use labels?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Answer both and I'll have some good advice for you.

    Don't leave a 1/5.  That could really hurt the vendor's ratings and a lot of people don't read the feedback, they just go by the overall vendor rating.  I recommend you click on "resolve" and once you are in there you can extend the finalization date by 5 days.  That way you can wait to see if it arrives without having to leave a low rating.  I am sure the vendor would be just fine with you extending the date, people do this all the time.  You can still finalize as soon as you get the package if it comes through, and it won't effect the vendor's rating.  You can still propose a reship or refund if you need to.

    90% chance this is OP/USPS fault and that the package wasn't received because either OP or the USPS fucked up. Without knowing the vendor or whether the vendor prints or writes, we can't be sure. Thus the %10 chance that it is the vendor's fault.

    If the vendor refuses any sort of leeway on a partial refund, reship or what not then maybe a 1/5 is warranted

    At this stage, it isnt. And holding a 1/5 as a hostage is only gonna make the vendor ornery and less likely to work with ya

    I used lettermail as signing for anything seems like a big no-no, but also means the vendor didn't put a tracking/confirmation number on it. The package is wicked expensive to say the least and no reships are offered with letter mail. Am I just screwed here?

    Apologies for being unclear.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On my last post, I was referring to another vendor with a totally different package, who has been gracious enough to offer a 'possible' reship after finalizing, the package being very costly, I asked because I was afraid that as I had ordered both around the same time, they were both flagged as Undeliverable and I wouldn't be able to tell if this package was still in transit or lost. I was just curious if there was anything I could do besides simply putting my trust in someone to give a shit about me after I forwarded the money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the first package, there is a DCN as well as tracking and I have yet to receive any work back from the vendor on whether or not he/she would be willing to reproduce and ship (I'd happily pay for shipping) as there was more than 1 item in the package to make up for the last item not working and almost getting me arrested.

    Resolve the issue IF tracking is available, if not then yeah, your screwed.
    <br/>
    That is why you pay the little bit extra (especially with a expensive order) for tracking. IMO the faster my goods get to me the better, why the hell would someone pay 10+ bitcoins on an order and not fork the other .5-1 BTC and KNOW where it is at all times. The longer a package is with a mail carrier, the more chance you take, remove your package from the carrier faster and reduce your chance of any misfortune happening to you.

    but this whole story sounds bogus since OP changed what he has said previously.... who knows, vendor could have fucked up the label

    It's not and more than likely the blame falls on USPS. The vendor has shipped packages flawlessly before and has kept great communication and a level of understanding thus far, but as he admitted, his services cost him a mere dollar to produce and cost a pretty penny. He's been great so far and the purpose of me asking about this package is to hear what options I have and to hear about any other experiences people have had where they had to trust a vendor beyond the finalizing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for the second package, I know I should've shelled out an extra 20USD for shipping but I've read multiple times on this forum that if "you dont sign, you're fine" and the only other available shipping option required a signature confirmation rather than simple tracking. Although, it would have been wise of me to ask if at all it would have been possible to get a tracking number. I was told that over the course of his numerous transactions, he had never had a letter not arrive. I was stupid and I hope he'd be understanding as he offers reprints as well for tracked packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, I did go back to the vendor because his packaging was flawless, but his prints had very noticeable defects that almost got me caught if it wasn't for my crackhead-running abilities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not changing my mind, I'm backpacking on my original question about a second package I had a question about. I made it unclear which I know might of came off oddly, but I can assure you... I'm not so mentally retarded as to start a thread about a package with tracking then mention that it didn't have tracking so I've been fabricating everything. Where would that get me? What would that accomplish?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My labels have been perfect and my mailbox clearly reads the name on the package.

     It's not and more than likely the blame falls on USPS. The vendor has shipped packages flawlessly before and has kept great communication and a level of understanding thus far, but as he admitted, his services cost him a mere dollar to produce and cost a pretty penny. He's been great so far and the purpose of me asking about this package is to hear what options I have and to hear about any other experiences people have had where they had to trust a vendor beyond the finalizing.

     As for the second package, I know I should've shelled out an extra 20USD for shipping but I've read multiple times on this forum that if "you dont sign, you're fine" and the only other available shipping option required a signature confirmation rather than simple tracking. Although, it would have been wise of me to ask if at all it would have been possible to get a tracking number. I was told that over the course of his numerous transactions, he had never had a letter not arrive. I was stupid and I hope he'd be understanding as he offers reprints as well for tracked packages.

     Yes, I did go back to the vendor because his packaging was flawless, but his prints had very noticeable defects that almost got me caught if it wasn't for my crackhead-running abilities.

     I'm not changing my mind, I'm backpacking on my original question about a second package I had a question about. I made it unclear which I know might of came off oddly, but I can assure you... I'm not so mentally retarded as to start a thread about a package with tracking then mention that it didn't have tracking so I've been fabricating everything. Where would that get me? What would that accomplish?

     My labels have been perfect and my mailbox clearly reads the name on the package.

    Oh shit, are we talking about counterfeit currency? That's what it sounds like, right now. If that's so, then I no longer give any fucks about this. Also, fuck any vendor selling that stuff.
