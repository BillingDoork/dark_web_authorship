    Trying not to let paranoia get the best of me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Usually, my packages go to an independent mail receiving office after tracking stating "out for delivery", but this time it says that it arrived at the post office (not even the same zipcode as me), then delivered. No "Out for delivery" or anything. Also says it's signed for by a name that was not mine. Could very well be a vendor mistaking me for a different buyer, but just in case, has anyone else had this happen before?

    If it was reused, it would be a pretty crazy coincidence. Same city, same delivery speed. Hoping it's not been intercepted or that I'm part of a CD, but the risk is always present.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What made me feel very uneasy was the part about about whoever received it signing for it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And as for me scamming the vendor, I have already brought to his attention the fact that it was delivered to a location different to the one I gave him. Waiting on a response from him.

    how would you prove that? couldnt any buyer just say that the address they sent to wasnt the one they gave them? if you sent it to them encrypted then theres no way for admins to verify this.

    Vendor responded, he's verified that it did not go to the location I provided. A 50% refund is in order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Doesn't sound like a good idea to ship to the same place, but then again it's been three days and I have neither been contacted nor been sent any sort of notification about this event. Still, real scary shit.
