    Hello,
    <br/>
    I am trying to figure out which would be the method that would raise the least attention. Say one is placing orders, and they don't often order stuff online (so getting lots of priority packages already might draw suspicion, yes?).
    <br/>
    Would it be safer to place all the orders you want from however many vendors (usually 2-5 each time), and receive several packages in the mail all within a day or two of each other, or
    <br/>
    would it be better to make one order, wait for it to arrive, then place the next order?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would think that if someone doesn't get anything but junk mail and then gets a spurt of priority and express mail, they're going to wonder. And can that wonder turn into anything more such as inspecting?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's just so convenient to buy your coins all at once and just order whatever you want before the value drops out of your coins! Alas, I feel that if something is convenient in this trade, it is also dangerous. Losing money and waiting a couple extra days seems like a better alternative to being noticed...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just curious what people think, hopefully someone who has first hand experience with postal work could help out here?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for your feedback!

    i think that the usps handles so much mail that it would take a lot to arouse their suspicion.. maybe big packages but small ones i dont think so.. so many people buy so many nick nacks and shit online all the time its like an addictiion.. maybe chances could be higher if it looked like you were receiving the same package over &amp; over again.. somebody other than me should probably anwer..yeah that would probably be the best course of action because i am pretty curious too..

    Think about it this way. If a package WERE to get intercepted, but it was only one, you could still potentially deny you even ordered it. But if there are others in the pipeline, that plausible deniability goes straight out the window. Try saying I didn't order a QP of MDMA when an HP of mushrooms comes in with it, or worse, the next day. Probably best to receive one at a time.

    Just set up a legit bussiness by buying stuff from amazon and re selling it or something on ebay. Just order a bunch of legal products from the and have them delivered to the same address as your drug packages. It wont raise any red flags, since you re used to ge packages due to your bussiness... I mean, its not that hard.. However you have to take precautions such as having packges delivered from abroad.. International packages from countries like the netherlands could be suspicious or maybe not.. just take precautions with vendor who live up to their stealth

    For Domestic: You should use smaller multiple shipments - as long as the packaging is on point you'll be fine. Like the post above says think about how much post USPS handles - it will take poor packaging or something out the ordinary for them to pick out a small package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Larger packages are more economical but carry greater risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Internationally: Small packages only with premium stealth. Multiple small packages if using multiple addresses/drops only. Avoid larger packages especially from suspect countries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just my personal opinion - see what works best with you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good Luck &amp; Stay Safe.  :)

    The scenerio where 1 package is intercepted and more are on the way COULD be bad, but I imagine that plausible deniability is still at play. If someone is trying to fuck you over by mailing drugs to your house do you think they will send 1 a week or all at once?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, about multiple packages at one time when you rarely receieve something, I imagine that is common. Whenever I have a project (gardening, electronics, gunsmithing, penis enlargement, etc) I order numerous supplies from mutiple vendors in a short time span. I highly doubt USPS flags this type of activity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am only referring to domestic shipping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    tl;dr I think you are good as long as the packages follow standard SR protocol. I am interested to hear other opinions on this subject myself. :)

    Good to know. I'm having to use my residential address because I really don't have any other options, so I'm trying to be as safe as possible. I'm sticking to really small orders for now.

    I don't like multiple orders but have still done it and choose sellers very wisely based on their shipping quality and stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the first is seized and you are approached about it still knowing you have more on the way, obviously play dumb and deny knowing anything about it and lets say they seize the next package a couple of days later, you could suggest that someone was using your address as a rat run if you like and haven't a clue what's going on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A friend of mine received a customs letter of drugs seized and was sweating because another order to the same address was in transit and there is nothing you can do to stop it at that stage but it arrived through safely a couple of days later!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Can't imagine customs monitoring an address after a seizure. Imagine trying to resource that as an operation considering how much post flows through daily  :o

    Shit sorry but my answer to your actual question is:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are ordering just one package per month then the possibility of seizure is obviously a lot lower but if you are ordering 3 per week then those chances have obviously multiplied.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In saying that, if you order once a month from sellers with terrible packaging and stealth then that is probably less safe than 3 per week from sellers with superior packaging and stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's all up to you and your instinct. I like to get a few in over a couple of weeks and then give it a rest for another month or so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    May the force be with the packages!!!

    I would say it´s better to receive one by one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If there is some customs-operation for 2-3 weeks and all your pkgs are on the way in exactly this time-period, they are all lost. And most probably you´ll get a visit from the "nice people group".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Order and receive one by one, and nothing tragic will happen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had the opposite experience, but I had different drops, so I only lost the material.
    <br/>
    This was due to my habit, to order like a child in the candy-shop, when I just received some BTC. That time it happened, that 5-6 pkgs were on the way.
    <br/>
    Nowadays I usually order one, max two pieces, but I try to receive one and order the next then (even if it´s difficult, I know)!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    peace to all
