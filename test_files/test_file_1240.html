    Friend of mine lives in HI and has been asking about getting a small amount of mescaline or mushrooms in the mail, personal amount.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know from visiting that they bio-scan bags at the airports to make sure nothing new is being brought in to the controlled ecosystem, but do you think they bio-scan the mail too?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any answers from experience will definitely receive karma, thanks for the help!

    You think they have the time to scan all the mail that comes in? Nah, there shouldn't be a difference. Just don't ship anything express and you should be set.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep in mind that shrooms grow well in Hawaii and they shouldn't be difficult to source anyways. Ask around.

    I answered this question at least as it relates to psilocybe cyanescens here
    <br/>
    <br/>
    http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137891.msg1217292#msg1217292
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and I'll copy that, but also add that psilocybe cubensis and panaeolous cyanescens already grow in Hawaii where animals have been domesticated. Cold temperate species like psilocybe cyanescens will not grow in hawaii unless it's at high elevations where it gets cold and you have the right wood chips. I'll also add that when Hawaii was formed from the undersea volcanos thousands of years ago, fungi was one of the first to invade naturally, because spores are small enough to float in the air and be carried by birds and insects. This was long before humans ariived
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *copied*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I actually know of one report where psilocybe cyanescens was cultivated in hawaii, but this is at a high elevation in a fairly narrow strip that gets cold enough at night for a couple of weeks. I think around 9000 feet
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise, psilocybe cyanescens will not grow in Hawaii because it's too warm. Panaeolous cyanescens grows natural in hawaii but that is a different tropical species
    <br/>
    <br/>
    since the packages are vacuum, it's not likely to show up on a bioscan and the only thing that could contaminate hawaii is the spores. Basically the spores of mushrooms travel worldwide in the air currents and jet stream anyway and any mushroom that could grow in hawaii has already done so
    <br/>
    <br/>
    to put it an even better way, most of the psychedelic species ONLY grow where humans themselves have made disturbances, whether it be domestic animals and cows and sheep, or tree cutting and wood chips. You will almost never find psilocybin mushroom growing wild in virgin forest where humans have never been
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so in terms of contamination, it's humans themselves that contaminate and this human contamination allows psychedelics to grow. This is different than most other wild life and plants that could upset ecological balances because psychedelic mushrooms are already a niche and directly related to human activity in the first place
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be near impossible for psilocybe cyanescens spores to invade virgin Hawaiian rainforest and displace wild mushrooms there. The only way one could get it to grow is to import hard wood chips (apple, walnut, pine, alder) and make a bed at high elevation where it gets cold enough. They simply will not grow in a Hawaiian rainforest without human intervention

    how do you think the mushrooms got there in the first place, spores blew across the ocean or got stuck to a bird or something. dont worry about fucking up hawaii, all the tourists are way ahead of you.

    Hahah, thank you for the responses guys. Great to hear, why shouldn't I have it sent Express mail Chong? Just curious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for the detailed description, Cyanspore. Great to know about mushroom life here, don't want to give away too much but the island he's at is actually the current wettest spot on earth at elevation... I'm sure he'd love to grow shrooms out there, but going hiking trying to find them is a different story. Great to know about shipping, will be ordering some (probably Cyanescens from you) in a couple days.
