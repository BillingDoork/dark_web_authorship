    Hey guys I've been just having a convo with afew buddies, Personally I think that ordering domestic-domestic would seem safer(Im on in USA)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But one of my buddies is only ordering from international because he sees it as a more safe option..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hoping to get some thoughts from some experienced members, I always order domestic if the price is right for the product but I have done a few international orders too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    thanks for your time and help! I appreciate it.

    Domestic is WAAAAAY safer.  Anyone who says differently is an idiot.  Customs can open any package they want for any reason they choose.  The only reason I ever order international is for bulk MDMA and things of that nature that are much cheaper and higher quality in Europe.  Domestic, even with mediocre stealth, has almost zero chance of getting intercepted unless it wreaks like pot or is dripping liquid or some other mistake no worthwhile vendor would ever make.

    This. Domestic shipping requires a warrant to open it, customs can open a parcel just cause they feel like it. IMHO, it's worth paying a not insignificant amount more for the added security that domestic vendors provide. I've had some parcels with close to zero stealth get across the country just fine.

    ^^ this!  Sorry OP but your friend is delusional! and not too smart either.  While I've never had anything opened that came from SR I have had dozens of care packages, birthday cards, you name it opened by customs who leave a little note saying why your parcel looks like it went through a meat grinder. These items came from 1 EU country and one Asian(least shady one I can think of). about 1 out of every 6 packages over the years has been oopened and resealed by customs. some containg small amounts of cannabis and or pills.
    <br/>
    I order my hash and benzo's from international vendors w/no trouble that I'm aware of but I do not expect that to remain the case. Although my highly rated hash vendor's stealth is good as far as smell detection it is not hidden at all and so a quick look would be the end. I tried a domestic vendor who has "the same product" listed for between 3 and 6 times the price(depending on quanity) and it is terrible hash and if you admit as much they blacklist like its their job. Not a great choice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im interested in whether different shipping options are safer.
    <br/>
    Is international express going to get looked at more often than regular airmail or other methods etc., and for domestic(US), what is the least looked at type of mail other than junk(bulk) mail.  I would think that the H stamp vendors would have great results using first class mail which is still fast instead of Priority/express but I don't know.I know many who are ordering H want it yesterday.  Also int orders usually expose your package to more shipping and airline employee's.  I know for a fact that airline workers love to steal any item that you may be afraid to claim as stolen and often enjoy leaving little notes where the item was stolen from.
    <br/>
    I would pay double to have my favorite vendor be stateside as I KNOW its only a matter of time before an order gets picked up by customs and at best I loose money and get my address flagged whivh would be real shitty..  I've shipped all over the world but because I'm not a vendor and shipping to myself or loved ones I'm able to pay the extra money to create real stealth packages, meaning if opened all looks normal and finding any contraband would be very difficult.  Domestic orders that get pinched are almost allways due to a snitch.
    <br/>
    I know I've been all over the place in this thread but this has all been on my mind as I've been putting off an order I really need because I'm seeing more and more undelivered items from a very trustworthy vendor, most or all are to the states and not just this vendor but a few others with great reps and no reason to burn someone for  50 quid. There is a trend if you're watching.  its been getting worse the past 6 weeks or so.(anyone notice this, even a little)?

     ive had quite a few with zero stealth make it over the pond as well but yes the risk is higher but the value + low chance of LE makes overseas a no brainer unless ur in a rush or tin foilin....thats me at least. the fact of the matter is lots of the general public are afraid to use SR domestic or international and even the people that use SR tend to be scared international. Not all of em of course, intl shipping is big biz and very high % but shit happens. gotta try to avoid cha and san from what ive heard. most vendors re ship. ive never lost one but i am sure it could happen at some point and if it ever does, i'll still order international unless something changes anytime soon.

    So you're trying to say that you go for International over domestic?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally I buy my products off the road first of all based on quality but also based on Safety, If a vendor DOESNT have great stealth reviews, even domestic then I won't order..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're ordering domestic a small lettermail(maybe if you had a big box of a pound or something if owuld be sketchy) But if you're ordering Domestic and receiving a small lettermail with good stealth you have pretty well NOTHING to worry about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the past 2 weeks there has been atleast 3 Raids that have been posted on here, all shipped international..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Doesn't this make you think about ordering International, especially from vendors who have almost no stealth? lol
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im not scared atall from ordering International, only because I only order from vendors with great steath..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT the simple fact that the package could be opened at customs(could get a love letter.. or could get raided like the others in the past few weeks..)
    <br/>
    makes it retarded IMHO to order from International IF you have the available quality/pricing in your area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like honestly what is the chances of your domestic lettermail getting opened? Roughly the same % of chance that Customs would open your order and Raid you instead of sending a Love letter..

    Yea, domestic shipping is way safer than International.  The fact of the matter is that domestic doesn't go through customs, and international does.  Especially coming from the NL there's increased suspicion since NL is known as a higher risk country to receive packages from.

    International orders make me sweat lol... They go through customs, have somewhat uncertain shipping times,  don't usually come with tracking, require FE in alot of cases or have low refund rates,  have much higher confiscation rates, and you are hit harder if you get caught.  I would only order small LSD amounts internationally.  Btw if you live in the US there is no need for international orders whatsoever,  they have everything under the sun (some not so shopper friendly, though).

    I've had around 10 orders so far and the only one that didn't make it through was domestic (all the rest has been international). I always order within EU though. I even got a resend on the domestic but I didnt get that one either, and this was from one of the most trusted vendors on SR. Havent had any problems after this getting my international goodie mail. So for me its been much safer with international mail so far. But ofc domestic is probably a bit safer.

    A lot of international orders require FE.  A lot of domestic do not.  Why?  Because a lot higher chance of interception on international, and the vendor doesnt want to take the loss.  Good stealth or not, it still has a lot higher chance of being inspected internationally, andd therefore higher probability of seizure.
    <br/>
    That being said, plenty of things do arrive just fine internationally.
    <br/>
    But as to the original question.  Domestic domestic is safest.
