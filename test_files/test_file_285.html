    Although the USPS doesnt guarantee overnight , generally it DOES come overnight unless you live deep in the swamps.

    Since my mail man already came im thinking a different vehicle comes later in the day for express mail...Does this sound crazy or accurate?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am new to express mail and between my coin not showing up for 3 days and the mail man just passing my house I want to pull my nuts off.

    Express mail will/can be delivered by different carrier. I have had both situations.  Either way, you have to sign.

    I have had slow ass across the world shit get seized and have had across the world express (5 days) come in no problem.

    I've ordered express a handful of times. I think one time it took 2 days, but its almost always overnight. I've never had to sign for an express package, and every time it's been delivered to me it was by a separate USPS carrier that was only doing packages. It depends on your area though.

    Between Canada and USA no matter what express method you select ( expedited, xpresspost, priority ) you have to sign if your mailbox is too small, you arent home to receive and get a slip or the mailman is just too fucking lazy to drop your shit off.

    We ship a ton of packages express. At least 20 THIS week (Halloween rush, I suppose) and nobody has had to sign for it yet that we know of.

    As for your question, yes, Express Mail can and does have it's own truck/delivery sometimes. They also deliver during the weekend sometimes as well (yes, even Sunday). It's a wonky service but it's quite popular with our customers.

    If the packages are international and they arent put in the mailbox, you will get a delivery pickup card thing that people always get paranoid around here about and have to go collect at the post office. There you would need to sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Reasons for these cards being left are: package too big, lazy mailmen etc.

    Yea we get cards here, too, sometimes. I posted in another thread, though... There was another thread I posted in that talked about picking mail up at the post office. The consensus was this: Basically, they aren't going to have someone there around the clock on the chance you stop by to pick up the package. If they want to get you, they'll do it at home.

    I figured I would chime in with my Express experiences incase any of the info helps anyone out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I order items via USPS Express A LOT...some from SR and some are just regular items I ordered online and I have yet to have a bad experience using Express.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my area, all the Express packages come Overnight/Before 12PM next day no matter where they're shipped from (I live close to a huge airport and USPS sorting center). I've never had a package not arrive before the guaranteed time although sometimes they do cut it close (deliveries at 11:47AM or 11:53AM, etc...but a lot of the times I will get them earlier like around 9:30 or 10:30AM). I have had a vendor ship me an Express package on a Saturday a few times before so obviously it's not going to get there overnight and the 2nd day delivery by 3PM is selected for Monday...I have always received those packages before 12PM regardless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A special carrier delivers all the Express mail in my area, I've never seen my regular mail man deliver any Express packages to me (he usually doesn't deliver the regular mail until between 12 and 4PM). Infact the other day I had 2 different Express packages delivered on the same day and 2 different special carries delivered them about 20 minutes apart from each other.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've NEVER had to sign for an Express package, most shippers will waive the signature (especially SR shippers)...the package is either left at my doorstep or it is left in my regular mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, I love Express but it's important that you use a vendor who knows what the fuck they're doing when it comes to shipping Express packages.

    As a former mailing industry worker, I can absolutely back this up, Express Mail pieces can and usually will be delivered by a random postal employee, sometimes even in their personal vehicles. USPS DMM states an Express Mail piece can and will be delivered by any postal employee. I've once witnessed a Postmaster deliver Express Mail pieces to a mail room on one occasion. I've also had a personal Express Mail piece delivered to my house on the 3rd floor where the postal worker dressed in the most old school style USPS uniform came in a snow storm in his personal truck, and actually came up my fire escape to knock on my door (even though signature was waived, sometimes they prefer to tell you in person if they can if sig is waived) just to ensure I got the package and it didnt get all wet in my mailbox. Whenever a post office receives a Express Mail piece they do they're damnedest to get it to you ASAP.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS has changed their polices drastically in the past few years, I've even had my mailman sign for a international express piece, leave it between my doors with a note "I signed, from mailman"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    USPS is actually becoming more drug friendly!!

    Something I've done a couple times with us and canadian express, is call the po in the morning and ask them if they have it.  This may sketch out some folks, but I've had no issue.  Especially if it's canadian, it requires a sig regardless, so that's a good excuse if you won't be home when the mailman comes.  The workers never seem to give a shit or think anything of it.  If anything, it would make a setup more difficult since you would see cop cars in the parking lot.  I call like 5 min. before I go, so if something's wrong they don't have tiome to set up on me before I can catch wind and get the fuck outta there.  All my orders have been small and non-smelly, though, so that makes me more confident.

    Ive used express mail several times and its never came overnight for me.  :-\  i guess cuz my po box is in the boonies. For me it usualy comes the 2nd day and even took 2 days a couple times. The weird thing is that ive had priority mail take the exact same time (2nd day) as express even though they were both from the same sender.
