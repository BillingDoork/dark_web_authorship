    I just had a package make it to its destination only to be returned because they couldn't find the address my customer gave me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was sent back, but I use fake return addresses so it's showing a "No Such Number" as the last tracking update.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So now they can't deliver it but they also can't return it. What do they do?

    When a package is undeliverable to the address as stated, and there is not a return address on the package, USPS will open it up and try to find out where to send it.

    Unfortunately, it's likely the same would happen in this scenario. Of course, if the item is packaged well, there will be no indication of where to send it. If they do somehow manage to find somebody associated based on the information, that person would still (thankfully) have probable deniability. Hallelujah USPS

    Im not sure the above is true, Im rather sure it just goes to a dead letter office. You could go prove its yours and claim it. To think USPS just rips open every dead letter is absurd.

    Yeah that's what I was thinking. I definitely won't be claiming it though.  :o

    I remember reading a while back that they scan it for valuables, and if they decide that there's nothing valuable in it they destroy it. Can't find that anywhere though.

    This is not quite the procedure USPS uses with undeliverable mail.  If it cannot be delivered to the addressee or return address it is sent to the PO's Dead Mail Office (now called Mail Recovery Center)in Atlanta,  There they will first try to discern a deliverable address from the outside of the mail.  If they can't the next step is to open the mail to try and determine if they can figure out the rightful addressee or sender.  If they can't come up with anything they hold it there for  period of time in case it gets claimed.  If its not claimed and has no commercial value(letters) it is destroyed.  If it has value it is held for public auction.  If it's contraband it's either destroyed or sent on to Postal Inspectors or their crime lab.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are sure it can't be traced back to you ..then you have no worries.

    Everything th3creeper said above is 100% true as far as I understand. A friend once sent me a birthday card with $40 inside, she put no return address and totally borked just about everything on my address (spelled my name wrong, put N 5th St instead of 5th Ave NW, spelled the city wrong, etc) and after about 6 months passed, I received a plastic bag in the mail with a note from the postal inspector, they somehow figured out my correct address and sent it to me, with the cash still inside...amazing and yet creepy how they figured it out!

    Every vendor on here should be changing their return address, labeling methods, external packaging, drop points, and using different stamp designs on a regular basis. Your goal should be for your shipments not to become familiar to any postal worker.

    they have a office for "unclaimed" mail basically returned and refused mail that has a phony return address, At that place usps opens the pack and tries to find to whom it belongs,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so basically That is not good. better hope the vendor is smart enough to use, gloves, alcohol wipes the whole 9 so no finger prints!

    When mail that can't be delivered remains in the usps possession(usually at some PO)..it's held for 30 days before being forwarded to the Dead Mail Center.   If you have a DCN for that package you'll know it was sent there by checking the DCN.  At that point retrieving  is totally up to you.  All you need to do is file a claim for it locally using the DCN as proof that you are the intended recipient.  This is where the men are separated from the boys..LOL!

    Yeah the only time the Post Office will open mail (without the package being obviously suspicious, e.g. ticking sound) is when the package can't be delivered and can't be returned to sender. This is why I use an actual address for the return address, most people won't open mail that isn't theirs, and even if they do it's a federal crime and the evidence won't be admissible in court.

    Happened to us a while back with a half p and all we could do is just bite the bullet man, not worth making a fuss about it to just go to jail in the end, As for driving 30 min away, i feel ya man, unfortunately it's not just that easy like everyone says it is, if you aren't getting atleast 5-10 sales a dayit's not worth it in gas to drop everyday at 30min drives. just costs too much in gas, but if you don't then your customers complain about shipping times, kinda a catch 22 if you ask me unless you're booming in business.

    yeah looks like you need to call this a loss. Also let your vendor know and hope he is professional enough that he doe not have any prints on the pack. Even though it sits for 30 days before it goes to the dead mail center and is opened. So like i said inform your vendor. dont use that address again and call it what it is
    <br/>
    good luck  my best wishes
