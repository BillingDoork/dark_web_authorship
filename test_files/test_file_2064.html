    I've searched all over and one person will tell me one thing and then the next person tells me something completely different. I figure with the experience of the folks on this site has been the best info i've gotten in the past so I would let you know whats going on and you might help me figure this out.  The USPS tracking site says the following:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Express Mail International®
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Inbound Into Customs
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Processed Through Sort Facility  August 16, 2012, 5:50 pm   ISC NEW YORK NY(USPS)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've been told this is still in customs and i've been told an equal number of times that since its in a sort facility its past customs and on its way. Any insight on what this means and what i can expect is greatly appreciated and thanks in advance for any help offered.

    The PO's system can be really frustrating, it isn't always updated when it should be, if I were you I would just clean house and wait for the delivery.

    ISC means that customs has it and is inspecting it.  If it clears which can take up to 14 days it will be delivered.  They will probably cut it open at this point and confiscate it.

    Your best bet is to post more identifying information about it on a known drug forum. You only put the exact time/date/location that your express mail was scanned last. people are stupid sometimes.
