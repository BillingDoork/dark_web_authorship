    I am new to SR, I joined a day before the site went down unfortunately  :(  Now that it is back up though, I am going to make a purchase!  So, the question is whether or not to use a fake or real name when shipping something.  I saw in the buyers guide that it said to use a fake name, and even a fake address.  I was hoping to not use a fake address, but what do you guys think from your previous experiences?
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance!

    I sometimes use a misspelt  version of my name. That way you can say "thats not mine as i never spell my name like that" or if you DO need to pick it up from the post office (which rarely happens) you can say they misspelt your name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just change a few e's and a's around and add a vowel.

     different people have different opinions on this, but personally, i recommend using your real info.  for one thing, most vendors won't offer a refund or a reship if you used fake info to begin with, because that could be a reason for it not getting to you.  if you use your real info, it's also a little less suspicious than suddenly receiving a package addressed to some new person at your address.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     just my opinion though!

    For the life of me I can't understand why so many buyers are so eager to risk their freedom by having drugs shipped to their homes addressed in their own names.  The name of the game in anonymity.  I'm not sure what is worse..not minimizing the risk of getting caught by law enforcement receiving drugs in the mail or giving out your name and addresses to your supplier.  Not all suppliers are who they would have you believe they are...just ask anyone who did business with tony76.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS...Those who think misspelling their name could provide them plausible deniability should their pkg come under closer scrutiny by LE....are fooling themselves. it won't.

    Just bumping this to see what people think.  For some orders, I have it shipped to my current address (usually benzos and the like).  For anything else (powder) I'm having it shipped to my old address where my buddies still live and spelling my last with a different letter at the beginning.  Good idea, or bad idea?

    Use your real name, I don't think I've ever had a package disappear that was addressed correctly :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also address format seems like it should be simple, but I get orders every day that aren't formatted right.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always make sure it looks like this:

    EXACTLY!   While your package MAY be delivered with less than correct info for the name,  99. 5%  of the time it WILL be delivered if the name &amp; address matches the current name &amp; address that are on all your bills!
    <br/>
    We have only had issues when people decide to get cute &amp; change up a name, or decide to use the old resident's name.
    <br/>
    And PLEASE if you have just moved to a new location, order a few cheap things from Amazon or Ebay to make sure that packages will be delivered in your name!

    The easier it blends in with other mail (eg. using your real information) the more likely it won't be intercepted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using fake info makes it more likely to look out of the ordinary when sorting (and thus the possibility of being flagged) as well as putting more risk on the vendor's shoulder's who is trying to get you your package safely and discreetly without having to reship or refund.

    quinone I see that, using fake info makes it risk free for the buyer but lowers the chances of getting your goods, makes sense. Using real info you take a risk but you know ... who knows what letter that is, you definitely have no idea what it is, what could be inside or who sent it. ;) very tempting to go ahead and see if something will pass through, would be a few nerve-wrecking days though for sure, and also one big risk is that the cops consider it a reason to put a full razzia on your home which they do for less here when it comes to drugs. :/

    fuckoffehbuddy, yeah that's the best choice but barely any domestic vendors for me. very high price compared to the rest of sr and there's a total of 5 different weed/hash listings excluding synthetics, where only the 3 weed listings are in any way viable but go for 17btc for 5g.

    Like so much else on here: we don't all agree on what's best...personally, I think a 'slightly' misspelled name is ok, but that's if you have a 'good' mailbox, know your mailman, etc.  I've known guys who used to get mail for the local homeless kids and the mailman knew he did it, and laughed about all the weird packages the kid's would get.  And also, seems like vendors have one view, and buyers have a different one.  Vendors get seriously pissed about people not using their real names...but then again, they aren't the ones who have to do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just like escrow: I make my own decisions and don't let people bully me around, and I"ve never had a problem with vendors *or* mailmen, yet.  Have had a ripoff or two, I"m sad to say, but oh well,( since 'Tony' got mentioned ha fucking ha...)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So think things threw, study your situation, and do what seems best for *you*...nobody on here has a lock on 'the right way to do things,' no matter how loud we shout! and just remember that if shit ever *does* go bad, nobody here will be able to help you, so act accordingly...

    How's this for an optimal solution? Use the name of past residents at your address, knowing that they're not using mail forwarding (I still get the occasional junk mail for them). Perfectly valid excuse why it would show up at your door if anyone were to wonder.

    soundbite, you never know if mail forwarding is on because even when its on, they do not forward junk mail. And sometimes they forward what they are supposed to and sometimes they don't. In usa anyway.

    What I did: I shipped a normal mail with nothing inside to my address with different name and it arrived correctly, and just kept that profile, same family name and different name, that works , but make sure you don't have any relatives using the name you use, otherwise he/she could have problems.

    I live in finland, which is pretty similiar in customs and postal services. And here, all Poste Restante post with fake names come under very close scrutiny. Also all poste restante packages are a bit of a gamble here. So real addresses are a must

    Thanks for all the info guys. I'm a first time buyer, just got some bitcoins loaded and now the only thing I'm worried about is using my real name. (aside from all the bitcoin 'tumblers' being down..) I'm still on the fence about it and the only thing that bugs me is using my real info.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here's how I rationalize it: I grew up doing drugs. And I know a lot of people who are dealers, I've sold weed and MDMA, and I know the profile, if you will. If the dealer on the other side is a reputable dealer like some of those I have known growing up, he really doesn't give a fuck who I am or where I life.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I'm not really worried about the feds, for I'm not buying anything that's easily detectable or anything. A friend recommended that I but something  small and legal to get a good feel for it. Viagra or something. All in all I'm going to keep reading through the stickies and doing my homework to make sure I get it right. This thread was very informative, however.

    I'm a new buyer, too. I decided using my real name was the way to go. It bothered me too, but when I'm in sketchy situations like this, I always tell myself to treat the situation as if I'm not doing anything illegal (with realistic exceptions of course, don't misconstrue that and give me shit for it). My personal policies are these: 1) Only buy from a reputable seller who clearly isn't a moron, doesn't send obvious packages, and seemingly has just overall sensibilities and good feedback. 2) Only buy domestic (this is probably a lot easier if you're an American). It sucks for new sellers, but I can't risk helping them build their reputation, it just simply isn't worth the risk for me. I placed an order from Hatter26. My friend insisted I find something cheaper (we're splitting it) but his rep is so good, and his policies and just the way he goes about everything seems so sensible and legitimate, so I insisted on him. I just personally think going about this in a way that will make packages look as normal as possible is the way to go. I don't know, just my opinion. If it goes smoothly and I'm happy I'll probably stick to this plan.

    I honestly believe this depends on your mail man/ mail service. I use an alias, and have had 23 successful purchases - I realize there is risk involved with this, and I accept full responsibility for this if a package doesn't arrive, which it hasn't (except for one scammer). At my house though, there is often mail for different people (old tenants?) and we don't know the mail man at all. I have lived places where they wont deliver if the name is on the mailbox. Perhaps you could try and send a few things to your fake name and see what happens? Or put a name on the mail box? Or just use your real name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reality is, if you follow the rules, you're pretty safe. The rules being 1. don't ever buy anything that requires a signature, and don't ever sign anything if someone comes to your door, and when you are checking out a seller, be sure lots of people comment on how well the product is packaged. Personally, I have never received a package that looks remotely sketchy, and that is key.

    If you were going to use a fake name, doing something such as sending some mail to yourself with the fake name/alias might be a good idea.  Personally, I wouldn't use a fake name.

    Well, my first purchase on SR came in the mail today.  I used real info on everything, and there were absolutely no problems at all. The first purchase anxiety is gone  ;D  Very impressed with the stealth packaging as well.  So, now that I have purchased something, IMO real name and address is most likely the way to go.

    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am of the opinion that it is best to use a fake name when receiving. Postal workers don't go through the trouble of cross referencing names to addresses, they are just too busy delivering the mail. Plus, if they do a controlled delivery you can just say you don't know the name on the package. The benefits of using a fake name far outweight the drawbacks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, there's a show called "To Catch a Smuggler" produced by the National Geographic Channel, I've watched it on YouTube, and on one of the episodes, they were filming how they find drug packages at JFK airport. They found a package of heroin, and they realised that the person used a real name as that name was already flagged from another address/drug shipment and they setup a controlled delivery (CD). The officers were in disbelief that the receiver was STUPID enough to use their real name and had a good laugh.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you haven't watched the show, do yourself a favor and watch it, there's a lot to learn straight from the source.

    Depends on the country I think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the UK they don't cross reference address with names so you can always use a fake name and not have to worry. You're everyday postman isn't going to be really caring about who it is addressed to, he just wants his day to be finished asap. And if you just order some random catalouges to your house using a fake name then it wont seem strange when packages come.

    I've got nothing to add on fake name vs real, just something I've noticed.
    <br/>
    First, at all the rented flats I've lived in, I always got mail from previous tenants, often numerous different ones.
    <br/>
    Second, lots of junk mail is addressed to "current resident," although I've never seen any sr packaging that could even come close to being considered junk mail.

I'm not too worried, my wife orders a lot of stuff, we both do and we send a lot too for her mail order business so I'm not tripping at all. Our mailman is way cool too, probably wouldn't say anything even if he suspected.

    what if i hated you because you fucked my girlfriend and killed my dog and i sent you a half ounce of the firemost i had laying around using your real name and tipped off the fuzz? are you expecting to go to jail for it? think about it for a second. there has to be some type of precedent for something like this, no? but yes, yes there is. your best bet is to do amazing amounts of research on the vendors and choose wisely. since the postal service must be savvy enough to figure out who you are from an exit point on the network, (which would take time and $$, both os which the usps does not have right now) you can always deny you had any knowledge of what that package is. just remember, cutting your losses upon non-delivery is the best course of action if you are working with a trusted vendor. dont go pick up any packages, dont accept any package that is being delivered by a knock on the door, and clear your space of contraband immediately if you have any suspicions about your package not getting there. if you are working with a good vendor there will be constant communication about your order and its location, and a lot can be determined about its whereabouts with both customer and vendor working together. Although I have only made a limited amount of purchases on SR, I never thought twice about using a real name as it is a clearer way to deny i knew anything about its contents And  I can tell you that one of the better vendors out there :cough,,,NCK: has given all the best information.

     Of  all the packages we have sent out that didn't arrive, one had given us a bad address, one fell off the face of the earth, &amp; the other 7 were because people didn't use their real names!  So quit giving bogus opinions, &amp; stick with the program!

    Couldn't agree more NCK.  After doing a lot of research and thinking about the different options, it's pretty obvious that using your real name and address is the way to go.  It is way more suspicious to get something at your residence that is not for your name.  Not only that, from what I have heard people are using fake address' and then going to pick it up....that is insanely stupid.  Be smart people.  8)

    One big thing here for those who advocate using fake names: perception matters. Ever watch Cops and see how many obviously guilty parties use the 'its not mine' line? You think that becomes a more plausible defense or less plausible defense when there is a package recently sent to a name the letter carrier has never seen before? Especially if your first impression (perception does matter in these cases - especially if you are prosecuted and end up going to trial!) is anything other than an above board citizen?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are caught and use a fake name your plausible deniability defense is shot. But if you are a normal citizen who knows their letter carrier and has always exchanged pleasantries of them and you have made a good impression on them that regularly receives packages from here and there or everywhere and doesn't ever buy from established vendors who ship well, and suddenly receive a sketchy package that ends with you talking to the police, can you really except the plausible denaiability defense to make it very far?

    I would always try to use a REAL and LEGIT name and address to ensure delivery without failure.  The best thing you can do is have your incoming mail blend in as much as possible.  give no reason for it to stand out.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Much also depends on your mail carrier and country obviously. some mail routes have the same person(s) and they will often have a pretty good memory of what names normally show up on mail to each address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the easiest thing you can do to avoid an issue even while using your real name for delivery.  When you get the package, take a fat black or red marker and write "Return to Sender" across the envelope/box and do not open it for at least 24 hours.  When the authorities (at least in the US) conduct a controlled delivery, its within several hours of it being delivered/by the end of the day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everyones circumstance is different. but a basic rule of thumb here being you should use your proper name for your incoming orders.  most likely to get what you ordered and least likely for your order to attract attention.

    I used to live in an apartment building where each mailbox had the residents' name written on it. From time to time, the mailman left mail on top of the mailboxes, which was addressed to some previous residents! So theoretically, if I used a fake name it would have still been delivered  :) Unfortunately, there was no SR at that time ;D
