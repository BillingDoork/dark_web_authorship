    ok I have to ask because for so long this has been a mistery to me.  Why is it every vendor is willing to ship priority but not express.  If you go to your post office and get some express envelopes, and forms, fill them out at home, and drop them in the blue "express" box, how is it any different.  Im sure Im missing something, I know the blue boxes for express shipments are much more sparse than regular boxes but theres seems to enough where you wouldnt have to drive more than 5 minutes out of the way.  Plus if you want charge a little extra for the drive, if they are buying express they will most likely pay for it without a problem.  I must be missing something, I pretty much only ever order express.  And I've placed enough orders, seems like priority is riskier because sometimes it gets missent or theres a problem, ect.  Express is gauranteed

    Part of the reason, I think, is because Express Mail packages are looked at more closely than Priority Mail.

    You could be right, obviously I don't know.  But my guess is, no they arent.  Looked at by who?  no one is looking/cares at a domestically shipped express shipping anymore than they are the other 10,000,000 express shipmnets they got today.  What would make someone think that?  but lets say they look at it, good, first off I dont think anyone at the local post office cares, second, whose got time to analyze someones mail when its gotta be there tomorrow.  they take it with the rest and bring it to where they have to.  Thats what i think.  In that regard whose watching all of fedex and UPS overnight shipments.  yes i know they can open it if they want, but they are being watched by post office "watchers" then no one is watching fedex and UPS unless they hired there own police force.  Check fraud, child porn, mail fraud, letter bombs, this is what is looked for and not by just seeing a package in a box, and it doesnt happen by seeing a typical overnight package.  Something happens, like a tip or whatever then an investigation would start.  When millions of packages are sent overnight domestically everyday, unless theres a specific reason, "they" arent looking.  Just my opinion

    I totally understand, and I would be also, but you don't have to.  The only thing you would need to do is get some boxes and labels to fill out then fill them out at home.  Then later on drop it in an express box near you.  There are only two near me I know of not at a post office when theres a regular blue box every 50 feet it seems, but if you look you could easily find a couple that are nearby in like a medical office parking lot or something.

    Couple things come to mind, and I could be way off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Express mail isn't guaranteed overnight to all locations. Since the buyer doesn't have the vendor's zip code (obviously) there would be no way for the buyer to check if it's guaranteed overnight to their zip. Situations could come up where Joe Smith in bumfuck Idaho gets angry because he spent 20 bucks for express and it took two days. Bad feedback?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. Express mail must be dropped off at a certain time to be guaranteed next day. It's different at every post office, even within the same town. Some post offices express cutoff is as early as noon. Seems like a huge PITA for the vendor to have to make a special trip for one eager beaver's express package at noon, and then another trip for everyone else's package late afternoon.

    As I've read on other threads one of the flags of a drug package is the use of express postage.  I think that right there is enough to make me steer clear of it.  It's so tempting because I'm always nervous until a package arrives so it would help ease my mind by having it come quickly, but it's an increased risk of being discovered.  Advise against it.

    I don't remember where I read this but it was one of the shipping threads on here, I think it was one of the stickied ones.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, express items ARE scrutinized much more closely, reason being is that they have to deliver it as quick as possible. They are handled with caution and if they fail to deliver it overnight, the workers get chewed out by managers and the such. Also, if delivery is impossible for whatever reason, the workers will inspect the package for any clues or tips as to where it should be delivered. They may even open the package to see if anything would be in there to give them an idea of what the actual address is. Again, I'm going off memory here but express packages are inspected more thoroughly due to them needing to be delivered practically overnight.

    It's possibly further than a few states that gets mail put on a plane. But trust me, priority and first class most definitely get shipped by plane in many circumstances. "Gettng x-rayed" because it's been put on a plane has absolutely nothing to do with the supposed higher risk of express mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've done a lot of legitimate and grey area shopping on the internet over the years where there's actual tracking. Something shipped priority that's sorted at a west coast city the evening of the day it was mailed, that's sorted again the next night on the east coast didn't get there by truck.

    I don't think that is true about them being able to search it man, I just read through a few of the stickies and it seems that they are not allowed to search or detain a first class, priority, or express package without probable cause. But hey, maybe I'm wrong.

    <br/>
    [/quote]
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I honestly am not sure if this is sarcastic or serious so I'll just reply as if its serious.
    <br/>
    1) If you sell anything on ebay, amazon, ect. don't you already have a bunch of both the priority and express envelopes?  Im not a vendor but i do.  Also just in case i need to send something, i also have fedex and ups envelopes.
    <br/>
    2)  No I don't know the highest denomination stamp you can buy but I do know the lowest is $0.17 so if you really wanted to for no reason put $20.00 worth of 17 cent stamps on the flat rate express envelope and drop it in the "express" box that would work equally well as if you  buy 1 express stamp at a kiosk with a prepaid visa gift card.  So the latter is obviously easier, but technically both would work the same, and i've had to do things like this many times, For example,  if i happen to have a book of forever stamps ill load up a priority envelope with them, usually till its just over the $5.90.  It looks funny but its still the same
    <br/>
    3) if you want to pick up some envelopes or offer that shipping option either way is ok with me,  (I prob. would say its helpful to have regardless) but you can go whenever you want, it doesnt have to be tomorrow and why your face is red I don't understand at all, (this makes me think its sarcastic which i really dont understand when plenty of top vendors offer express, and it would make you more money, but its up to you, Im not THAT concerned)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But the person who posted about the specifics about gauranteed overnight is 100% legit, understandable, and true.  Sometimes the cutoffs are early, boxes far, so it would be annoying, and in my opinion more of a pain than what its worth unless you live near a post office hub like I do and theres an express box close which last pickup is actually 5:00pm.  But I'm sure thats not the case for almost everyone, but I think its worth looking into, and like I said, jack up the price on just the shipping, no one has to choose it, make sure its enough to where its worth that one order for your time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Check out the prices for the 3rd top seller domestically for speed, theres one reason he can charge that, and get more sales than anyone else, and thats because he ships everday and pretty much 100% of his orders are express.  He is like clockwork so hes the go to guy at least for me on any friday, ect. where im in a jam because its known to anyone the orders speed, if you get your order in before 3:00 pm,  100% of the time its sent express that day, (hes as reliable as it gets)  Im guessing 90% of the time it arrives the next day. Maybe less, that he doesnt have control over (it all depends on USPS) Regardless, im just curious why most dont even offer the option?

    ok I just checked out your vendor page, so you actually were being sarcastic, well now ur face should be red because i've made more purchases than you have sales, You have sent out 50 orders.  In fact i have sold more shit on BOTH ebay and amazon than you have here and i promise  you are unclear about mailing,  only because you dont mail much.  I can tell, not because you only have 50 sales but because your statement. So i suggest not being so funny, and instead go to usps.com and read the services tab.   My previous response would be for vendors who do ship quite often, whether on here or not,

      I don't think that is true about them being able to search it man, I just read through a few of the stickies and it seems that they are not allowed to search or detain a first class, priority, or express package without probable cause. But hey, maybe I'm wrong.

     All first class mail is protected from searches without warrants. First-class mail is generally classified as personal correspondence. Also, first-class mail entails snail-mail, priority, and express services.

    Express can be searched without a search warrent while priority can only be searched if they have a warrant or a dog detection."

    This is wrong and Im just curious as to why you say that because you didnt read it anywhere.  But maybe you heard that from someone else?  I honestly dont mean that as an insult so please dont take it as such, Im only curious because i think theres a lot of people who think this same thing.
