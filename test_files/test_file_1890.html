    Hey there everyone i was wondering if receiving multiple packages from green states would alarm usps postal inspectors?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I placed an order for some edibles, small order, went out first of the week then Thursday got a couple Oz's shipped which are now on the way the edibles arrived yesterday. The second order of the Oz's should arrived today or tomorrow, should i be stressed or worried about this?
    <br/>
    Reason i ask is because both packs come from "different green states", even though the first pack was a small one it still worries me, the second order shouldnt be bulky either.

    I wouldnt worry about it.  ive received multiple orders from "green states" in a short time-frame, even tighter than yours actually.  mine werent for green which i guess is kind of ironic.  People have actually said that currently with all the budget issues USPS is having, there aren't many postal inspectors, at least not as many as before, and they are tied up with internal affairs anyway.  (Making sure the mailman isn't napping between pickups etc.)  You should be just fine, I worry a lot too, so take it from someone who is prolly more paranoid than you : )  you will be just fine.

    I hear ya man thanks for the advice i do worry a alot! The only weird thing is my last two packages i have gotten had marks on the front and that is unusual all my last packages did not have any marks. These last two had marks one package had a x written right besides the return address. And a long line crossing all the stamps. This sound weird or unusual to any of you guys??

    What were the other marks?
    <br/>
    The marks through the stamps?  Could have just been the postman manually cancelling the stamps so they cant be reused.  I think they usually have machines that do this but please dont quote me on that.  More likely even is that it was a different mailman than the one who regularly works your route, and this guy was being overly diligent and cancelled the stamps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The x next to the return address is kind of weird though....My gut instinct is that the return address got run and came back as non-existent or flagged.  (Maybe the vendor had a package get "returned" to that address and the business reported it to the post office and police.  I don't know for sure but I would think that if it were the "x'ed out" return  address was flagged, they wouldn't have delivered your package, and definitely wouldn't have marked it so that you could see anything.  So most likely it was just that the address didn't exist...That's my best logical guess.  As far as the stamps go that's not unusual whatsoever bud.  Just their way of negating them and making sure they don't re-sent/reused.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Curious as to the marks on the other package but I don't think you have anything to worry about, especially if they actually delivered everything and you made it back on here to post about it.  That's always good news for sure.

    Well that's really good to hear! I received both packages safe and sound, just that the mark get to me. although the stamp mark isnt nothing to be worried about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Except i received two packages from 2 different green sates about 3 days apart. The first package just had a straight line about less than half a pencil of length right besides the return address/my address (and a bit on the addresses) The second pack arrived well to except it had a similar mark around the same area as the first one right besides the return address. So i find it very weird, Should i worry that my addresses my get flagged? Or am i just being to paranoid .. Hmm
