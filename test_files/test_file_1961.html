    I had a vendor look up a package that was taking a lot longer than usual. He has the DCN, but will not give the numbers out, which is understandable. Anyway he said the the tracking came up "undelivered". He said he will reship tomorrow. So, does this mean the package was intercepted by LE? I have asked the vendor for more info, but i haven't gotten a response yet. What i really need to know is my address fucked and should i be wary of a controlled delivery? This was a domestic package so no customs involved. At least with customs you know all your going to get is a LL, but I've never had anything like this happen with a domestic package. I am worried the troopers are gonna be kicking my door in tomorrow. Any info would be appreciated.

    it's hard to say without seeing the actual dcn info. It could have been misaddressed, like a typo in the zip or something, or could have been confiscated. if i were you I would clean house and have him reship to an alternate address, don't order anything else to the previous address for awhile and wait for things to cool down, but most importantly, clean house just to be safe!

    It could be that you weren't there to sign for the package ? And they sent it back to the post office as a failed delivery , they may try again the next day or maybe left a note of some sort to come collect it ?

    I really wish i had more of the dcn info as well, would be nice to know at what point in the delivery it became undelivered. If its on the senders end i would feel alot more comfortable than if it came all the way to my post office then got intercepted. Shit has me super worried, but the vendor just seems like it was no big deal and was going to reship right to same address. I sent him an alternative to be on the safe side. It is a tiny order like 250mg, but could really fuck up my life if something really bad happens. Don't you think at his point the vendor should provide me the DCN or at least copy and paste all the info that is coming up?

    I can understand why he doesn't want to give out DCN, but i think he definitely has the responsability of showing you the exacct info from the DCN

    don't get worried man, just smoke a bowl , clean your house, and just ask a buddy for a favor. They have nothin on you

    I agree that he should give you the dcn at this point, there may be something else going on here that the vendor hasn't shared with you, but like the post above said, best to just clean house, use an alternate address and wait for the next package.

    Unless the vendor hand writes each shipping label, the address would be correct unless you didn't give it correctly in the first place.  Most vendors will copy, cut &amp; paste what is sent to them by the customer, so if it is actually undeliverable it's a fuckup on the customer or usps.  Which is why we don't refund.  It's not our fault if either fucks up with the address.

    Ended up just being lost by USPS, vendor was cool about it and reshipped. I didn't look to close at the reship, but almost positive my address was hand written, so maybe he made a mistake. He was also nice enough to send the reship overnight. I was a little worried having it go to the same address, but it all went over well. Now i kinda wonder if someday the original will just show up. I have had that happen with IOPs, but never anything domestic. Would be cool if it does and i will def pay for it, just a thought. Also, should I assume my address is fine to use since the reship made it with no issue, or would you guys still use an alternative?
