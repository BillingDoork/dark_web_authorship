    If someone were to ship adderall domestically what kind of stealth would be required? Could they simply be placed in a bag between cardboard and placed into a regular envelope? Would they need to be vacuumed sealed? Thanks!

     You have a few options. Here's the main two.

     <br/>
     1) Order from solid vendors with good reps for stealth
     <br/>
     2) Use the search function, figure it out yourself

    The OP is considering shipping adderall, not ordering it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Furthermore, every user who has ever used this forum is aware of the search function... some still want to pose their own query and it makes no sense for you to redirect them as thus. It would be far more reasonable to withhold your reply entirely, since you clearly consider this users issues unworthy of readdressing.

    As a third party, I take offense to your brief attitude and would encourage you to checkout the spam threads for your future posts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To the OP.... although I am not aware of the relationship between drug sniffing dogs and adderall.... I would still encourage you to purchase an airsealing unit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make sure you're not letting the pills rattle around, are deterring crushing, and deterring tearing. DVD cases are often used over cardboard.

    This is good advice. Although I've read that NO dogs are trained to sniff for Adderall, it's possible there are a few. So the proper precautions should be taken - mylar sealed bags. At least a bubble mailer will be needed - like Smashmouth said you want to prevent anything in the parcel from moving around, and of course prevent your pills from being crushed.

    I have tried to the search function but didn't find many good threads on the subject. I'm not totally new to this, nor do I "GOTZ add". I was just trying to gain some additional information. I do understand how you might be annoyed at seeing a question like this as it seems like something that may be asked often. But I was not able to find that much information at all about shipping Adderall.

    Some decent stuff above. Good point from Aurelius Venport. Duplicate how other vendors ship. I have never heard of any doggies sniffing out adderall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can go to many stores and choose from a number of big and little things to stealth ship in, pending the amount. Get creative! Use 3 day Priority w/ tracking (which is included now) and you're set. Easy to ship 30, 60, 90 pills this way. Guess you could do the cardboard thing for only a few pills.

    You didn't answer the OPs question at all. He obviously has never ordered from a professional vendor, and needs to buy from a handful and see how they package it to get an idea of what proper packaging looks like. The OP knows not to let the pills rattle around and crush!! He just has no clue the specific detailed technique on how to do that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OP, please take the time to learn from the established Adderall/pill vendors by making small purchases from them before deciding to get into shipping anything yourself. The method you desribed, just using a baggie in an envelope, is the absolute WORST idea. You need multiple layers of packaging. The baggie should be heat sealed or taped closed, it should be furtherly taped inside of something to hide it, then stuck inside a padded envelope to prevent crushing, then put in a larger envelope to help keep it extra safe in case the outer layer of packaging is destroyed en route.

    FWIW Adderall is amphetamine at a 25/75 levo/dextro ratio.  If dogs were not trained to sniff out amphetamine, then I doubt there would be nearly as many speed seizures as there has been in the last 25 years.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also think its unlikely that they could train a dog to sniff out "amphetamine specifically made in clandestine laboratories."

      Hi College Helper,
      <br/>
      <br/>
      You have a few options. Here's the main two.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      1) Order from solid vendors with good reps for stealth
      <br/>
      2) Use the search function, figure it out yourself

     The OP is considering shipping adderall, not ordering it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Furthermore, every user who has ever used this forum is aware of the search function... some still want to pose their own query and it makes no sense for you to redirect them as thus. It would be far more reasonable to withhold your reply entirely, since you clearly consider this users issues unworthy of readdressing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As a third party, I take offense to your brief attitude and would encourage you to checkout the spam threads for your future posts.

     To the OP.... although I am not aware of the relationship between drug sniffing dogs and adderall.... I would still encourage you to purchase an airsealing unit.

     Make sure you're not letting the pills rattle around, are deterring crushing, and deterring tearing. DVD cases are often used over cardboard.

     Some decent stuff above. Good point from Aurelius Venport. Duplicate how other vendors ship. I have never heard of any doggies sniffing out adderall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You can go to many stores and choose from a number of big and little things to stealth ship in, pending the amount. Get creative! Use 3 day Priority w/ tracking (which is included now) and you're set. Easy to ship 30, 60, 90 pills this way. Guess you could do the cardboard thing for only a few pills.
