    Just a heads up that a product shipped from EnterTheMatrix never arrived domestically. This is quite worrying as domestic shipments through AusPost should have a flawless record.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either LE have triangulated ETMs' return address, or they are generally cracking down on suspicous domestic shipments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I never expected this to happen from a domestic order, and the vendor in question didn't care when i expressed my concerns about this indecent.

    Let's clear this up Foxtrot77:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - You have no buyer rating.
    <br/>
    - Your ordered regular post (No tracking)
    <br/>
    - You claimed non delivery.
    <br/>
    - We offered you a FREE reship
    <br/>
    - You denied and then wanted a refund by BLACKMAILING feedback.
    <br/>
    - We accepted your claim and issued 60% refund as per our policy when in actual fact you deserved nothing.
    <br/>
    - You replied and told us "Suck a dick, cuntface." among other things. Charming...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We will provide the entire chat transcript to SR admins if necessary and we will not engage in any further discussion with you. In addition you have been mentioned in the Vendors Only Forum as a confirmed scammer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have proven yourself to be vile, distrustful and completely against the ideals of this community.
    <br/>

    Have a nice weekend,

    This thread is for buyer considering order from you, keep your propaganda out here.
    <br/>
    You offered 60% in-store credit with the fabulous Matrix "team". I told you i don't want to order from you again, so you kept my bitcoins.

    Seriously, why do people like you exist?Â  This guy is running an illegal business just to help people like us have a good time and you decide to be a little cunt. I've been lurking here for a long time and I have never, ever heard of a domestic Matrix order being intercepted by LE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your order really didn't arrive, then it would have most likely just been lost by the shitty Aus postal system. You take a risk when you place an order, don't blame the vendor.

    Foxtrot I've had an express package from AUdirect not show up to my address with a value of $200 which is far more suspicious than your standard mail situation. I know they are two totally different vendors, but I didn't go all out yelling scammer scammer scammer even when AUdirect has 25 odd transactions, which is a spec in the ocean when you compare it to ETM. He has hundreds of positive transactions (and yes you may be right, some of them may be cheap, digital goods) but for the most of it no-one has complained to the extent you have. From what I've read your total purchase was $50 of tramadol? I recall ETM recently selling LSD vials for around the $2K mark. If i was trying to selectively scam someone it definitely wouldn't be for $50, it'd be for $2k. Good reputation on this website is worth more than a couple bucks. What we are doing is not legal, WE ARE SENDING DRUGS IN THE MAIL TO OUR HOUSES. Sometimes these packages will get found. I have given AUdirect the benefit of the doubt, I'm not even asking for a refund because that will ruin my buyer stats, take a leaf out of my book and build a fucking bridge, and get over it. If we can't trust the top sellers on SR who the fuck are we supposed to trust? Don't deter newbies from buying from ETM, if anything encourage it, they will encounter smooth transactions for the most of it, with the odd anomaly like you.

    It really makes my blood boil when dickheads like you, foxtrot77, assume Police are involved because a package "hasn't" arrived. &gt;:( What an absolute load of shit! EnterTheMatrix has been a successful Aussie vendor for a long time. You won't last long on SR if you are scamming buyers and EnterTheMatrix is one vendor who would never do such a thing. Reading his posts, one could only conclude they are helpful, friendly and well respected by many other forum members, myself included. Before you post untruths on the forum and cast dispersions over ETM's vending practices, how about thinking things through and try a more diplomatic approach. I can't recall one other customer of ETM's ever complaining about his product or service so forgive me for thinking something not right here. All buyers take a risk, as do vendor's, when using SR but if something does go wrong, anyone with an attitude like yours will get no where, quickly. ???

    Foxtrot77 has officially been blacklisted in the Vendor Private forums, let's just say we are not the only seller he has tried to scam.

    99% of customers are fantastic and we will keep working harder everyday to bring you the best quality products, customer service and secure delivery.

    I've posted no "untruths". As for the "diplomatic" approach... yeah, i tired that. 10 messages worth of the diplomatic approach with ETM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He offered me a 50% bitcoin refund or a reship. I reluctantly chose the 50% refund, so he immediately updated his profile and sent me back a message saying he no longer does refunds, only 60% Matrix gift cards.

    Ten "diplomatic" PMs later i am here on the forum. Which is my right as a buyer. Leave your bias out of this, please.

    ETM is one of the most trusted and professional vendors on SR, your accusations are going to fall on deaf ears if you'll be so stupid to not even allow the possibility of a letter being misdelivered by APost. There's clearly more to what you are saying, but most of the facts point towards the conclusion that you are a fuckwit.

     Foxtrot I've had an express package from AUdirect not show up to my address with a value of $200 which is far more suspicious than your standard mail situation. I know they are two totally different vendors, but I didn't go all out yelling scammer scammer scammer even when AUdirect has 25 odd transactions, which is a spec in the ocean when you compare it to ETM. He has hundreds of positive transactions (and yes you may be right, some of them may be cheap, digital goods) but for the most of it no-one has complained to the extent you have. From what I've read your total purchase was $50 of tramadol? I recall ETM recently selling LSD vials for around the $2K mark. If i was trying to selectively scam someone it definitely wouldn't be for $50, it'd be for $2k. Good reputation on this website is worth more than a couple bucks. What we are doing is not legal, WE ARE SENDING DRUGS IN THE MAIL TO OUR HOUSES. Sometimes these packages will get found. I have given AUdirect the benefit of the doubt, I'm not even asking for a refund because that will ruin my buyer stats, take a leaf out of my book and build a fucking bridge, and get over it. If we can't trust the top sellers on SR who the fuck are we supposed to trust? Don't deter newbies from buying from ETM, if anything encourage it, they will encounter smooth transactions for the most of it, with the odd anomaly like you.

    As I mentioned in the Aussie local/os recommends page railingcapz, I checked your tracking number today and they told me it had been delivered the day after it was sent. Either someone stole it from the house or you gave me the wrong address. I gave you the tracking on friday check it for yourself. There's not a whole lot I can do when it was delivered. If oit had been seized I would have no problem refunding you, but I doubt out of 30 orders yours would be the only one to not show up. I have messaged you on SR about it. Please keep in touch.
