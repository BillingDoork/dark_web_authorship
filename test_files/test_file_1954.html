    Hello folks. I´m new here to SR. What a great place btw.  :)
    <br/>
    Tired of the crap expensive drugs you get locally. Can´t seem to find good gear here, so I was delighted to see SR.
    <br/>
    On that note I was wondering if any  Norwegians or vendors has experience ordering/shipping MDMA or ecstasy to Norway. How is the success rate given you order from a established vendor for personal use only.
    <br/>
    Seeing a few vendors don´t ship to Norway at all and reading a few topics about strict customs to scandinavia makes me a little uneasy.
    <br/>
    Need some success stories to man up   :)

    Ordered 4 or 5 packages of 1-2.5g of MDMA to Norway so far, only from trusted/popular vendors.
    <br/>
    All but one of them came, this last one just never showed up (never heard from customs either)..

    I ordered a small about of 2-cb about 7 weeks ago. Havent shoved up yet and i havent heard from the seller even though i tried to msg him 2 times.. The seller is supposed to be good so i guess its the costums.. I guess if you want to order something lsd is the easiest thing to get through. Good luck. :)

    Norway have onion layers of customs because of the low population density. Same with Sweden. Hint for this part of europe is if i doent look like a powder, sinister herb  or crystal and it doesnt smell its not a prob.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also negotiate wit vendors willing to ship to Scandinavia to do  ship smaller orders at same price

    Thanks. Just going to buy small orders for personal use and sort some friends out. No more than 10 pills at a time or a few grams of MDMA or coke. I imagine nothing would really happen if small amounts such as this would get seized?

    Customs have seized every order I ever made, 6 out of 6.
    <br/>
    Nothing gets through these day(s).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just a issue of warning.
    <br/>
    And it's a total waste of money :(
