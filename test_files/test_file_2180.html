    Mail addressed to my current residence is showing signs of having been inspected.
    <br/>
    Mail is being delivered with sticky tape resealing the back of the envelope.
    <br/>
    It's possible the glue unstuck and had to be resealed, but more than a coincidental number are being taped up?
    <br/>
    I've only 'lost' one small order. All other orders (10~) have got to me successfully.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: There is no declaration that it has been inspected, no branded tape. Just resealed envelopes.
    <br/>
    Edit: I've changed the wording of my post.

    Hey there! Thanks for the great post, in answer to your interesting question - No, you are just fine! In fact, it is actually a good sign that your mail is being open and showing signs of inspection, if not the best sign you could possibly have. You should not be concerned, and continue to order drugs from overseas, if not increase the amount you are currently importing.

    I had a letter arrive which had been opened by customs but the contents left inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It had the green customs tape on itÂ  :\

    Obiously Joosy is taking the piss and you might be flagged. Best off burning that address and ordering else ware.

    Customs, cut open my envelope and taped it back shut. A put a strip of green tape on it stating that they had inspected it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If there's no green customs tape I don't think it was them...
