    No. Tracking it using anything other than Tor would be dumb. There's no way for the tracking site to magically know you are using Tor. It would simply look like a standard Firefox Browser request from a foreign IP (Normally US, Germany or Netherlands) . Maybe you were on holiday? Nothing amazing or suspicious about that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using your normal computer and IP to track a package would be the dumbest thing ever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Based on an average for most countries, customs hold your letter for about 10 days, although this wildy varies, form the UK where I am it can be 1 day, to Russia where I've seen it be 40 days before. I've got a sneaking feeling however that Finland's customs is going to be more efficient than Russia though, if you catch my drift  ;)

    Tor connections can be noticed, a lot of the exit nodes are listed and throw flags for certain things. I always heard it was best to use a domestic VPN.

    Pretty much any established good domestic VPN will be flagged too.

    If you can't crack your neighbors wifi then using an internet cafe / starbucks is a better option.

     FINALLY!  someone who knows a thing or two about teh safety of tracking in TOR!  I have done it WELL OVER 50 TIMES!
     <br/>
     Pro tip:  Just dont track it through USPS' main site!  That's it.  period.

    You traced your packet at your house, your friends house, through tor, without it , and to top it off at a coffee shop?
    <br/>
    *facepalm*  The idea is to track the package maybe once or twice, some say never through Tor....I disagree.....regardless, use a third party tracking site, there are plenty of them out there....if anything the only flag youre going to raise is that youve tracked it to death.  I doubt your vendor gives you a refund unless its with their policy to.  Check their vendors page and if you cant find their refund policy PM them.
