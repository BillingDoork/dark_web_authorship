    Canada customs have been shown on TV some of what they find, how it was shipped and packaged.
    <br/>
    This even goes for packages being mailed out of Canada.
    <br/>
    Things that they said that they look for are:
    <br/>
    - excessive postage
    <br/>
    - Target countries know to ship contraband
    <br/>
    - They x-ray packages, in and out going.
    <br/>
    - wipe down and test for drugs
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One package being shipped to China was marked as baby formula, but was found to be cans packed with pot.

    TV show is called: Border Security: Canada’s Front Line
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (Border Security: Canada’s Front Line is based on an Australian series now in its eleventh season.
    <br/>
    The Australian version is a ratings hit and won Most Outstanding Factual Program at the Australian Television Awards in 2009.)

    +1 No kidding. Furthermore, to put it in cans means that there must have been quite the quantity being shipped.

    SO!... maybe this is why quite a few of MIMM's orders are not reaching their destination lately?  Maybe my 'conspiracy theory' that a lot of his gear is not even getting out of his own country is getting close to the truth??

    Other things that they find.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stun guns labeled as computer parts.
    <br/>
    Shipping a rice cooker from China that is packed with drugs.
    <br/>
    Gun parts shipped form the USA.
    <br/>
    Wedding invitations filled with drugs shipped from China
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Well some of them have prescriptions for it, and think that they can take their pot products with them over the border.
    <br/>
    Others are just retards. They should know that they can buy pot easily in BC. :P

    Here is the system that customs uses to scan for drugs
