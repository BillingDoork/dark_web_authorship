    Hi guys
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if domestic mails are certainly safer than international mails because of custom.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    Bingo.  They are safer, but not invincible.

    do your research on your vendor your thinking about ordering from. read the reviews on the forums and in their feedback n see if people are consistently recieving their order or if their is bad feed back about shitty stealth then maybe choose another more reputable vendor that would increase the chance for a sucesful transaction. the first couple of times youll be nervous waiting but after u see how stealth some of these orders can be youll feel more at ease. as you progress further down the road you can venture to international orders but same deal do your home work, be smart. and naturally some substances will be easier to slip under the radar than others.

    Depends on stealth, i've seen better stealth on international than some domestic, but usually domestic is safer. Also good to see you Holly, you probably haven't left, i just haven't seen a post from you in a while and i was used to seeing posts from you every where when i first started

    Domestic is inherently safer because, unless there is a blaring reason to, it doesn't typically undergo any scrutinization such as an international package does with customs.  ;D
    <br/>
    As was also posted, though, this doesn't make them invincible.

    Also, don't forget (If you live in the US) about if you use USPS it requires a warrant to open a package so you have that extra layer of security.
