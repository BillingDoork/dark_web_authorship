    Hey guys im new here. Someone tell me if this is a good idea or not?
    <br/>
    Okay so i opened a P.O and just ordered an oz of shrooms to it. I plan on using this P.O. box only to receive weed and shrooms. Never more than a couple ounces of either at a time. Is this dangerous? Do they ever get suspicious of anything like this? Or will i be fine? I guess im just a paranoid newb.

    I have one in Oz,  sometimes i get a bit jumpy on the 2 people that run it but in the quiet of downtime realize they are too bloody busy to do too much snooping, plus they have heavy penalties for postal fraud from franchisees. Might be an idea to put a little other traffic through it from time to time, maybe a newsletter etc
    <br/>
    Good luck, one of my biggest buzzes, is when i bend down to use the key and open that little door and bingo, you have just won a prize. The flip side gets a little depressing when you dream today is the day and its not, even worse when the day is actually 2wk away to touch down.

    If you live in the USA you will need to provide identification when opening a P.O. Box. SOP Post 9/11. If you can obtain a fake ID, you could conceivably open a "clean" P.O. Box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, most P.O. Boxes have a 24/7 eye in the sky watching. Just something to keep in mind.

    Just remember, if you open one with fake ID and you do get rolled, you have the drugs issue plus the Postal fraud issue, in Oz the fraud carries more weight than the drug issue. If your SR stuff is done from a memory stik then you can still claim that you have no idea where or who the stuff has come from but with the fake ID you are on camera.

    Identity fraud too.  Felony offenses that will carry hard time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not a good idea to open a PO box with fraudulent ID.  If you somehow get caught you'll be facing charges of drug possession for intent to traffic and spend A HELL OF A LOT LESS TIME IN PRISON if you're not using fraudulent ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You may even be charged as a terrorist crime since you are trying to covertly import materials to a fraudulent ID.

    i simply wouldnt do it, put it in your own name, what people fail to realise is anyone can send anything to anyone, if you get pulled up deny deny deny, if you get pulled up with the box in a fake name then even if you dont say anything you would still be done for fraud. I was going to do exactly what youre thinking, weighed out possibilities and did research.... ended up not to be worth it in the end.

    One thing to be aware of using PO boxes for OS orders in AU:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have something sent from OS using a tracking type which theoretically does NOT require a signature on delivery, it seems to be up to the discretion of the post office worker as to whether to require a signature or not, before it is logged as having arrived.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had this happen to me. Package was sent with tracking and NO SIGNATURE REQUIRED, yet I got a slip in my PO box stating that I needed to sign for the package in the post office. Scared the living piss out of me of course, but I thought it over for a few days, made a few anonymous calls to Auspost about the scenario, and decided it was more than likely an over-zealous postal worker.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the end I worked up the courage to go into the PO several days later, handed over the slip, and asked why I had to sign for something which was not supposed to require a signature. The dude just said, that's right, you don't actually have to sign for it, logged the delivery on his little hand held scanner, didn't ask me to sign anything and handed it over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All's well that end's well, but that is the one and only time I have used tracking to my PO box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise I think PO boxes are a must for the reasons already discussed here, but also because I think it just adds another layer of difficulty for any LE to actually do something about an intercepted package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I want to know, is under what legal scenarios Australia Post will divulge the identity of a PO box holder to LE?

    I think its a terrible idea to ONLY have your drugs shipped to the PO Box.  That means every single package that gets delivered to your PO box is illegal.  You need to mix in legal shit to!  Any orders from online marketplaces (legal ones) should also get sent there in my opinion.

     Why? Well, if you order i.e. Coke from a Dealer in your country: would you like him to know your real address and name? Think about it when you get ripped and you start writing real but bad things about this dealer.... would you feel safe again? He knows your name and address but you know nothing from him...
