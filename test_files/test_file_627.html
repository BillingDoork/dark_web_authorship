    USPS domestic? First Class? Priority? Overnight?
    <br/>
    UPS? Fedex?
    <br/>
    Need to specify!
    <br/>
    USPS First Class...you probably gonna be waiting a little longer. Wouldn't even go by expected delivery date. If it's in your area I'd say give it one to two more days.
    <br/>
    USPS priority. I always find that it's exactly one day later than expected delivery. At least where I'm at.
    <br/>
    Overnight 1-2 days normally.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    UPS and Fedex seem to be much more accurate and precise with their tracking, but I doubt your talking about them.

    It's USPS Priority and the expected day of delivery is today.

    I hope it comes today, but tomorrow would be okay.

    Yeah, I have such a love/hate relationship with those bastards right now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they were more efficient then they probably would catch more packages and we wouldn't get anything at all....but it sucks when you are waiting on something and are excited about it.
