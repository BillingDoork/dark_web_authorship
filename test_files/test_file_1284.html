    Like the subject says, just curious if you think it's a good idea that I place another order from a vendor with only a week give or take since I received my last order from that vendor?  Does the USPS take notice?  I mean for all they know I received the incorrect item and the company is sending me a new one.

    I'm going to assume you're ordering from a reputable vendor. They should have more than 1 return address to use. You'll be fine.

    OK thanks for the input.  Yes It's a good vendor they have a perfect rating with 300+ transactions and I had a good experience last time around.  It sounds like this doesn't raise any red flags.  I would hope this vendor uses another return address, but without asking or trying to get a 2nd package I can't be sure.  Should I ask or just go through with the order?  Will asking piss off the vendor?

    If she/he is a reputable vendor they likely switch up their return address. Personally my return address is changing every day.

    I had ordered two separate ozs of weed from a vendor before. one was placed on the 6th and the other on the 10th. they both arrived on the same day to my PO box. They both had the same city in the same state, differnet return address. I was kinda sketched out about how it looked, especially when i looked at the packages side by side and noticed they were the same boxes, and had the labels and packaging tape in the exact same places.
    <br/>
    i messaged the vendor about this but no reply, next time i will wait until one arrives before ordering again. on top of that the vendor didnt use mbbs for his oz listings and the product was only triple vacuum sealed inside the box.
    <br/>
    it got to me though but i cant help but wonder what was going thru the minds of the person who placed those two packages in my box that day.

    I don't think orders having the same packaging/label placement is an issue. I get legitimate orders all the time that arrive in identical packaging from unrelated vendors on eBay (sometimes from the same city)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't think that would be anything to raise any flags as it happens way too often. As someone who orders everything online, I can tell you that with quite a bit of certainty

    Does the OP think that the people at the post office care, or even notice, who is getting what and from where? My experience as someone who does a great deal of online shopping, is that every single person at the post office can barely do their job, nevermind snoop into who is getting what!

    Post office too busy to notice regular looking mail. Unless the envelopes are bright orange and have "Kill God" all over them you'll be okay.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, some people don't like to order more than a couple of times a month, just reduces the risk. The fewer drugs coming through your door, the smaller the risk.

    If the vendor has good delivery stats I dont see why not. Whether u get 2 "suspect" packages from different vendors or the same vendor, ur still getting packages :)
    <br/>
    and like the others have posted, I am sure u if u have relevant questions b4 purchasing then the vendors will help :)
