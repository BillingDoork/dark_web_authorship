     Jackson -
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On September 11, 2013, The Jackson Police Department’s Vice and Narcotics Division received information from a confidential source that a large quantity of illegal narcotics was being transported to the City of Jackson, Mississippi.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     These illegal drugs were being transported via U.S. Postal Service from Los Angeles, California to Jackson, Mississippi.  Once this packaged arrived to the downtown area post office, the United States Postal Inspector informed The Vice and Narcotics Unit of its arrival.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Jackson Police Department’s K-9 Unit alerted on this package.  A search warrant was generated, where 5 vacuum seal packages grams of hydro-chronic, high grade, marijuana was found in this box.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Arrested (redacted), and (redacted) for Possession of Marijuana with intent to distribute.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Police seized 8 pounds of marijuana with a street value of $25,000.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There were no federal charges were based on the weight, federal guidelines for federal prosecution must be at least a 100 pounds sent through the postal service.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is an on-going investigation with help from the United Postal Inspector.

    I have heard that the magic number for the DEA to get involved with pot shipments is ten pounds. That could be wrong, though. I just had a friend narrowly avoid a CD with a package of about five pounds (this was not SR related). A postal inspector was involved and according to one of the lawyers involved they hadn't even opened this package they still sent across the country to "see what happens" I suppose. The PI left his card at his place multiple times and also left messages trying to get them to claim this package they knew ahead of time, to be burned.

    The Postal Inspector just calls the in local PD anyhow?  (Not like State charges are a picnic)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's interesting to hear this though.  Yet I'd like to see the source memo from AG Holder confirming what the reporter wrote.

    Drugs in the USPS system are federal territory. According to a lawyer involved (after they realized what was going on) the postal inspectors' office can't even hand down this info to state/local authorities without a federal warrant (I still kinda doubt that in reality, though). Even then, they tend to handle things themselves apparently. From the information I have, the box wasn't even opened as they may not have had enough for a federal bench warrant, but decided to send it out to see who picks it up and arrest/question them. A lawyer said the box was either hit on by a dog (unlikely ?) or the sender is being watched and the package was profiled and deemed suspicious. Apparently, the return address was false, or the name was bad or not associated with the return address. Either way, it seems it was a very stupid mistake on the part of the sender, unfortunately.

    I would honestly bet money against it for that little weed, unless they really wanted to bust the recipient with something due to criminal history or the prospect of them rolling to lead to a bigger bust. Like nabbing the sender.

    Sounds like they'll let the state do the charges.

    I personally would stay within the 1 lb range.It depends on your local jurisdiction obviously...ie Oklahoma or some other state with arcane, harsh cannabis laws.However the cannabis laws are changing very fast and the Federal budget is being cut...something to think about..

    I think you can get federal charges for smugling anything illegal in the mail. The might not take the time for small amounts though.

    this made the news today.......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A mail delivery of cannabis to a Naperville home resulted in law enforcement agents seizing 15 pounds of the drug and $85,000 in cash from three suburban men Wednesday, according to authorities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The U.S. Postal Inspection Service intercepted a package sent from California to a home in the 800 block of Pueblo Court in Naperville and determined it contained 5 pounds of cannabis, according to police. Postal inspectors and police teamed up to deliver it to the home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They then saw Danial M. Waseem, 24, who lives at the residence, and Awais M. Khan, 27, of the 1900 block of Rancho Lane, Des Plaines, leave with the cannabis and make hand-to-hand transactions with buyers in Naperville-area business parking lots, according to Sgt. Lou Cammiso.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The pair allegedly drove to the 1400 block of Lily Cache Lane in Bolingbrook where another suspected drug transaction took place with resident Nickolas J. Gelardi, 18, and all three men were arrested, according to police reports.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After executing search warrants on each of their homes, officers seized more than 15 pounds of cannabis, items related to cannabis trafficking, $85,855 in cash, electronics, a 2006 BMW and a 2006 Lexus, according to police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Waseem and Khan were charged with cannabis trafficking and manufacture/delivery of cannabis and Gelardi was charged with manufacture/delivery of cannabis. They are being held at the Will County jail. Police say additional charges are pending in DuPage and Cook counties. Authorities also expect two additional people to be charged in connection with the operation.

    this is kind of hard to believe honestly, i mean 100 lbs of tree is like a fuckin ass load thatd be a huge package, plus i was always under the assumption that anything in the mail would get the feds involved. especially post 9/11 and all this junk
