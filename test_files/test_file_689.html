    A while ago, in the middle of the December I sent a letter witch Fantanyl patch inside to one of my customer. It was Xmas time, everybody knows, rush time, everything slower than usual. But in the middle of January this letter was still somewhere in the UK, so I refund 100% of money to the buyer, thinking, that it's just lost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What a supriwe was for me when I received yesterday a return of this letter wit sign REFUSED TO UNABLE TO FORWARD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A naive man I am. Lost 10 GBP,  but its not about it. It's about the trust. Which failed. Sad. A little bit.

    I'm surprised no one asked this before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did you put your real address in the envelope as sender?   :o :o
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, was the envelope returned intact?  If so, then why did you "lose 10 GBP"?

    Dude does that mean, they were able to send it back to you? Like a real return address? Are you insane?

    How did you lose 10 GBP?

    It seems your naivety here only has to do with the fact that you used your real return address.
