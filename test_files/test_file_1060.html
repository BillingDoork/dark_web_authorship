    There seems to be a theme of caution on these forums which I am 100% happy about. There is nothing more important to me than safety. Because of the hush-hush mentality, however, I have had an extremely difficult time getting on the band wagon of people using printed labels for their shipping. I have spent many, many hours researching the problems which exist and feel as if maybe I have looked too closely and overlooked the solution completely. My question is of course:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How can one print shipping labels from home (with or without tracking) anonymously?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help someone with experience in the subject could provide would be appreciated immensely. Helping me creates no risk of me hurting your business or compromising your safety. I do not vend through any online site, SR included, and am a straight up guy with a fiercely loyal and trustworthy upbringing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am willing to pay for this information (not some of the excessive prices being advertised) if need be and would like to think i'll get it one way or another eventually anyways. Why not help a brother out? It's good karma and I'd do the same for you :-)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S. Private messages are a good way to talk privately :-p
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers,
    <br/>

    I have a method I spent 3 months researching and double checking. PM me. I can buy postage online, with tracking, and make it 100% untraceable.

    Is "Printer Steganography" one of the things you are referring to? Something to be very aware of if not already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From Wikipedia:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Printer steganography is a type of steganography – "hiding data within data"[1] – produced by color printers, including Brother, Canon, Dell, Epson, HP, IBM, Konica Minolta, Kyocera, Lanier, Lexmark, Ricoh, Toshiba and Xerox brand color laser printers[2], where tiny yellow dots are added to each page. The dots are barely visible and contain encoded printer serial numbers and timestamps. Unlike many forms of steganography, the hidden information is not intended to be available from a computer file, but to allow serial number and time of printing to be determined by close examination of a printout."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd recommend purchasing a printer with cash, anonymously, maybe from Craigslist or wherever, and not letting anybody know you own said printer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd be curious to know what other issues arise with printed labels.

    If it gets to the point that LE is comparing Printer steganography and trying to match it to the printer that they have taken from you, you're already fucked. They are no longer trying to find out who mailed it, they are building a case. This means you made a different mistake.
