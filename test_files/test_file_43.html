    Skip to ******* below to fuck off my history shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just to state firstly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - I'm not a newbie to SR, been on and off for a fair while now.
    <br/>
    - just set up my forum account
    <br/>
    - I'm not a noob when it comes to stealth on the interwebs, know what to do/ what not to do as far as SR and the transaction process is concerned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *******
    <br/>
    Just wanted to set this up for Newbies to SR so that they dont fuck up my precious RockyRoad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All experienced Vendors/buyers are welcomed for their insight.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want the big boys on here to advise newbies WHAT TO DO, as far as the basics are concerned, i.e. FE, contacting vendors (or minimizing), setting up a trusted relationship with O/S vendors, starting with small amounts (1g increments), and many other topics you are aware of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want the road to last as long as possible. Education for noobs is essential in sustaining the road
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers

      alot of the aussies say "i didnt get an order" or "probobly got seized" or "4 orders out of 8 have come thru" and i often am amazed how calm they are about it because they all seem like seisures.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      im wondering how much of these substances you are getting seized?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      are you all just ordering 1 gram of coke, mdma etc? what are your product delivery weight limits that make it less of a worry if they are seized? whats the maximum amount of coke or mdma that you want tio risk getting from OS?

     509g at a time sent from the Netherlands express, 426g max sent express from china. I FE on everything. NO MORE, NO LESS. I would never run the risk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nothing gets seized EVER. 100% safe.

    Advice for n00bs 101... are you ready?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    stop posting incriminating / stupid / uninformed / previously discussed to death / AU related / annoying / SHIT!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Invest a few weeks on the forums, read EVERYTHING from PGP to bitcoin to what address to use (real name/fake name/tracking/o/s vrs domestic etc etc etc)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    WHEN you have educated yourself on forum politics and decorum and have a safe drop (not your mums house) and have some coins in your account start making some small orders to build up your stats.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chose your vendor, someone who seems legit, do not BROADCAST this to the interweb, receive your order, enjoy your drugs and repeat....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've probably missed out some important points, too smashed right now to go into the finer details... thats the basic gist....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ENJOY!
