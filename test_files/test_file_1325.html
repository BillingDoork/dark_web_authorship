    Hello fellow Silk Roaders,
    <br/>
    Got myself into a bit of a situation, hoping for some advice from those wiser than I.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'll explain what happened:
    <br/>
    I live in Ireland and regularly get cannabis shipped in, pretty much always from Canada or the States. I use this parcel forwarding company that you can sign up for with out verifying any information so you can use a fake name, fake address, DOB, has to be a real address and phone number but that's easy to sort out. I have several active accounts, one of which is attached to my real name which I usually reserve for non-illegal orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically, long story short, I made a smallish order (oz of weed from canada) but used the account attached to my real name because my other accounts were out of credits and wanted to get the order in quickly. However, I foolishly ordered using a fake name but the details of the account attached to my real name so they didn't match.. I must have been stoned, feel like such an idiot..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway it obviously raised a red flag in the parcel forwarding company and I received a call from them asking if I could verify I had indeed ordered it, looking for me to be able to match the info on the customs declaration. I obviously couldn't and my account was suspended.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would have left it at that and wrote it off as a loss due to my own carelessness but I have a new, expensive smartphone being sent to the same account but under the right name so I rang them back later to ask about what I could do to attempt to remedy this. I spoke to a young guy who after a brief discussion gave me a heads up that customs had contacted them advising them to quarantine the package (thanks dude, whoever you are). I obviously continued to deny knowledge of it, maintaining as the name wasn't mine someone must have got their order details wrong.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sorry for such a long post, I'm panicking a bit as this the first issue I've had with customs in 30+ international orders. I'm hoping they just return to the return address once no one tries to claim it and that's the end of that. They don't have my real address but my real name is pretty unique so if they tried it would probably be pretty easy to track me down if they wanted to. Anyone have some sage advice or similar experiences? Should I clean house?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks and sorry for rambling, guess I didn't really make a long story short haha

    Cant help you with Irish customs, But if your worried cleaning house is probably the best thing you can do for now, plus keep your story straight :-X. I think your pretty safe but like i said i don't know anything related to the laws in Ireland.

    I recommend that you just act like someone who'd never ordered the drugs: indignant and demanding. You're getting your account suspended (and losing a smartphone) just because some idiot you've never heard of got their mailing details wrong? How does this possibly make sense? Call the service and complain until they do something about it. "Look, I just want MY packages. You said it was a package from Canada? I don't even know anyone in Canada. If taking this other bloke's stuff will mean I'll get my phone, I'll do it, but what if it's an order of moose livers or something?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cleaning house isn't a bad idea either, although I can't imagine anyone would care that much about an oz of weed. And in the future don't order while stoned. ;)

    Not sure how strict the laws are their or the customs. Just continue to deny knowledge of the order not in your name, and as far as the cell phone, has it already been shipped? Sometimes you can log onto sites and change the shipping info of the parcel. I think thats just for FED EX AN UPS though not sure..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe call and ask for further advice about your future parcels that you have coming, ask them what will happen to your phone an other things since you account is suspended. I'm sure their is a solution to this.

    Ya, thinking with a clearer head today, I would be shocked if anything worse than a love letter came from it. It's unlikely it will even be opened, probably just sent to the bogus return address the vendor used (he's been notified of the situation).

    I actually called them complaining just like you say but the guy I spoke with said there was nothing they can do until I verify my account details and then went on to warn me that customs had advised them to quarantine the package so I just told him would go get it verified and be back. However I have no intention of giving them any more personal information if customs is onto it, I can handle having to eat 200eur. Plus they say they will hold the packages for 7 seven days and then return them to the return address,  so I'll still get the phone, just have to wait a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Gonna have to stop using the road altogether when I'm stoned I think, I just always end up ordering more weed.. Thanks for the advice anyway
