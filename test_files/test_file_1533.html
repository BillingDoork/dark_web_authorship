    Okay so I am wanting to send an old friend some LSD internationally for free (Australia to USA). I know the risk of getting caught for such an easily hidden drug is small but I am asking that someone help me come up with a good packaging plan. I've received domestically and it was great but there were no scans, Thanks for your time in advance.

    I don't think many people will share packaging techniques on here due to LE. Blotter is one of the easiest things to send. Think about it... Blotter art gets passed customs usually. How would they be able to tell just by looking at it that it's not blotter art and actually has LSD in it? It's paper. You don't need some crazy method to hide it, especially if it's a few hits. Put it in a folded piece of paper or two and ship it out in an envelope. You should be fine.
