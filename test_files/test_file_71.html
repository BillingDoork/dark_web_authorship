    If you use an experienced vendor with many transactions and good feedback on packaging the chances are very small (maybe 1-5%?).  It depends a lot in quantity/weight. If you order a few grams that can be fitted in a small letter for example its very unlikely that it will get caught. I think there are weed vendors in your country in case you haven't checked them on SR already.
    <br/>
    Ordering inside EU may be a little safer but I am not sure about that. I ve heard the customs are less serious inside EU but could be just my country's case.

    order domestically and the chance of seizure is drastically lower too.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and shipping is faster and cheaper
