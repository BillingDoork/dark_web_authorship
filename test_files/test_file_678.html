    I don't think credit cards can ever be anonymous. Now debit cards are another matter, as long as they're not true debit cards (like linked to a bank account). So we're talking about visa/mc "gift cards". But for the life of me, I can't find any info on gift cards that don't need a SS number to be activated. As for the name and address, I'm guessing you can put in anything. But if they do need SS, you're screwed. A SS number has to be associated with one name and one address, and the card companies must check this before activating.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's why it's so important that someone with deep knowledge about this answers these threads with the goods. These APC machines can only be operated with debit or credit cards, so we must find out which cards can be totally anonymous. Come on, people, help out!

    Please don't type in all caps; in spite of your HALFWAY decent grammar, it reveals you to be the middle-schooler you are.  Just kidding.  Sorry, I didn't mean to give you a compliment.  I know how all you LE are aspiring to some day have the intellect or functional reasoning skills of those in middle school.

    Also, punctuation. Use it.

    Thirdly, quite spamming the board for info.  Get off your lazy doughnut eating ass and go do your own research.  There DOES exist this incredible feature built in to this board called the search function.  Use it.  This has been covered before in the forums and we don't need this clogged up more.

    Mods, please remove this thread and ban this LE.  He's been posting in multiple threads on this topic and impatiently not waiting for an answer.  AKA spamming.

    I'm just calling it as I see it.  I saw 3 posts by you saying the same thing obnoxiously and I clicked on your profile and viewed your recent posts.  Low and behold a lot more spamming with nothing to add.  I'm not being derogatory; I'm just describing your behavior and drawing parallels between that and common LE tactics.  I'm sorry their so congruent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One way or another I hope your day gets better! God Bless!
