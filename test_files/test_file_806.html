    So ive made alot of domestic purchases and have had one canadian purchase (int.) for some mushrooms. ive been eyeing up all the exotic hashs up for offer from countrys like South africa, Spain,Uk, portugal and others at bulk prices MUCH better than anything on this side of the pond. I didnt include the Netherlands for obvious security reasons.
    <br/>
    Anyone from the US have a reccomended vendor for high% of gettin hash here. i would love a bunch of Tmax or some of Emeralds Culero or who know. ive just been paranoid about pulling the trigger, ive never gotten any knocks or love notes and would love to keep it that way

    spanishflys pakistani is very good hash and would sell nicely in the US, right alongside with standard bubble hash commonly found in US..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    .as for the TMAX, I got a 50 g brick of pollen hash from worldshipping. It is very nice to smoke with weed, but the hash just by itself is just not as potent as most hash in US and a lot of weed, just because of the way it is made in Morocco. Still an amazing price and I sold it fairly easily here just for cheaper than the local market price.

    I got some hash in recently from Emerald it was 10 grams of TMAX. I didn't think it was too bad for the price i paid (120 dollars for 10 grams)

    I got TMAX hash from emerald. Was pretty good quality (especially for what i paid). But not sure if he still has any in stock, when I went to reorder he didnt have any listed :(
    <br/>
    But if your in the United States and your looking for TOP TOP quality stuff I would recommend bubble hash from a domestic guy (dont remember his name offhand). its  more expensive than hash from europe but damn i heard that hash was good!! And plus its a domestic order so much less chance of dealing with seizures.

    Make sure it's in a moisture barrier bag or two.... vacuum sealing ten times won't do it.  See the sticky at the top of the Shipping section for more information.

    The Ali Baba is actually really nice for the price (got hlf a bird so for $3 a gram its pretty unbeatable) and especially if you're reselling to the old heads cause it reminds them of the Moroccan they used to get in the day so they ate that shit up lol I let it go for 15 - 20 a g for my soso customers and 10-12 for my bulk/friends so all in all it worked out nicely...stealth could have been better but this was a bit back before the MBB threads were created.Also the ali baba is as hard as a rock so it was the perfect consistency to smoke pure has joints and cigarillos, we fit like 8 or 9 gs into a swisher and I swear it was sweeter than candy or something.

    A "bird" is slang for a kilo of cocaine.
