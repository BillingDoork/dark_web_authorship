    I don't see anybody who does a good job selling lsd in USA so I'm thinking I'll have to resort to other countries.

    I get stuff shipped to a  PO box. Should I do it or not? I just want 2-5 tabs. Is it safe? Does it get checked? Will I need to sign?

    2-5 tabs is probably really safe, considering it's just paper/cardboard. Stealth factor is high already, and the vendor could perhaps hide the blotters in regular looking mail. I'm sure the LSD vendors here are good with stealth, especially international.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You may want to consider that the LSD may degrade during transit though. International mail may be put in cargo, which has little protection from heat and air. I ordered once from the Netherlands, and the tabs lost about 30% of its advertised strength (100 instead of 150). That is my own opinion however, and may not be what actually happened.

    you have more chance of santa falling through your chimney than having to worry about 5 - 10 hits of LSD.

    Its on paper, it wont scan up, dogs wont smell it.

    Hey now that's not really needed, you were new here at some point also dude.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said they're right -- you've got little to worry about if it's a personal amount. Even larger amounts I wouldn't really think are much of an issue if the vendor knows his stuff.

    Being from the US as well, I too thought about that. However, if you're not really in a rush, I'd suggest waiting for a reputable US vendor. Not only is it [slightly] safer, but it will likely lead to a hell of a lot less paranoia on your side. I know there are none now, but someone WILL come up if you check every so often. Just have your bitcoins ready to go.

    Rocker is US and claims to be getting acid in soon. His shrooms are the best I've ever had, and he's a top notch vendor. Give him a look.
