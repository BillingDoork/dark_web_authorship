    So this is a perfect mailbox to use but since there is no name at the apartment # I should first start getting some mail to that address right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was thinking maybe some free magazine subscriptions in a random name? Not too sure...just dont want packages not showing up do to no name listed ... any ideas?

    Bad idea, dont do it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Its wrong for so many reasons, and will raise redflags like Russia CA. 1950
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use your home addy, real name, and you will be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you musst use another addy, use a legit one, with consent of the residence occupants.

    how is this a bad idea? anything i order will be small enough to be placed in the mailbox # coordinating with the apartment #. i had the locks changed for the box and i alone have the key.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i just need some sort of mail to arrive there beforehand so the mailman wont be weird.

    Do as you wish my friend. Just letting you know the general consensus of a long time buyer... Also, hit the search engine, there was a ex postal inspector employee that made a thread answering any and all mailing questions. One thing he made very clear, was to always use legit names and addys. Good luck

    hes right!! dont do it! or at least i wouldnt! always better to use a legit establlished addy.
    <br/>
    especially if it small amounts!!! large amounts maybe a different recipe. but thats the stuff
    <br/>
    that gets you a roomate you DONT want!! but like dirty said do as u wish....
