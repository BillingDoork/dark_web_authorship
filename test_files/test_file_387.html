    Domestic order for small quantity of adderall was slated to arrive today via USPS priority. As of around 9am the DCN is saying "Undeliverable as addressed." I'm damn sure that I didn't mess up the address I sent the vendor, whom I've transacted with before and likewise doubt screwed up. Given the responses via searching these forums ranges from "you're fucked" to "it's probably no big deal," does anyone else have any further experiences to share regarding this? Calling them would remove plausible deniability on my part but letting them return to sender will probably result in them sending it to this hell pit in Georgia I've read all about where they apparently open the contents... any more experiences to draw from would be helpful, thanks.

    Haven't had this experience myself but my guess is you're out of luck.  Wait another couple days the maybe see if the vendor will give you a partial refund.  I wouldn't call after the package.  Just my opinion though.

    Had this happen with a Buyer who did not use their real name.  If you live in an apartment, sometimes the mailman will keep your name taped to the inside or the back of your mailbox.  If you don't use your real name, they might determine that it was sent to the wrong address.
    <br/>
    Had this happen to me years ago when I moved to a new apartment.  The mailman had never updated my name on the box, so when a new mailman took over the route, he didn't know I lived there and rejected some of my mail.  Or at least that is the bullshit answer the PO gave me

    Undeliverable as Addressed is not good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had a handful of items get this prior to switching to computer labels and none ended up making it to the recipients hands. They return to sender. I assume the return addy is bogus though, so you are probably out of luck..

    Thanks for replying everyone. I didn't pull any of that paranoid crap when I ordered... The name wasn't a fake &amp; matched what was on the box so I'm chalking it up to a USPS holiday/dumbass mistake or they somehow identified the substance. I'm working with the seller to resolve this and will update if drones start descending upon my apartment or anything interesting happens.

    Most the time a "undeliverable as addressed"  means just that!  So on your end, or the vendors end didn't get something right with the address . . .  possibly a wrong name, but usually if it is a bogus name &amp; they choose to not deliver it, it will  or may say on the DCN info "out for delivery" and then it will say undeliverable.  So it depends on what all the info that was on the DCN.  If the address was wrong, it can still get to the proper Post Office, but will not get out to be delivered, it will get tagged &amp; returned from there.

    Happened to me once. The USPS wasnt aware of the contents so I called the USPS local office and said hey this is my tracking number and can you please deliver it with my regular mail. They will. i waasnt worried at all but can completely understand if you dont want to call them and say wyf? I once had a package go all the way to Hawaii by mistake and yes I seen that and thought WTF and called my USPS guy and he got it to me.lol Just hang in there.

    Well it's up to you on what you want to do but if I were in your shoes and it being a small quantity and all...I would give them a call and tell them the situation and ask if they can somehow reroute it back so it gets delivered.

    I decided to let USPS "sort" this out itself and, lo and behold, package arrived today, exactly 1 week after ordering it and 5 days after being marked undeliverable. My advice to anyone else who receives an undeliverable DCN status and how I'll handle it going forward is to either contact them or wait it out depending on the size of the order and who the vendor is. Thanks for the help everyone!
