    Ordered LSD 5 times from two NL vendors : 1 from Flying Dutchman which didn't arrived, 4 from FartBomber which 3 of them arrived successfully and 1 on it's way, hope it'll arrive be'ezrat hashem  ;)     From the 3 successful orders, 1 arrived within 3 days, one arrived within 2 weeks and one arrived within 5 days. The shipping times change due to hundred of reasons and delays in the worldwide delivery services and the local post offices.

    I'm quite concerned about ordering other drugs than L, I think we have tough customs and don't wanna deal with them...

    I know we have probably the best customs in the world in the weapon smuggling department but much more relaxed about drugs then you'd expect, also I read here on the forum a while back that you can't send fluids to Israel but don't take my word for it.

    I realise HAMAS are fucked, but really, do you guys have to start WW3 by inciting Iran to backup your actions against the Palestinians?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You Jews need to stop playing on your WW2 sympathy vote because people aren't buying it anymore (except the ones you've actually bought) and you fail to see that you're both equal glimpses of the same untruth and you primitive tribalism will most likely destroy Israel/Palestine!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Both sides are guilty of barbarism (let us not forget the Amalikites for example) and we are living in the year 2012 FFS!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why don't you bring them into the nation, constitutionally outlaw HAMAS's fascism (Zionism is fascism too) and setup a Libertarian state?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why the fuck you Jews need to take other peoples land the way you do and bombing women and children with white phosphorous makes one question if you learned anything from your treatment and the hands of the Europeans. Have you ever wondered why they and every other nation have treated you this way? Take a look at what you've done to the people who were there first (and don't give me that God gave it to us because we're a "chosen race") racist bullshit either.

    First of all dude, if you wanna start a discussion about this subject, open a new thread in the off topic forums, and I'll be glad to argue with you all day long OK?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Second, why do you just start attacking &amp; slandering us suddenly, throwing lots of information you probably heard from your pro-Hamas media in your country. What do you want from us? we're just normal drug users in SR community like you!  For that, you get -1 from me, because you are not nice!  &gt;:(  I'll argue with you only if you're about to listen and not just throwing tons of words...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Third, stop thinking that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just black &amp; white, and so easy to solve. It's way more complex than you think!!

    I'm not going to start a thread on ISRAEL VS PALESTINE POLL: WHO WILL WIN?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You guys have superpower weaponry, they have dog shit slightly better than slingshots!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was asking out of curiosity and let me assure you, Australian media is not pro anything they're retarded!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You and I both know God's not a real estate agent and if he were, why in the fuck would he give you the only part of the Middle East with no oil? Kind of a big oversight don't you think?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOTICE I SAID HAMAS ARE FUCKED? They imprison women for 6 years for having a child out of wedlock FFS and the absolute last thing I want to see is the establishment again of the Caliphate. I also wish Iran to be free of Islamic Fundamentalist Jihadists too. I have no time for them, they are an enemy of civilization and need eradicating, no doubt. But you could prevent all this by bringing them into the state and having a democratic constitution that prevents their human rights abuses (which the Zionists are also guilty of too and you know it) and if South Africa was bad then WTF is Likud's excuse?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But you can't deny you've dehumanized these people (at least the State has) and these crazy settlers on the West Bank are in violation of international law.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your State is making it impossible for these people to live and forcing them into giant ghetto's to starve while soldiers and giant gates mark the entrance (sound familiar?) and you wonder why they commit the acts of desperate people. Remember when you Jews had the Warsaw uprising, how is their actions any different ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ON THEIR LAND it's not even close to Germans doing shit in what's their country and always has been.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I both know we "Goyim" aren't equal in the eyes of Israelis, according to Talmudic teachings they force into your youth at a young age to see any Gentile as a lesser beings, but the ramblings of primitive nomadic herdsmen doesn't make fact.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm curious how you think this invasion is going to change anything and why you don't just take Gaza and bring them into the State, but set the Constitution so they can't follow their teachings the way they do (and let's not forget how fucked up old testament laws are and how equally oppressive they were) and in a sense, free them from bondage while at the same time free yourselves from fear of reprisals?

    If it weren't for the German Government working with the Zionist Congress there would be no Israel, and as for the Gas Chamber Extermination Program... that's an unfortunate war propaganda myth that has been held over the heads of Germans and Europeans alike for way too long.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many died from starvation and diseases especially typhus (known as the thinning disease) and dysentry toward the end of the war, and many were treated poorly no doubt but as far as Auschwitz being a gas chamber extermination centre, that's false.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People must remember at the end of the war the allies had destroyed all the infrastructure and Germans couldn't even feed themselves let alone POW's and every nation from Australia to America imprisoned it's own citizens and potential enemies of the state so it was common practice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I suggest you read the Leuchter Report by Dr Frederick Leuchter, who was (and still is) the head designer of gas chambers for world governments as well as the video's by Jewish historian David Cole for start.

     I realise HAMAS are fucked, but really, do you guys have to start WW3 by inciting Iran to backup your actions against the Palestinians?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You Jews need to stop playing on your WW2 sympathy vote because people aren't buying it anymore (except the ones you've actually bought) and you fail to see that you're both equal glimpses of the same untruth and you primitive tribalism will most likely destroy Israel/Palestine!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both sides are guilty of barbarism (let us not forget the Amalikites for example) and we are living in the year 2012 FFS!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Why don't you bring them into the nation, constitutionally outlaw HAMAS's fascism (Zionism is fascism too) and setup a Libertarian state?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Why the fuck you Jews need to take other peoples land the way you do and bombing women and children with white phosphorous makes one question if you learned anything from your treatment and the hands of the Europeans. Have you ever wondered why they and every other nation have treated you this way? Take a look at what you've done to the people who were there first (and don't give me that God gave it to us because we're a "chosen race") racist bullshit either.

      Ordered LSD 5 times from two NL vendors : 1 from Flying Dutchman which didn't arrived, 4 from FartBomber which 3 of them arrived successfully and 1 on it's way, hope it'll arrive be'ezrat hashem  ;)     From the 3 successful orders, 1 arrived within 3 days, one arrived within 2 weeks and one arrived within 5 days. The shipping times change due to hundred of reasons and delays in the worldwide delivery services and the local post offices.

    Dude, good to see you´re well informed and doing what you think is fair to help the people. But the guy just wants some acid. Just because he lives in Israel dosent mean he can change or agree with what is going on there.. Besides have you seen some of those Israeli girls? OMG they are so fit. Peace and love... If you wanna scream at someone join a protest.

    People like you are the reason all conflicts go on in the world. You can´t separate the people from the state. I can imagine you with a towel wrapped around your head screaming Allahu Akbar.. Shame the gear you buy on here hasn't opened your mind up a bit, might need to take a crow bar to it next time.

    dude you're wrong

    I'm not bragging or anything, but security is actually a pain in the ass as any tourist would tell you
    <br/>
    <br/>
    plus, Israel is one of the leading countries in tech &amp; arms... they do have some funky machines they use at the airport, things you don't even find at JFK... not to say it's a good thing, because again it's just a fucking pain in the ass you having to head to the airport 4 hours before your flight just to go through security!

    Sorry, let me re-phrase what i meant,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    POLICE in Israel are about 50 years behind as it comes to technology i will be surprised if anyone there even knows how to install TOR browser!     (not all LE in Israel as you are correct when it comes to inbound security matters)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    for this i can vouch, having dealt with them quite too many times unfortunately and they are fucking stupid unless you are one of the "most wanted" criminals  :)
