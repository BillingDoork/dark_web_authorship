    So I had some friends over for the weekend, and we ordered some stuff from SR (expecting it to arrive Thursday/Friday), and it still hasn't arrived. A package (7g weed) was for one of my friends and to save him driving back up to mine (~3 hour round trip) I was wondering whether it'd be safe enough just to stick the package back in the post when it arrives? I was considering cutting off the label with my name on it and sticking a bigger label on top with his address, so you can't see that the other one has been removed and simply putting another stamp on top of the previous stamp that was used.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would this work? Or will the package be caught as it may look like it's been tampered with? Shall I just buy a new padded envelope?

    Why dont you wait till it arrivses, so you can see the condition of the package and how it was packed, before sticking it back in the post.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or repack it yourself. then resend it

    Unless it has been packaged to exceptional standards you should repack it per the guideline on stealth shipping. Most of the weed i have ordered on SR is not up to those standards and within the time you are talking about smell would be permeating the packing material. Only one weed vendor i have used went the distance. Good luck

    Yeah the smell was one thing I was worried about - especially now that its coming up to 6 days :/ Thanks guys, if he can't come and collect it I'll repackage it and send it on its way.
