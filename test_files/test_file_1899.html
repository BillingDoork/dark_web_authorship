    Okay, so my neighbor has been deceased for a couple months now and my mom actually owns the house now cuz he left it to her in his will cuz she always took care of him etc. My question is do you think it would be safe to get products from here shipped there? I only ask this because he still gets mail daily, which I think is weird. Thanks

    Be very cautious if the package is addressed to someone who is not a current resident of the household, in that they regularly receive mail to that house.  If it's a deceased person who still receives mail there, that should be fine.

    <br/>
    USPS often chooses to not deliver a package that is addressed to someone they do not know as a current resident of the household.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other than that, just exercise a special amount of caution.

    Okay cool. I know the guys name who is deceased and he was the only person that ever lived there and no one lives there currently, there is just mail getting sent there in his name daily. I know this cuz my mom checks him mail everyday. I am wanting to order some bulk stuff too, so hopefully they wont require a signature  :o

    Don't trust any seller who requires you to sign for drugs.  If you're doubtful, message a seller and ask if they use signature confirmation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just remember: if you're going to do this, use an extreme level of caution.

    If your mom is the one checking the mail, you are likely to have trouble getting your packages before she does. Unless she is aces with you buying drugs from the internet, which I doubt since current evidence suggests you are under 18, this is a terrible plan.

    Then again, if you are under 18, buying drugs from the internet is a terrible plan already.

    I'm 20 years old... almost 21  ;D I'm just living at home until I find a job cuz I just graduated college in May 2012. Anyways enough of that... I would be getting to the mail before my mom because she works till like 4:30pm everyday and the mail comes around noon everyday here. I'm still a little sketched out about doing it though.

    PO employees are not idiots, often they know the gossip around localities and probably know what's up, there may even be a forwarding address in play to a relative.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use YOUR name, at YOUR address, where mail comes to you already.  If you get to the mail first every day, it shouldn't matter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're looking to throw up red flags, put a dead person's name on an envelope and have it delivered.  It's worth mentioning that OPENING MAIL ADDRESSED TO SOMEONE ELSE IS A FELONY FEDERAL CRIME.  So in terms of WORST CASE for sending to yourself, vs the same for picking up someone elses' mail... only one of those are worth the risk in my opinion.

    Yes, generally the USPS mailman/lady knows what's up in the neighborhood after having the same route for a while... also mail forwarding services are usually done very quick.  I would suggest having a test letter mailed before using a dead man as a scapegoat for your narcotics.   8)

    If it were my dead relative, I'd have a forwarding address put in right away (electric bills etc!) otherwise who is paying the utilities etc?  A test letter is a good suggestion if you're really intent on doing it (still not my first choice of method), you'll at least know if it comes through.  Would be a shame to order something good and have it arrive in unfriendly hands.
