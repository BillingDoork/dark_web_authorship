    Hey,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Multiple items from multiple venders have not arrived. I have not received a letter from the postal service saying they were taken, nor have I been contacted by the police. Any idea what is up with my disappearing packages?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    edit: even more oddly, I just realized that everything I have purchased recently has been legal! Shisha, cigars, and some legal RCs, and yet none of them have arrived! odd....

    Well the items were sent from multiple venders, all of which have been around for a while and have a good rating. Maybe just bad luck. The RCs I only ordered a week and a half ago, so there is still hope they will come. The tobacco products though were ordered months ago and 3 weeks ago respectively, so I highly doubt either of those are going to show up.

    I'm not sure what this guy is on, but I think I want some  :). Anyway, if your orders were domestic and they have taken that long, they probably aren't going to show up. If they were international, just sit back and wait, they could still show up, the postal system is crazy busy this time of year. If nothing shows up, you should use a different mailing address.
