    Long time lurker, first post...(and from an anonymous account)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have successfully mailed my products for years, using USPS, to friends and family. But, after reading this forum, I need to make my shipping even more secure.  Walking into a post office is no longer an option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have been preparing myself to become a seller on SR for the last month.  I have one more hurtle to jump, how to acquire CORRECT postage for my first class mail?  Stamps look odd, so I think I need a postage meter.  But, how do I get a postage meter that is NOT linked to me or a bank account linked to me?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe I am just being paranoid, but I want no connection to the package including a meter number on a postage meter stamp.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Help!

    You can always mail packages from Fedex Office,UPS store,MailBoxes Etc. They all take cash also you can use the APC machine inside most Post Offices and you can even use it after hours. If cameras are a concern nothing a hat won't cover up.

    That's easy to do, When you order it online just use a bogus name and SS# or you goto most stores and gas stations sell those pre-paid visa and american express cards that are pre-loaded with $25-$100 the you don't need any information at all

    Yeah theoritcally though  (to those who wear Mister Dank style tinfoil hats).....this *could* be traceable.....if they traced the card back to the gas station pulled the camera etc.....Doubt this would EVER happen for a medium style vendor or even a large one at that though....agreed a good idea..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another option is to buy a sheet of them from hatter26 (He sells priority/.45s/18.95's/and others in sheets for bitcoins.....If you wear some serious tinfoil that would be THE best way to anonymously buy stamps, just maybe not the most affordable....

    Missed the meter piece here...I apologize...Yeah that would seem like a bad way to go....I have shipped more or less EVERY package of pills with flat rate envelopes and stamps.  I use a 5.15 priority stamp, and stick 2 .45 forevers next to it to cover the charge for the DCN.....drop box at a blue box THAT IS NOT near a CCTV camera to the best of your knowledge....  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to know for sure.....there is equipment that you can buy online that scans for cameras ....that may be worth an investment and is something I'm looking at for purchase.  Good luck though, you'll be just fine if you keep up this attitude....you cant stand to lose from covering yourself as best as possible and exploring all your options.
    <br/>
    Peace

    *****IGNORE THIS DUMBASS IDEA OF MINE....One morning I had to go get materials and was looking on the USPS website through Tor and saw that you could have such items dropped off for free, I have raging social anxt so I liked the idea and never thought about how a bundle of DCNS could be tracked if one of them got picked off or they were just suspect in general....I mean I would never have it ordered to my name or my address but still, bad thinking on my part and thanks for pointing it out.....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are (EDIT) BAD DUMB &amp; LAZY options other than going directly into the post office for obtaining flat rate envelopes and/or boxes.  USPS will deliver shitloads of them to you....or a friend, or friend of a friend....My BAD!

    Go to an automated postal center APC, preferably one where there are no cameras. You can purchase postage from the APC using a prepaid gift card. Thats as anonymous as it gets unless you send first class envelopes with regular stamps on them.

    if its just stamps your talikng about buying, dont get them in the post office, many supper markets and drug stores sell them

    if its priority stamps you want, just take a long trip away from anywhere you might be recognized, 5 miles away to a Post Office and buy $100 work of priority stamps

    Pick up your postage from various post offices, pay with cash. Never pick up ridiculous amounts at one time. Liquid bandaid will keep your fingerprints off of priority packaging and DCN stickers when you grab them while also not attracting attention like gloves.

    Also grab some of each stack from each post office you go to that way the batches get mixed up. people have said that the post office can flag an entire batch of DCNs. While I do not think that is as easy to do as some people think it is if the post office finds a decent sized package they will go through the effort to do it.

     Stay safe,

    Hi. Here is my tentative plan, please tell me if you see any holes in it:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Use spendbitcoins to fund a paypal account (which has a fake name and address) with previously acquired and tumbled bitcoins.
    <br/>
    (are there alternatives to spendbitcoins that would be better for any reason?)
    <br/>
    2. Use that paypal account to buy postage from stamps.com (again using fake info), where it seems you can print USPS stamps instead of entire shipping labels;
    <br/>
    (or pick another similar service: www.usps.com/business/online-postage.htm)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My concern is that creating an account on stamps.com with a fake address might get it flagged, in which case they might either close your account or track the stamps you purchased (you could always use a real 'fake' address, but they send you a kit of freebies which I'm guessing shouldn't be returned to sender).
    <br/>
    Does anyone think this is a real issue, or that it would be safe? If it's a problem, you could set up a shipping proxy in the same manner as if you were buying drugs from SR (which I unfortunately haven't done yet) in order to receive their free starter kit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure if you can buy from stamps.com over tor, but I hope so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other problems? I'm planning to start selling and I want to be sure I'm not sending out any dirty postage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace

    Sounds like a bad idea to me. Also I'm pretty sure paypal doesn't allow tor (I'm not going to take the risk to find out) so you would have to get a VPN. And if one of your packages gets searched than the entire batch will be flagged.

    paypal, or greendot won't work for online postage unless you have a stolen ID. to register ANY of these the last name, DOB and SS# are checked against a database.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    gift cards won't work online either since they aren't verified. I tried
    <br/>
    <br/>
    only way I could find to print postage at home was to assume an ID and set up accounts with it at greendot or/and PayPal and USPS. also, if you get verified by greendot and get the mail from the anonymous address you use, once you get the new card you can set it up for use at ATM's. VERY handy when selling BTC for MoneyPak
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just picked an abandoned/foreclosed house nearby. sent a couple test letters to make sure that they would deliver with the name to that address, then ordered my card!!

    Thanks for the insights.

    I guess I had missed the lesson that stamps (even the 5.15) have no serial number or individual identification (correct me if I'm wrong), so only the DCN stickers are an issue. I assume the flat rate boxes do have serial numbers though, right? Sorry if this has been covered.

    Boxes and envelopes aren't tracked as far as I know. They just have a UPC. I mean they are free and with the volume of flat rate envelopes and boxes they give out there is no way they would keep track of every single one.
