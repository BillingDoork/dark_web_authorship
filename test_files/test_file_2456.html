    I've been considering the viability of a legal anonymous mail consignment service in the US. Existing mail services (Mailbox etc.) fall under CMRA postal regulations-- to receive mail FOR someone, by law, they have to have 2 forms of identification on file.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This would be different-- a hybrid of a couple services:
    <br/>
    1) Amazon Locker (http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200689010)
    <br/>
    2) Gumroad (http://gumroad.com)
    <br/>
    3) Redbox
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The service is very simple. A seller would receive two tracking codes from the BitLocker website (or API). One code goes on the package and the other is for tracking/pickup. The shipper also submits the item's price and how they want to receive funds (ACH or BTC). They ship the item to a published mailing address and package ends up in the BitLocker (ala Amazon Locker) -- anyone with a pickup code punches it into the vending machine, pays the required amount with their credit card (or prepay with BTC). The package drops and funds are remitted to the seller.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With storefronts being so expensive to operate this would allow any merchant to open a "scaleable storefront" with minimal inventory in hundreds of cities. Think about the last time you needed a USB cable RIGHT NOW-- $20 bucks at Walmart. With this new storefront a vendor ship items straight from China and customers get unbeatable prices.
    <br/>

    Thoughts?
