    I was reading the internet today an was looking at the newspaper from where I grew up. I noticed a name in the headlines. The aged matched too...yep it was def this guy I went to jr high/ high school with. Got a CD on him for 3 kilos....I am nosy an want to know wtf went wrong....did he sign??is he a member here?? I just cant call him up after 15years an says "this is so an so remember me from chemistry class....i sat behind you.?.?"
    <br/>
    All the paper said was postal inspectors had reason to believe the package was suspicious...which meet one of the guidelines. Postal inspector call local L/E....thought feds would do this???? Local L/E do a CD an all paper said was after he accepted the package they arrested him...Not if he signed. How much trouble do you all think he in? Do you all think he signed...im thinking that. When im waiting on a package I never open door I just let the nice mail man sit it on my porch if its to big to fit in my mail box.

    Whatever the laws are for that state I'd imagine.  3 keys could turn federal, though they are busy with bigger criminals.

    Sending over 3 lbs of weed in one package does not seem that intelligent.  As far as I'm aware most vendors ship pounds in multiple packages spaced out.  I'm sure it's possible to get 3 lbs in one package through the mail, but it's a pointless risk since if all of the weed is in one package, you'll be prosecuted for all of it, instead of possibly just a QP or so aswell.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I think 3 pounds is a felony in the vast majority of states.

    It really doesn't matter if he signed or not.  He probably triggered an event for a warrant and the search probably showed he's in the drug trade.  If so then he'll likely be in jail for a long time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You might give him a call and offer your thoughts/support.  I has to suck getting caught in a trafficking situation.

    Good catch lol, I don't know why the hell I thought 1 kilo = 1lb instead of 2.2.  Sending 6.6lbs in one package is even more ridiculous though!
