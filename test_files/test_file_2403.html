    Hi everyone...I guess the prudent thing to say before I get into it is that sorry if this has been posted before. If so, I'd appreciate it if someone pointed me to the appropriate thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I have been reading about LSD deals thruout the forum and have gotten invaluable information on vendors, tab doses, etc. but have not come up with anything related to the physical form of the packaging of LSD. More than likely the tab(s) would be mailed using a normal envelope since LSD is odorless, etc. but I wanted definitive information on this before I bought any.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would be really grateful if you guys could help me out on this one-especially/hopefully those that have bought LSD from SR before and LSD vendors themselves.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks a lot...

    Are you buying international or domestic? What country do you live in? Usually the vendor states whether it's first class/priority/express and or lettermail. Every vendor has their own ways.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's exceptionally easy to ship LSD. We can't get into in depth detail about packaging as their is LE creeping these forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Picture air mail is perfect for LSD, if not a professional business oriented lettermail. USPS hubs and locations usually have manilla envelopes that contain 2 pieces of cardboard for shipping pictures that can't be damaged or bent. Very easy to stick sheets in between the 2 pieces of cardboard in tinfoil stealthshipped further with your own twists.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The cardboard would insure none of the tabs are bent or damaged.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you buy LSD from a reputable vendor here you will have very little to worry about. LSD is very easy to slip through the cracks due to it blending in flawlessly with legal mail.

    Thanks for the informative reply synikal...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, I live in an Eastern European country, to answer one of your questions...and what I gather from your reply is that yes, LSD is sent in an average envelope so that's good (although your reply focuses on LSD sent from the US). Even so, regardless of origin, a normal, business-type envelope would do it I think.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But since I am less than zero about this (sending LSD thru mail), it really matters not too much what I think, but what experienced others think so again, thanks for the input.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS. Have you ever sent or been sent LSD via mail before?

    Yes. I have received LSD from the European union via letter mail. It came as a business oriented letter, and looked so much like normal mail that if I had not known that I was in fact receiving lucy from Europe there's a damn good chance it would've went right into the junk mail that I never open.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've also ordered LSD domestically in the states, and it came in a priority 12 1/2" x 9 1/2 padded envelope, stealth shipped of course.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hopefully that cleared up any questions you have, and like I said lucy is VERY easy to slip through the cracks whether you choose the letter mail or express air mail option (going off what the Europeans call it :P)

    But I did you see...I even read the whole 24 pages of the LSD Avengers thread as it were. To be honest, if some people think I am asking stupid/simple questions _now_, I wonder what they will think when I start asking about GPG usage.

     I've also ordered LSD domestically in the states, and it came in a priority 12 1/2" x 9 1/2 padded envelope, stealth shipped of course.

     Hopefully that cleared up any questions you have, and like I said lucy is VERY easy to slip through the cracks whether you choose the letter mail or express air mail option (going off what the Europeans call it :P)

    Ignore the people here that aren't helping or benefiting you. You posted a reasonable question about LSD packaging in the correct forums, so they don't have much room to speak. We were all once noobs.

    <br/>
    As for gpg (it's actually called PGP!) read below!

    <br/>
    <br/>
    THEN once you figure out the ins of PGP you can to here to ensure you have everything correct! You can essentially post your encrypted message to pine via his thread below to ensure you've done everything correctly. This link follows below.
