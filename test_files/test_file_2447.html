    What's the advice re checking Auspost express post tracking with Tor? I've read somewhere that checking tracking with Tor can flag the item but wasn't sure if that relates to Auspost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was expecting a delivery today which hasn't shown so may need to check the tracking number later, not too concerned at this point in time as I know next day delivery can sometimes get delayed by a day, however this is still the first next day I've not had arrive on time though so it has got me a bit worried.

    i would not check tracking for a couple days after you 'think' you should have received.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and no, you should not check tracking with TOR. even if it is auspost.. worth taking that chance?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    use a derka derka proxy, or goto cameraless internet cafe

    never had a problem. but you should use one of those package tracker websites they have if there is one available for AUS. Saying that i have never had a problem checking with Tor for either domestic or International. Remember Tor is run by a network of volunteers so its not only known US military IP's that come up as the exit IP it could be some 4channer in his mums basement that only setup his exit node 2 hours ago.

    benny, i dont know why the fuck you would use TOR. might aswell scream im dodgy. and no i dont know FOR SURE auspost will redflag it, but why the fuck would you even chance it.
    <br/>
    lets be honest, unless your in the comp sec industry, or some shady fucker, you would be using clearnet.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    why would you try hide your IP address when checking a tracking number, that is addressed to your house......................................unless your a dodgy meth shelving mofo.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    maybe im just weird..

     Seems like we could really easily throw off this whole "never use tor to check tracking" by exclusively using tor to check the tracking of all of our non-SR related mail. Obviously it would take a lot of volume, but there has to be a breaking point where scrutinizing tracked packages checked with tor stops being viable if they waste x amount of time on innocent mail.

    Refer to the thread where the bloke proposes to spray hash oil all over money and letterboxes causing so many false positives that drug dogs become obsolete. The sooner this is implemented en mass the better. The thread gives a full step by step guide with explanations of how the oil gets on EVERYTHING.

    I use Tor shiz because I like my plausible deniability, and if they Log IP's for Tor then you can bet they Log all IP's. Plus I cant exactly take my cracky down to my nearest internet cafe and have a puff while im checking when my restock is arriving can I? I beleive its nothing more then a myth. Auspost dont have the resources and anybody that knows anything about Tor, Crypto, BTC etc seems to be for the most part very liberal and on our side, not to mention that the Tor Exit nodes (Logged IP) are run by a network of volunteers and could as just as much be some kids computer in his parents basement as an NSA server.

    mate, you can still stay at home and twirl your pipe and not use tor. just use a north korean proxy or from some other derka derka.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    while im sure they dont have the resources to keep 24/7 tabs on it..    is it worth the risk?    not to mention, they would log the ip's of anything tracking.
    <br/>
    so if you were sloppy, and pigs did decide to gather more evidence for your case on importing an oz of fine meth... (you greedy bastard)     they would goto auspost and request any and all info in relation to whatever express post tracking number... should the LE have intercepted a package or whatever..  sure there are a millions of different variables.......
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do you wash your btc, or bounce from a couple of wallets..... then why not take that one extra step...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you wont be so lucky next time to get just an $800 fine for your 4grams ;)           maybe i just value my watertight arse more than you ;)   hehe

    google proxy servers. there are millions. just choose a country like that, and no-one can do much. just dont use hidemyass.

    i like eastern european countries.

    the only difference is the proxy probably wont be flagged as dodgy, which most TOR exit nodes are.

    however, how strange is it someone from north korea checking their auspost tracking haha.
