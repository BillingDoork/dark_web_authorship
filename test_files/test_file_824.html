    This isn't relative to me, but i've seen people on here and SR say that they've gotten love letters inside of the original packaging of their orders (minus the contraband of course).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now this is just my humble opinion, but if LE were pursuing any kind of charges, wouldn't they want to keep the envelope, as it is evidence? Or perhaps a counterfeit love letter issued by a vendor?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wondering what people thought of it....Proceed with conspiracy theories  ;D

    If it is not a vendor scam of some sort and you do get the original packaging, I'd feel safer that they were not bothering to follow up further on that particular shipment. I think they would need to save the package as evidence if they were going to try to prosecute. Saving stuff and making up a new letter to send (with new postage) is more effort/expense for LE than tossing a form letter into the existing shipment. They might input the addresses into a computer system for future trouble-making though.

    For small amounts I believe they will simply confiscate the contraband and not pursue the matter further, not worth their time.

    Aren't all of our addresses in their databases? :P
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have often wondered just how many addresses they have to keep up with.  how many of them have been flagged?  And do they flag the address or the people living there?  Seems like a lot and almost impossible to keep up with, considering how much people move around.
    <br/>
    If they flag the address itself, you should check out previous tenants before you move into a place if you are going to use that addy for the road.

    I'm sure its just an ever growing database.
    <br/>

    And I think all they would need is suspicion to contain something prohibited, and for it to be linked to a previous address that has had something seize.

    I think that alone is enough for them to open it.

    Not to get horribly off-topic, but I see this word thrown around so much and there's no clear cut answer or method as to what actually happens;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Flagged"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets just say customs has intercepted your party favors, how does this "flag" work?  Is it a simple entry into a computer database? Or does it stop actually prompt them to (somehow) single out your drop address for future incoming mail from overseas? The latter doesn't seem feasible to me, but then again I know very little about how they play the game...

    "Might"? Are you joking? Customs has realtime access to Lexis-Nexis databases to look at the criminal history, employment history, tax records, credit records, phone numbers, previous addresses, etc. and they also have a detailed history of every confiscated parcel, probably with photographs of the packaging, and definitely they record the return address and receiving address. Any time they happen upon a package to you in the future for a random cursory inspection, they can see how shady of a person you are in seconds by searching for you on their computer.

    I agree they can do stuff like that^ in a well-funded/staffed Customs office that does what they can. Maybe US Customs is a well funded and well oiled machine everwhere? I really don't know and like to hope they are underfunded slackers pretending to be^. And, other countries...? I don't do International shipping as I am admittedly ignorant on the subject and happy to hear the opinions/facts of others.

    If you get a legitimate love letter then they decided searching your house wasn't worth their time.  Eventually they are going to destroy the drugs and it is the drugs that are the evidence not the package.

    I think a project "false flag" would be interesting. Sending small amounts of drugs (weed?) with bad stealth to random people, to increase the workload on customs. Sure it would be a waste of weed, but it would be a great prank to pull on them ;) And we might just feel a bit safer afterwards.

    This is the same idea as was in that movie that just came out with the rock, snitch. I could see why it makes sense for them to put the love letter in the package. Because you than can't claim that you wouldn't have opened the package because it wasn't for you.

    Definitely one of the cons of using the alias method.
