    Hi guys!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Wanted to get in the thoughts of you people on what do you guys think is the best method to stop the rattling of the pills??
    <br/>
    I am a vendor here on SR and have been selling pills all this while. Your thoughts or experience on how have you got packages where the pills rattle especially when they are blister packed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any help is much appreciated
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers!!
    <br/>
    Happy shopping  ;D

    Put the pills in a vac seal bag. Don't stack them on top of one another, just put them in the bag so they are as flat as possible, then implement some stealth on top of that. For blister packs, vac sealing might help. It might make some of the flat foil side of the blisters tear open, but its worth it to make the pack more stealthy.

    I have never ordered pills, but some ideas, like sealing them with a vacuum sealer should make them stay in place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or if you don't have the means for that fancy stuff, some plastic wrap would do the trick, just test out what seems to be the best option for you. :)

    If they're blistered, you would need a VERY strong vacuum to make it so pills can't move inside each blister. That's why (pretty much) nobody mails in blisters.

    Otherwise, what everyone else said.

    I ordered from a vendor awhile ago and the pills came in the original blister packs. Needless to say they were loose and rattled slightly which put me off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I then ordered from another vendor and he also included the pills in their blister packs. However he laid them out completely flat in 3 rows of 10 and then placed a strip of the thick packing tape all the way across each row. This basically taped each blister pack in the row together forming like a "belt" of blister packs, three solid rows. Several layers of printing paper on each side for flatness and in a standard large document envelope that was as flat as can be. Was PERFECT not any thicker than a few pages of legal documents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the blister packs were poorly made and the pills are not snug in each little dimple they may still rattle, these were snug. I wish all vendors included the option to remove from original blister but some don't. It does however help for resale when you have the fancy/legit looking blister to show off.
    <br/>

    Thanks  a lot guys for  the suggestions. Well the thing that actually causes the pills to rattle is the space in between the blister that is there. The actual space where the pill actually is between the blister and the foil on the other side. I have several times put pressure on the blisters to decrease the space. Any more sporting ideas as to how can we succeed on getting the space to decrease??

    You can't really, without destroying the integrity of the blister package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess the simplest way of doing so(yet very painful if you have 1000s of pills) would be to poke a hole in the plastic and then forcing the air out of it, so there would be 0 space for it to rattle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The 2nd way would be to ship them without the blister packaging, which could damage your sales, if you're a new vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All the very best to you all!

    tried the piercing of the blisters. But it doesn't seem to work that well.  The blisters are not exactly round,but in the shape of the pill.They are flat with space inside for the pills to hit up with it and makes noise.

    Is the blister made of plastic? Some plastics shrink when heated. Just an idea I had from making bongs of plastic bottles.

    That is a great idea!! The only concern is that the heat doesn't harm the pills pills in any way. Will research about this . Will try this thing out as well and post the result.

    If it is the right type of plastic it will shrink really quickly when its heated to approx. 75-125 degreesw celsius, I dont think the pills have time to heat up that much. What I would test is either quickly run it through a bunsen burners flame or heat an oven to a 125-150 degrees celsius and put them in there for about 20-40 sec. maybe. Could you test them yourself maybe after to test if the effects are still there? Cooling them down in water right after? Just some ideas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And of course you can send them to my place and i'll tell if they were still ok.   8)

    As has been stated...you need to poke a tiny hole thru each blister cavity and then vac seal.  Doing just one or the other will not solve the rattling problem.  The hole allows the vac sealing to remove the air from each cavity thereby creating a vacuum.  No air = no rattling.  Btw, the tiny hole can be made by poking thru either the back or front of each blister.

      not yet made! But I am kinda worried that it will affect the pills. They are suppose to be kept at room temperature. Don't  know if this will affect the chemicals in the meds. Does anybody have an idea about it??

     If it is the right type of plastic it will shrink really quickly when its heated to approx. 75-125 degreesw celsius, I dont think the pills have time to heat up that much. What I would test is either quickly run it through a bunsen burners flame or heat an oven to a 125-150 degrees celsius and put them in there for about 20-40 sec. maybe. Could you test them yourself maybe after to test if the effects are still there? Cooling them down in water right after? Just some ideas.

     And of course you can send them to my place and i'll tell if they were still ok.   8)

    Bear in mind that there's still air in the blister. You'd need to poke a hole, heat it (I suggest a heat gun, with the foil sitting on ice or something, to keep the pill cool from the other side), and then maybe you'd get a snug fit.

    I imagine it might be easier to muffle the rattling itself; a t-shirt wrapped around it and packaged could work, no?
