    hey,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    how high is the risk in getting small amounts of drugs from the following locations to Germany?
    <br/>
    Germany -&gt; Germany (domestic)
    <br/>
    France -&gt; Germany
    <br/>
    UK -&gt; Germany
    <br/>
    US -&gt; Germany
    <br/>
    Canada -&gt; Germany
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The domestic option is obviously the safest. I guess UK would also be pretty safe since it's in the EU and ordering from there is pretty common? France -&gt; Germany should be a bit less safe I guess because while it is also in the EU noone orders (legal) things from France. US and Canada are pretty unsafe I guess because they are NON-EU. However I guess US is still safer then Canada because of being a common place for ordering legit items. Am I right in those assumptions? How high - in percent - do you think is the risk of getting caught when receiving small quantities of drugs from those locations? And if I get caught what would be the worst consequences I need to fear?

    Why you copy TylerDurdens name ?
    <br/>
    Could be harmless but just so ya know hes a well known vendor and if you intend to post misinformation it aint gonna work!

    Hey,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    sorry for the naming-confusion. You can calm, there actually was no evil intended :). I didn't even know a vendor named TylerDurden exists on here. It's a name from the movie Fight Club so it's a pretty obvious idea to use it as a nickname. If some admin has the time for it, you are welcome to give my account a new name.

    <br/>
    BTT: Please answer my questions about shipping safety.

    I think you've ranked them about right for safety, but really you should worry more about the stealth of the vendor than the country they ship from.

    You are right about the stealth of the vendors packaging being very important. However I think the country is also an important factor to consider because if you get your package from a high-risk country like, for example, the netherlands, I think being controlled is very likely even with excellent packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I right in assuming that UK -&gt; Germany is nearly as safe as domestic shipping?
    <br/>
    What would be the worst-case-scenario if an order gets caught by the customs?

    Uk now screens outgoing mail as well as incoming so it may not be as safe as it once was.
