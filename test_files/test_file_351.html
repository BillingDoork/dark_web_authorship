    Friend of mine started a vendor account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think the packaging is ok-good. But if something would be opened, it would be evident that something is fishy.
    <br/>
    Some of the highest ranked vendors stealth is less good. But they always arrive and people give compliments on the stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some people claim that certain packages have not arrived. IMO this seems pretty impossible. Even an x-ray machine would not see anything suspicious. So there are people out there looking for new vendors so they can try to scam them?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What happens then? Will the vendor just have lost the product and no money + bad feedback?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The person has not opened a topic about this yet, so hereby I do this in advance.
    <br/>
    Suggestions are welcome. Too bad I can not elaborate on the packaging methods..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once I got something in silver foil. I do not think that is smart, but that vendor never got problems by using it. Other vendors send prescriptions in blisters. That would definitely show up on x-ray machines.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe there is a rule or something? Like packages over 20 grams get inspected more often?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any advice would be appreciated :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace

    Hey P,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Too bad nobody replies.
    <br/>
    Perhaps people who feel like spending some time on helping out a starter through pm's or email would want to do that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not cool to spend time making a nice package, shipping it and then not hearing anything from the customer anymore. Then the only option is to hope that the auto finalize will work and not that SR orders to do a reship or refund or something. Otherwise I'd have to increase my prices by 2-3x as well in order to not lose everything..
