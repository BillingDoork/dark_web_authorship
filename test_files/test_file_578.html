    Just received my first AND second package today at my new PMB. Needless to say, I am pretty dang happy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered good bud from 2 separate "flagged drug states" in the west/midwest. Just small amounts of bud.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These states are definitely flagged, especially since the new laws that have been passed which makes recreational cannabis use legal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOW my questions...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything seemed to go smoothly. But next I plan to order an OZ and then after that probably a QP (hey, vendors, who's got the dank?! anyways..) and am wondering if my mailbox is flagged since two packages that came from flagged states both arrived today? It may make it worse since the box is relatively speaking brand new.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OR maybe this is pure paranoia speaking. Just really want to hear the experienced travelers wisdom ^_^
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks again!

    Hey Empathy101, have some empathy - I'm a noob -_- I see people write where they're growing around a bunch so I didn't think that was a problem at all. As long as the receiving state is left out should it not be fine to mention the shipped from state? I suppose to answer my own question it would be fine only if the vendor already has their location publicly visible. Ahh,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That is no excuse though, I apologize.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And yeah, all that is of concern is having been profiled and scrutinized before and/or regardless of this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously clock-work like shipments from suspicious states may not raise red flags in the shipping phase before it gets to the local mail facility. But once it goes get in the hands of local mailmen, they will recognize patterns. I know they would, they have nothing else to do all day! (lol)
    <br/>

    Thanks for your reply though. Good to see people helping others. +1 ? (I'll try)
