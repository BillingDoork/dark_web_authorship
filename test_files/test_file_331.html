    Hi,
    <br/>
    I have searched manually and used the search function but with no real success.
    <br/>
    Therefore another thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have seen that a lot of vendors, EU or even non EU, don't ship to the USA.
    <br/>
    Now I can remember from experience in the past that getting stuff from USA was easy. But sending something back was a bitch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's say, for example, I'd like to ship some pills or powder to the USA. What is the best way to do that? And with what shipping method? I didn't fully understand the usps/ups thing. I did see someone using overseas shipping for it, which costs about 1.5btc (holy crap!).
    <br/>
    Do pills get detected by dogs? If not, then they are preferred over powders I think?
    <br/>
    What kind of stealthy packaging would be best? At this moment I think that just putting them in one seal bag, then into another, and perhaps a third, would be fine. Then wrap it up in paper so it becomes more "solid"m put it in an envelope with bubblies in it, but then, ship how?
    <br/>
    (When working with seal bags, always use gloves me thinks, cuz of fingerprints).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I read a lot about written letters are not good. But can't it be that it would seem less suspicious then? Like it's just a letter or something? Though it should not be written with ones own handwriting ofcourse.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope that some experienced NL, or EU people could share their experience with shipping to the USA. USA seems like a difficult mission to me, but it would be awesome if there is a way that works.
    <br/>
    To NL users: what postal service would be recommended? Any approximations of envelope/shipping costs?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is just an hypothetical situation though, since I'm not a vendor yet. But once I am I'd love to go worldwide :)

    Really, I could use some advice here, either directly in here, or by giving me an url to a thread about this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm guessing USA people would like it if more people ship to the USA, right?
    <br/>
    But that's really not an easy job...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So: bump

    With as many posts as you have I would expect you would have some understanding about the SR community... Discussion of shipping methods is a "no no." Also, there are many topics with these type of questions. If you actually do some researching instead of being lazy you will find the answers to your questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly, if you cannot figure out how to ship and be stealthy on your own you should not do it in the first place. You are not only risking your freedom, but that of the buyer as well (kind of.)

    yeah

    my first order from there didnt show! second made it after that i dont roll those dice~ They are one of the red flagged countries! trust me! they are high on the radar!
    <br/>
    so its your choose but even the great vendors from there use a reshipper out of NL
    <br/>
    so its your call and good luck

    About the pills, too late anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And yeah, there seems to be a strict policy for sending from NL-&gt;US
    <br/>
    The other way around doesn't seem to be much of a problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stupid US, grml grml.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And karma on here doesnt mean anything. People give bad karma very easily once they dislike something/somebody. + karma is not as often given for liked things/somebodies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They could just as well remove the whole karma thing. It's pointless.
