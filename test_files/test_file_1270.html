    I was curious about vendors thoughts about shipping to hotels. Do you guys do it? I received my first few orders today and one was to be shipped to a hotel but i am a little hesitant to do so. What are your guys thoughts?

    I would think that the largest issue is whether the package comes on time and doesn't arrive after you've left. How long are you planning on staying?

    Different hotels have different levels of security.  I would make sure and do some recon on the level of security at whatever hotel you plan on shipping to.  I would also advise ordering legit packages along with anything you order from off the road in order to throw off suspicion.  Make sure you have an air tight story as well, as to why you are getting packages sent to a hotel room.

    It's definitely not the most ideal.

    They usually hold them for you. And they sign for them if need be ;)

    It's not unusual for a professional,mechanic or tech to need to get mail when traveling. What about being on vacation and needing a credit card or [insert something important here] sent to you. It's not unusual or big deal unless the person receiving makes it out to be one.
