    I feel ya on that one.  I have had priority arrive in two days many times, but I have had it take a week or more.  The other day I had a regular first class letter that arrived in about 48 hours.  It's strange, but that is how it works sometimes.

    My stuff has been coming in 2-4 days, even across the country. I don't doubt usps is having issues in some areas maybe. I saw a news article that said something about usps closing some sort facilities, so it was causing wacky stuff like a town's mail to get shipped many states away for sorting, and then to come back, even if the mail was destined to be delivered in that same town.

    Yeah waiting for the mail's a bitch.  I'm stressing right now as I'm waiting the longest I've ever had to wait for a Priority package.  Package shipped Tuesday the 9th and here it is Monday and nothing.  If it shows tomorrow it'll be a 6 day delivery lol.  I messaged the vendor so hopefully I can get an update here soon.

    We had an express letter that vendor said mailed the 2nd. Think they dropped it in an express box..it scanned into the system 5 minutes or so before midnight on the 3rd...of course the 4th was a holiday so the usps express letter technically was overnighted the 5th..to arrive the 6th.. It didn't track past the 5th..and showed up with our express mail person on the 9th! So a week for an overnight...way to go usps!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also arrived completely soaked..

    We all know waiting sucks, but I have to add that I have many, many years of very positive experience with USPS Priority Mail, mostly legal and now some illegal.
