    is it a bad idea to order marijuana from silkroad?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    because it smells so strong and dogs can sniff it so easily?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    is marijuana most likely to be seized ebcause of the odor it gives off?

    i want to order marijuana. Daily. So that i can smoke it Daily. But i don't want dogs to be sniffin my dope!

    imagine having a dog sniff your dope, and then they send it to you, and you smoke it and its covered in dog saliva??? that would be gross. I don't want that to happen. or for some postal man to steal my dope.

    If you order from a good vendor it will be triple vacuum sealed and the only problems you'll have is gaining weight from all the munchies you'll be stuffing down your throat.

    They all have sufficient packaging. You will know what i mean by sufficient when you open the pack. :) They are listed in no specific order. They all have good bud, customer service and fair prices. I love them all and it makes it really hard to choose between them when i get paid lol.

    Most of the time your package won't even come in contact with dogs. They will go through electronic sniffers. Also, all these vendors know what they are doing and take their time to make sure the packaging does it's job. I've ordered countless times. All different sized orders, and haven't lost a pack yet. They know their shit.

    Weed being the hardest drug to conceal is true but the people here have good enough packaging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And drug sniffing dogs never happen as it would almost be impossibility to get a dog to sniff when thousands of letters are going through the postal service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only time a drug sniffing dog will come in is when a letter / parcel looks suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then they will get the dog to sniff it so they can then get a warrant or whatever they call it to open the package and do a controlled delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your better of just ordering weed on an unfrequent basis say once a month for like an oz I believe as it's less risk and anything up to an ounce is normal,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    unless you are small time dealer and keep baggys all over your house scales etc.

    I have shipped marijuana to friends domestically within the U.S. plenty of times. Of course, this is easier to accomplish than international shipments of marijuana. When it is shipped domestically it is significantly easier. I would just vacuum seal it 3 times and throw it in a box and ship via USPS. It came through on time every time. As far as ordering weed through SR goes, I have no experience with this so I cant comment on any of the vendors methods. Although, if you are receiving marijuana internationally there is a higher risk because of the need for a signature. Hope this helps.

    Yes dogs are rarely used. There is just too much mail to sort through. I do know that most of the seized packages the feds get is a result of someone snitching, an address being blacklisted and watched, terrible packaging, the use of Fedex or UPS, or a combination of several of these factors. Fedex and UPS have much higher security than USPS. I use the postal service all the time and I have never had a seized package with them. Fedex and UPS on the other hand have grabbed a few goodies. Even domestically..

    I've had over 700 transactions and have never had one seized, I am a big cannabis seller and am fairly confident with my shipping methods, if you're interested in bulk amounts of cannabis then just go ahead and send me a message on SR.
