    Recently had a package not show up from out of country. First time something hasn't shown up.... will they always send a love letter, or it it possible they confiscate your entire package/envelope and flag your address?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Insight appreciated

    I've had packs seized and no letter.  But then also ran into the issue of whether the vendor ever even sent the pack.   If it's a decent amount not showing up, I'd lay off that address for awhile.

    It's been over a month since my 10g of MDA was supposedly marked in transit from Canada. I've never had anything not show up. So I'm just hoping customs didn't seize it and flag my address.

    I have had a couple big orders never make it from Holland and never received a love letter. Each one was 100 methadone pills and they were sent to two different addresses that had never had a seizure letter or lost package before. On the other hand every order that i have had seized from a IOP out of Pakistan i got seizure letters for. So, there's really a few things that could have happened. 1. could have just been ripped off, he was a good vendor but never know when they may be hurting for cash. he didnt use tracking so no way to know for sure if he sent them. 2. they got intercepted by Dutch authorities and if that happened i do not really see anything happening except losing the package, unless ur getting crazy weight i really dont see the Dutch going to the dea or customs with them. 3. US customs took them and never sent letters out.
