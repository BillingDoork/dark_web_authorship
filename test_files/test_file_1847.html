    I understand how this works domestically, but is international a different deal? I ask this because I was packaging some express and priority international mail and noticed it said "International Restrictions Apply" and "Customs forms required." What does this mean? And also, I need to know if what I did on postage was correct. I buy express and priority (domestic) "stamps" from the electronic postage machine at the PO. What I did here was simply put on the amount of domestic postage that equaled the price for international priority/express. For example, international priority is 16.95, so I just put 4 domestic $5.15 stamps on the package. International express is $38.00 so I put two $18.95 express stamps (with some first class ones to cover the ten cent difference) on the package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please let me kno what to do about the customs forms/if my method of postage appliance was correct. Thanks.

    First of all my understanding is that Express Mail (EMS) for international always has to be presented to a counter clerk at the post office, prepaid or not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The customs form is the "green form" 2976 or the huge white form 2976A.  I have tried to use the small green form on a priority mail package before and the clerk said the large one was required.  So, I assume that any priority or express mail to overseas needs the large form; the small green form is for firstclass overseas mail up to 4 lbs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My last Express Mail Flat Rate to overseas, prepared at the post office and paid with cash, got form 11B as an address label and form 2976A as the customs form.

    One more tip, there is a box for EEI/PFC on the forms
    <br/>
    <br/>
    check or write this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOEEI ss. 30.37(a)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What you are saying when you indicate this is that an export license is not required (mainly the value is less than $2500 and not going to axis of evil countries.)

    Anybody know what will happen to a parcel if the customs form isnt filled out or gets lost? Would it possibly still make it through? or will it just get returned to the return address and then destroyed because it doesnt exist... for the US, it says that you dont need a customs form for first class international mail. So do you think that it would be sent through anyways?
