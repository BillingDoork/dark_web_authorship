    I ordered some poppy pods a month ago but they were opened at customs.  They delivered the any way with a UPS driver forcing me to sign.  I received them and used them.  I recently order 1 kg more.  Should I be worried that customs is preferring a sting on me or did they just fuck up before.  The pods were not hidden at all.

    I know, I know. It was before i knew anything I learned before i visited this site.  I signed for it came home and then noticed it had been opened by customs.  Three weeks later since the first one went okay i ordered again.  That was before I visited these forums.  Now I am just going to refuse delivery.

    UPS always requires a signature, don't they? Nothing to do with customs or drugs. Perhaps an error of judgement on seller's part by choosing UPS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You probably wish you lived in the UK: not only wouldn't the poppy pods cross international borders but if you're not at home, UPS would deliver the parcel to a neighbour, getting their signature instead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Were the poppy pods crushed and labelled as something else? Otherwise, it's hard to see how did they get through the first time unless you have very lax customs.

    Yeah I'm surprised they allowed any plant material through customs. I don't know if it's the same as here in Aus but plant materials are a big no no.

    My sister had a package of tea from Japan opened last year by customs, then delivered with a customs label on it.  So just cause they looked doesn't mean they picked up on it.
