    If I placed an order last Wednesday or Thursday, when do you think it should ship? Both of the vendors say that they try to fulfill orders in less than 24 hours, but this has been days. The last time I had to wait this long for an order it ended up getting cancelled. Should I be worried?

    Depends who your order was with. Sometimes vendors can get really busy with orders, emails and IRL issues.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Did you FE?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you placed your order with a reputable seller within escrow then you have nothing to worry about and they are probably just busy. If they said they usually dispatch orders within 24 hours then send them a brief message asking them when your order will be sent if you haven't already.

    Hey I get 20-25 orders a day and have 2 small children I have to show affection to. We have a life outside SR and a lot of us vendors are sorry it takes sometime to process orders but this is a mix of Business &amp; Family.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am so overwhelmed by response to my products that this has become a 16hr a day job.So days I dread opening my SR page because I know what is waiting 20-30 orders and 10-30Â  but I always do my job and actually enjoy the thought of over turning the world with drugs

    was it domestic or International delivery?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What was the shipping option you chose?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have you PM'd the vendor and asked?

    I didn't FE, I haven't PM'd them (yet) and the shipping is domestic. It doesn't ever leave the country I'm in. It's good to know that I shouldn't worry about it though.
