    Yeah, so my first package ever from SR. Regular mail came around normal time (10:30/11:00). And I assumed I didn't get my package. Then I checked again hours later and there it was. No clue how long the time was between them, could be anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Package was Priority, so could this have something to do with it? This has me freaked out. Anyone else had this happen to them?

    Hmm, I placed an order of Methylone and it came the next day. It was a fairly hefty domestic order which surprised me. Strange.

    haha I don't think that's the case. Some neighborhoods receive two shipments a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Your case does seem really strange though.

    funny you say this.
    <br/>
    a buddy of mine made his second purchase or so.. and it was a 1/4 elbow... from a certain someone.
    <br/>
    any who, the mail ran as normal, nothing. he walked outside to check the mailbox just in case, nothing.
    <br/>
    he stood outside for just a little bit.. and low and behold, here comes the mail man/woman flying around the corner waving
    <br/>
    a 1/4 elbow in the air smiling... LOL.

    It depends on how they sent it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think its first class or overnight, that has a guarantee of delivery by 4pm on the last day of estimated delivery. So if it comes into the post office after theyve already delivered your normal mail they will send out another mailman (sometimes even dressed in street clothes) to deliver it to you.

    Radiodog, what you saw was nothing out of the ordinary.  Mail carriers carry all of the letter-sized mail in their first route walk.  If it's a heavy mail day, and they didn't have room for all the packages in their bag, then a few minutes later, they'll do a separate round with packages, sometimes even more than one if there are big packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously, this doesn't apply if your carrier is a driver, like in a rural area.  Another possibility is that there was a misdelivery, and one of your neighbors got the package and put it in the correct box.
