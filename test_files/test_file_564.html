    Anybody freaking out on late shipments from UK to EU, relax.
    <br/>
    Order that was shipped Dec 23 arrived today in regular airmail letter.
    <br/>
    Order shipped Dec 10 was lost, tracked letter reship arrived tracked after 9 days today.
    <br/>
    Another letter marked shipped Dec 26 took 12 days.
    <br/>
    Parcel shipped on Dec 31 arrived after 6 days.
    <br/>
    So it appears RM has a bigger backlog in letters than parcels.

    Just had a order arrived dated 14th of Decemeber from US another arrived a few days before from NL that I ordered around 14th as well, so yeah there's still a huge back log so any one thinking their package isn't going to show up, don't worry...Jan 20th is the cut off point in my opinion.

    I ordered from djabbar for the 2nd time last weekend.
    <br/>
    He gave me the tracking info yesterday. It was posted on monday and it's being shown as still in the netherlands being sorted.
    <br/>
    This seems bad to me.

    Is trac and trace always accurate?

    I'm actually receiving most orders in record time now, the Christmas period was pretty hit or miss though.  I had an order from Canada come in just 4 days, and one from NL in 2.  I no longer have temporary workers doing the rounds, my regular postmen are back.  So props to RM in my area for delivering on time and the vendors for dispatching promptly.  I am expecting an order from Mexico sometime which has been on it's way now for a while, but I haven't ordered from there to the UK so I'm not sure how long that typically takes.  I have ordered from Brazil and Argentina and shipping from that region took about a month.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had more problems recently with legitimate orders outside of SR, I bought a few things off ebay from domestic sellers a week ago or so and they're screwing me around claiming they've sent it when clearly they haven't since everything else has been arriving quickly without delays.  This is one of the things that most impresses me about SR, most of the vendors here have much better customer service and dispatch/delivery times than most legitimate online stores.

    Still waiting (eight days from NL). UK mail has a backlog, apparently. I doubt it's the vendor. Let's hope poor Postman Pat is just getting his sack in order.

    As I noticed unusually long shipping times FROM UK TO EU I checked RM website and it says a lot of EU post is delayed due to bad weather and cancelled flights for up to 5 days.

    Domestic post for me has been swift every package arriving mostly in 24hrs from dispatch at most 48hrs with 100% success rate even with this snow of late.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not ordered much from abroad this month apart from what would be a letter from NL marked as shipped on 7th Jan but no sign yet, vendor has agreed a reship so will see if that arrives and let you know. This is my first 'no show' package in 40+ transactions.

    the muskabuzz are having a terrific experience with royal mail shipping from california:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a new record speed was set in january: 3 days
    <br/>
    average: 7 days
    <br/>
    worst: 3 weeks
    <br/>
    <br/>
    our average delivery time over the last year has never dipped below 97% and is frequently 99%, today it stands at 98.3

    Yeah, a lot of Holland and such have really bad snow just now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Plus, all the packages I've been sending out have been getting delivered in decent time. Always next day within the UK, and only a couple of days to the EU and such.

    RM are alright, they are all dozey fuckers and a bunch of the young posties are thieving bastards but other than that most can do their job.

    2 inside a month that diddnt make it to me, both from NL
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One vendor was happy to refund me based on my stats, took all of 30 minutes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fucking livid with the other one to say the least, a month of pingpong messages, this one was an ounce and when the resolution centre was there, me and the vendor came to an agreement, then when it was under review the vendor apparently messaged SR support to request a 0% refund, which they of course gave to him.

    Thanks for the information, connoisseur. I did look at the Dutch post office site (I do speak Dutch), but didn't think to check the railways.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Certainly assuages some of my anxiety. Since others have recieved from NL in a similar time period I can only venture that mine was in the sack that got stuck.
