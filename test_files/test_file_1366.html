    Got an order coming from netherlands to UK with tracking, has anyone out there used this? Just want to know if it'll require signing for? I asked the vendor and they said they dont know, probably not as it will fit in the latterbox. However if its tracked then surely it'll need signing for in order for the vendor to know its arrived.

    most of the times no it will track until customs if it's tracked afterwards be careful but pick it up if something happens deny you know what is in the package, pretend to look surprised to see that you've got a package.
