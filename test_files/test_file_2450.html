    I placed a very small order (1g weed, US to US) last Wednesday with a relatively new vendor that has great feedback. It's been a week now and I still haven't received my order. The vendor said he shipped it vac-sealed in a regular, odorless envelope and regular postage. It looks like other people are having the same issue as he updated his vendor profile to let us know that he's switching to USPS Priority with DCN because he's had to refund a lot of people who haven't received their orders (although many people have.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, I'm not worried about the vendor - he's been great and I'm confident I'm not being scammed. I'm just wondering if I have any cause to be alarmed or concerned with the USPS since the package is 'missing'? I've placed 10+ orders before this for much larger amounts and they all came to me just fine. I'm just hoping that my address isn't flagged or anything crazy like that since this is the first time this has happened to me!

    First of all, 7 days isn't much. Not at all. Give it a little more time. I got shit after 10+ days.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today, the tricky LE and post office sent me a little note saying I had to go pick up a small envelope, which would normally NEVER require signing, from the post office.
    <br/>
    Well, not me of course, the non-existant person from the fake adress I've been mailing to. So they want to arrest me! The cocksuckers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, shit like this happens. What you must do is never give up, they mustn't win. If they did indeed flag your address, which isn't likely. Use another address. They can never get us. They are in the process of, and eventually will, lose the war on drugs. We gotta win brother!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing to worry about, is losing 1G of weed. Not a big deal. They can never have anything on you to arrest you if you play it right. You never knew what was being mailed to you. Who knows what crazy drug addicts sending drugs through mails mistyped an address and it ended up going to you? Actually scratch that. All they need to know is that you know nothing. Deny everything. Get a lawyer if shit hits the fan. Which it won't. Unless you're ordering kilos of drugs.

    Thanks. Just never had anything like this happen before - all of my previous orders from other vendors (all domestic) have always came within a couple of days. But if they did discover anything, I doubt 1g of weed would be worth even looking into. At any rate, I'll be picking up some more BTC and ordering from a previous vendor (all of which have come successfully) to make sure my address didn't get flagged or anything like that!

    I feel ya. Most of my product is within domestic of the USA and I'm used to shit arriving within five days. I have one order that is going on it's 12th day and still isn't here. Some times, it just takes a hell of a lot longer than it should. Hope it arrives soon!

    Unfortunately, on some rare occasions things seem to happen to the mail. :'( Your package could be lost, misplaced, stolen, seized or still in transit to your letterbox. I've had a couple that never showed but 2 out of 50+ orders is nothing when you compare the prices of the local market. Have a little patient and pray that the God's will come through! :)

    True. Were you ever contacted by USPS or anything on your two lost orders (assuming you live in the US)?

    Sorry for the late reply but to answer your question, I wasn't contacted by anyone and I don't live in the U.S. However, the 2 orders that went missing were actually made during my first 10 purchases here on SR and since then, I've made dozens of purchases with every package turning up. :)
