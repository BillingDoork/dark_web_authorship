    Stuff the whole package into your conepiece and smoke it, it's the only way to be truly safe...  ;)

    On a less sarcastic note, I guess it depends on how paranoid you are. Some suggest writing in big red bold letters RETURN TO SENDER on the packaging and waiting a day or two to make sure no LE show up, and if they do being able to claim the package isn't theirs. I think the majority of the time you would be fine opening it and disposing of the packaging as you seem fit.

    If you didn't have to sign for it or even if you did, leave it sit unopened for a while. It won't hurt you to wait an hour. If you get a knock and get asked any questions about the package, you know nothing and if they want to see it hand it over.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I thought i might have been an xmas present"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they knock and you have powder on your nose, the package has been opened and has powder in it, you are going down. Letting it sit gives you a reasonable story to tell. Anyone could have sent it but only a guilty person would lie about getting it especially after opening and sampling the contents.

    Take it a step further and go with something along the lines of " I understand you are just doing your job but I am unable to speak to you without my lawyer present"

    I would unwrap it, but check it hasnt been tampered with, take your stuff, and rewrap with something else inside.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then write return to sender, unless you used your real name. :P

    Enjoy delivery.
