    You probably already know  it. But for those who are living under the rock: there are UK shippingg new rules from 14th of January,
    <br/>
    I rett a leaflet today, when I wanted send international mail:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (use a clear outside of TOR):

    (We can't send arms and marihuana. OMFG, O'Rly?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok, back to the topic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My questions;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Is it outgoing only or ingoing  mail as well?
    <br/>
    2. What to do to to secure our packages. I cannot believe that they are going to check (X-Ray) every single post...And I cannot buy lead (Pb) box for every package I send.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you thin?

    The Royal Mail changes are to bring them into line with the rest of the world, so they'll apply to incoming and outgoing mail.
    <br/>
    They certainly seem to be x-raying more than they used to, I've had a couple of orders containing stash lighters stopped and shipped surface mail instead of airmail, the stash lighters are empty plastic cases so it could only be an x-ray image that would highlight them.

    So bottom line there's technically nothing new? If they are just being brought into line with the rest of the world vendors stealth should be no problem. But I know for a fact British customs Are very tricky as it is and have quite a big parcel stop rate compared to a lot of places in Europe.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    does this mean vendors are going to have to up their Stealth?
    <br/>
    Is it a downhill slope from here in the SR world. Of course smugglers have always managed to keep upto date with security.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    heres hoping

    Last time I sent a package abroad, I was shown a card with pictures of prohibited goods. "we now have to ask everyone if they are are sending these items", said the PO lady.
    <br/>
    Solvents, firearms, nail varnish (?), marijuana, medical waste, to name a few.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Still the same self-declaration customs sticker for the parcel though.
    <br/>
    Seems like more strict guidelines on sending out, but I'm none the wiser about Royal Mail's inbound screening process tbh.
