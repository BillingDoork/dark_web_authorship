    I know there is always some risk in importing illegal or grey-area drugs from overseas, but I was hoping some people might post who have a better gauge of all this than I currently do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets say I order a kg of methylone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know packaging plays a role here, but for the sake of this thread we cant specify that, so lets just say the packaging is "average" - Maybe its bagged in mylar, or just heavt duty plastic, nothing is done to conceal the fact that inside the package is a big back of some chemical, but there is paperwork in chinese claiming it to be some common thing.  This is generally what I have seen in my past orders...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are the chances of LE/customs stopping the package and essentially figuring out it is not legitimate?  If you look at review pages for vendors offering things like this, there are pleanty of good reviews, so I'd say this has to be less than 10%.  They are rare, but I do see the occasional thread about customs grabbing a package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the instance that an order IS discovered, what are the chances, or what factors influence whether or not this leads to a search warrant + controlled delivery?    Is there any way to anticipate this?  Tracking for these packages tends to be really unreliable.  Sometimes it just doesnt show up until the day it is delivered, other times it will show the package spending a few days in customs as in enters the country, and then almost as soon as it gets past customs it will be delivered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs doesn't find packages and send them through anyway to "build a case" against someone do they?  I have heard of people that got love letters and just kept ordering and they eventually get busted.  If I never recieve a love letter and always recieve the product I ordered, the chances that LE/Customs have my address flagged is probably low, correct?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If someone in the US were to be busted by LE with a controlled delivery with 1kg of Methylone is there any guideline as to what the punishment might be?  Assume no records and nothing else is found at the house, if one just denies any knowledge of the package and a warrent doesn't find anything is it likely that one would get off?  (basically the only evidence against them is the signed (or maybe unsigned package).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If one were to answer the door and is suspicious (since one almost always has the same few delivery people) would it be smart to not sign for the package.  I feel like I read somewhere that if they set up a controlled delivery, they are going to bust you even if you dont sign?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know there is discussion and answers to lots of this throughout the forums, but it is very fragmented and sometimes contradictory or seems outdated, so it seemed like it might be nice to have an entire new thread dedicated to risk apprasial in importing bulk RCs from China (or anywhere I guess, but most of them seem to come from china)

    Years in federal prison.  I know a couple people in federal prison for exactly that.  They were ordering their methylone and RCs from the same people gonzo and thescienceguy and some other kilogram RC vendors middleman their orders through.

    A key is a lot of drugs man. There is a decent profit margin for domestic methylone, don't risk your freedom on that shit dude. 100% you will not get a love letter for a kilo of anything - I don't care if it's fucking donuts.

    Not to mention that methylone is a schedule one drug in the US.  That is the same as a kilogram of heroin and worse than a kilogram of cocaine.

    if you EVER EVER get a love letter... at any drop..
    <br/>
    discard that drop, it is ruined and done with.. and has been "listed".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    second of all..a kg? jeez.. if you're so worried about customs break it down into 250g shipments...
    <br/>
    but hey, that's just me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and of course they are going to bust in your fucking house if they found drugs...
    <br/>
    whether you accepted/signed for the package or not...
    <br/>
    that's where DENY DENY DENY comes in.
    <br/>
    get yourself a god damn good lawyer... and i am sure you have money seeing as you're importing kilos of methylone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    good luck...

    For most of the RC's these days, there is no gray area. If you're caught there will be serious penalties. I would suggest working with someone who has plenty of positive feedback (SoS) and never go over 250g at a time (and have the vendor split up those packages at that).

    Any specifics you can share would be appreciated.  How much had these people ordered in total and over how long?  How big were the orders they got busted with (Was it done by a controlled delivery?)  Was other proof of their activities found when they got busted, or was the order in and of itself enough to go to prison.  I would think a controlled delivery that leads LE to find stashes of other bulk drugs, bagged for distribution, etc would be a very different thing than if they bust someone for a package, but find nothing in the house that links them back to the crimes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also feel as if its not so far fetched to imagine might notice something is amiss with a controlled delivery.  Does refusing to sign if this is the case do much in terms of protecting you?  I'm assuiming they have a seach warrent whether or not you sign for the package, but if you dont sign, say the package isnt yours, and nothing is found in the house, it seems like they wouldn't have much evidence.... Thoughts?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also is anyone willing to guess how often these packages get notices/stopped vs how many get through?  When I look through reviews on kg listings of methylone and the like there are dozens of reviews saying all went well, and the vendors tend to claim it is extremely rare their packages get seized (although they are trying to sell a product, so I take that with a grain of salt.  I also see a lot of posts claiming that a kg package of RCs were taken by customs but there was no followup/arrest/controlled delivery.  It obviously depends on country etc, but you think that if US customs finds a kg of methylone headed for someone they have no prior record/knowledge of, that they are very likely going to set up a controlled delivery and try to make an arrest?

    We were only discussing details about people I personally know that were busted, not techniques or anything.  Details that some LEA could piece together and know who I am talking about so I don't feel like divulging such information with people.

    He is a vendor on here and what you are talking about doing is a very scumbag thing to do.  There is a 5,000% difference in the price of methylone and MDMA.  How would you like it if a jewelry store sold you gold plated brass as gold?  Or if Budweiser sold you a can of piss?  Oh but they look the same and they're making a killing so that would make it okay right?  People like you deserve to get busted. :)

    I've sold countless kilograms of methylone as methylone.  The effects really aren't that much like MDMA.  I think methylone is to MDMA as a bicycle is to a motorcycle.  Should a motorcycle salesman sell a bicycle as a motorcycle because it's like a motorcycle and he will make more money?

    Of course not and I am not trying to say anything different. Is it that commonly known of now around raves and etc? I mean if someone were to try it once they would definitely see it's value but I feel like it would be very difficult to sell at the street level that way.

    Methylone has flooded the US market.  It is very common and yes scumbags still sell it as MDMA because it is worth less when you sell it as methylone.

    You need to know exactly what you are doing when it comes to stuff like that. You see time and again people getting a bright idea of importing some RCs, not checking the situation and then fucking themselves over financially or getting put away. You should really seek the advice of someone who has been doing it for a while, RC manufacturers can be quite tricky to deal with.

    If you want to deal directly with the manufacturers you need to do your research.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I recommend finding a trusted friend who speaks mandarin and have him phone the actual factories to work out prices, payment details and packaging stealth. They aren't difficult to find if you know what you are doing and they are much less likely to rip of a native Chinese speaker. Your best place to start is Wuhan, Hubei. That's where the majority of China's pharmaceutical intermediates are made.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't ask them for Mephedrone until you have built up trust after several sales and have a working relationship with the factory, or they will often tell you they don't make it.

    Definitely not a good idea. Remember there will always be someone on the other side telling you it's "fine" to send pretty much anything. Customs is a whole different ball game than domestic...

    It's not that you shouldn't do it, you just have to have the whole procedure nailed down to a T before you do it. The problem is that a lot of the time people think mislabeling and sticking and MSDS and COA will do but it don't cut the mustard anymore.

    Just look for someone domestic dude or just go for the real thing, MDMA.  Dependant on who you order from, you get get it through or it could get stopped and you will indeed get royally shafted. And all that for methylone when you can get MDMA domestically ? I don't think so
