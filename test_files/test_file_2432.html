    I need some suggestions. From what I gather, the thermal transfer handheld devices are untraceable, correct?

    Traceable to what exactly?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do the label rolls have an ID?
    <br/>
    Does the Label printer leave an ID?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assume both of those are the case. If you bought all of the goods with cash where is the connection between you and the labels/machine?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Very interested to hear further about this myself

    Yeah that's basically my question in a nutshell. Trying to figure out whether or not anything (that includes the printer, labels, ink, ect.) can be traced to back to the original point of sale. Even though I intend on paying cash, the thought of cameras still worries me.

    Wear a hat, etc...go pay cash for a decent Dymo printer.   You will be fine.  I know some printers print some info in yellow in some obscure spot on the paper...that may be larger laser printers.   Nevertheless, I would always pay cash and be discreet.

    Possibly so.  They could match up the reciept time to some store footage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just go disguised a bit...Hat, hoodie sweatshirt, and buy one with cash when the place is somewhat busy.   It's your best option I'd think.

    Thermal printers cannot put tracking information on the paper because they don't use ink. The paper itself is specially treated, and by heating parts of the paper the paper is marked. Thermal paper has very limited options when it comes to it being marked. High jinx like the deal with the laser color printers and tracking dots would be way way harder to pull off with thermal paper. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's highly implausible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take a UV light and shine it on the roll of thermal paper. Nothing should stand out, it should fluoresce white uniformly.

    If you live in amerika, take cash, buy a mass built printer from walmart and change it every time the ink runs out...doesnt matter if they are trackable, cant process millions- and not worth it for small unit sales- if you were a medellin cartel than you might want a different approach.

    Rotate through various printers- its not difficult and makes it far less likely to be caught, especially when you use dead drops/ live drops and extras for assistance in dropping occasionally. I prefer my life as it is, no wants or warrants cleaner than the driven snow.

    What you might need (vol.) is a variety of labellers, so you can mix it up to prevent a package profile being established for a specific vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To be honest you have to realize that all our intercepted packages wind up in an incinerator. They might take photographs (since handwriting = bad), but when you consider the volume of packages that Ebay produces alone...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You have to be doing something pretty unique to stand out. Like fingerprints! There are more important concerns than which thermal printer you're using. Like having a proper staging area. Like mixing up your packaging style. Like randomizing your postal drops. Etc.

    Ink = VERY BAD. Ink is identifiable down to the lot (batch when it was produced) - which is then traceable to the wholesale distributor or store it was purchased by. From there, the store can pull up every single purchase of that particular product in the last... say... forever? Match those purchases with video footage... one MASSIVE step closer to knowing who you are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as label printers, I would definitely agree that going thermal is a good choice. If you'd rather have something multifunction - like, you know, a printer that actually prints regular shit - you could go with a MONOCHROME laser/laserjet printer. Monochrome laser printers DO NOT imprint tracking information as the whole reason the tracking exists in the first place is to stop people from printing counterfeit currency.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From there you just need a pack (or several packs - get a variety of manufacturers/colors/whatever - of 'Avery' type labels and print them that way. PLUS, as I mentioned before, you can still use it to print your resume :P

    i can't believe that every printer (inkjet, laser or whatever) can intentionally be traced back to the point of sale. Ink from a label can be traced back, after its dry, to a certain batch of ink so that they can pinpoint the store where that cartridge was bought?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i guess if you get busted, is the printer going to be evidence of you sending the parcels? i can only imagine that in that scenario they would use the printer to tie it to the labels, but even then...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    perhaps its because i am from the Netherlands, i don't think they are even able here to figure out where a printer was sold by providing them with a serial number...

     Ink = VERY BAD. Ink is identifiable down to the lot (batch when it was produced) - which is then traceable to the wholesale distributor or store it was purchased by. From there, the store can pull up every single purchase of that particular product in the last... say... forever? Match those purchases with video footage... one MASSIVE step closer to knowing who you are.

    I apologize if this comes out as rude but I read this and I had to say something. This is the biggest crock of shit I have ever read in regards to Printer Steganography. First off it has only ever been proven that this is done with Laser printers NOT Inkjet. Second off, IF BY SOME MIRACLE OF GOD they were able to get Tracking Dots off of your INKJET printer and it was detailed enough to give them a batch number. Do you have any ideas how many printer models are sold at any major store?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I go buy a printer from Walmart and put it on my CC, do you know how many other people have purchased that print? literally thousands. You think there going to go door knocking. That's assuming I didn't pay cash for it. I'm not saying your home free printing on inkjet, but don't make every fucking vendor on here paranoid who has printed labels on there home printer.

    I always thought the danger of printing on inkjet was the fact that a piece of paper that you printed using that printer could be 100% matched to you if police raided your house and confiscated the printer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also thought that closed circuit camera records were definitely overwritten every couple weeks and certainly not kept longer than a month. They're only kept for records if there was a known robbery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SammyAce over here says it's laser printers and not inkjet that the tracing is applicable to.
    <br/>
    Can anybody clear these up for me?

    SammyAce, my post had nothing at all to do with stenography. Ink printers don't leave tracking dots. However, the composition of the ink is, as I mentioned before, identifiable to the batch in which it was produced. Color Laser printers leave dots to prevent counterfeiting of currency. Monochrome laser printers are great.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is it unlikely that you would be caught based on a printer purchase? Yes, absolutely. Is it impossible? No. It's also more likely with ink &amp; laser printers... that's the takeaway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    echo_, you're more than likely right about the video being written over and the cycle being about a month or less. Either way, used equipment is the most secure I would think.

    I apologize I misread your post and though you were referring to Stenography. In regards to the composition of the ink do you have any links regarding this topic? I've never heard of any counterfeiter ever being tracked due to composition.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any more info on this topic would be much appreciated.

    I doubt that being able to trace ink to a batch would be of much use to LE. Batches are huge, and probably spread over a wide area, and stores don't keep video for very long regardless.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would be more worried about paying for the shipping labels honestly. Don't you have to have a credit card linked account at USPS or Stamps.com to buy and print labels online? Couldn't LE just buy a package from a vendor, then ask USPS what account paid for that specific label? I'm pretty sure all packages get a unique ID number when they're shipped, especially if they have DCN.
