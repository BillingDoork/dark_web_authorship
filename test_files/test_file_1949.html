    I've got some questions about signing for packages, specifically larger orders. I've read a lot on these forums about how a lot of people are suspicious when asked to sign for a package, as they fear it is a controlled delivery. I also know that a lot of vendors ship in a way that doesn't require a signature, but some may. Is there any situation where you'd be required to sign even with a vendor who ships in a way that would normally not require a signature? What about with a PO Box, they certainly couldn't require a signature there as they can't expect you to be there every time a package is delivered. Or would they expect one once you arrived to pick up the package? And finally, how do you react when asked to sign for a package that you didn't think you'd have to sign for?

    i'd personally just reject the package, i don't want to take any unnecessary risks, who gives a shit about a package if you could go to jail
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have seen around this forum that people have had to sign for shit that they weren't supposed to, and everything worked out. but this is rare so probably if you're asked to sign it, get ready to be stressed out for a while :/

    I guess I'll check with the vendor. If he says you won't ever have to sign, no matter what, I'll take his word for it. Hopefully that's the case... I'm also still wondering about PO Boxes.

    Yeah if you specifically PM the vendor and get confirmation, u can be 100% sure you shouldnt sign
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and the PO box thing, they'll just ask you to sign at the desk before claiming ur pack

    If you are really that worried about it, just ignore the mailman and don't answer the door when he knocks. If it is not a controlled delivery, then he will just leave a note that says something like "Sorry we missed you!" and you can just go pick the package up at the PO the next morning. You can be assured that it is not a controlled delivery in this case because simply put, LEO wouldn't just be waiting around at the PO for any unknown amount of time, waiting for you to go pick the package up (they're not just going to stake out the PO; for all they know, it may be a week before you go pick the package up). You will have to sign for the package at the PO, but like I said, if it has gotten to this point, then you can just chalk that up as normal postal procedure.

    I am just speculating and do not know police procedures but almost all PO have cameras and they could quite easily just review the tapes at the time your package was marked as picked up. Not to be paranoid but just be aware that they may not need to stake out the place 24/7

    I'd be careful with that line of reasoning. Having recently had a bad experience with poorly packaged weed, was searching miscellaneous things and came across this story:

    http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Man-woman-arrested-in-marijuana-investigation-2276963.php
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At least in the first case, the man was arrested *at* the post office. I'm assuming they were waiting for him there. Granted, it was a lot of weed. In the second case, it's much less weed, controlled delivery. Looks like fake name was used. Did that help her? Nope, she gets charged with forgery on top of possession. Yikes!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The moral, for me at least: never sign for anything.

    Interesting link there! Especially since this topic is about "larger" shipments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I must say that signing for a package for personal amounts is hardly different from not signing, as the evidence taken from a signature because u received a package in your name is not gonna be solid evidence. Most people immediately sign any package sent to their name. I would think it looks far more suspicious if you act extremely uneasy about the package, instead of just signing it with a quick "oh where is it from?" while in the process.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, marcopolo's link also had reference to the fact that the convicted in this case committed forgery, which is a whole different law you want to avoid breaking, just FYI; if you do choose to sign for a package, use a real name!

    I'm with you Regicide. You have to just imagine yourself in the shoes of someone who isn't doing something illegal and think about how you would handle receiving a package (in your name) that you weren't expecting. You wouldn't be like "NO WAY!! GET THAT SHIT OUTTA HERE!!" You'd just be like, "Oh, okay. Where's it from?" And if you're really worried about cameras catching you when you go to sign, just buy a bunch of IR LEDs and line them to the inside of a hat and you'll look just like this:  http://hackedgadgets.com/2008/02/21/ir-leds-used-to-defeat-security-cameras/

    years ago, i would look out my window and study the mail delivery person whenever i had a uncomfortably big package. I knew my mail women, and her replacement.. so i know before she even gets to my house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    one good thing about the mail system, you will usually get the same delivery person, and if i seen some odd ball looking fed, i will have nothing to do with that order.  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    in regard to po box.. find one without a camera. possibly travel to a smaller town or city near  your area.. the older mom n pop post services may not have a camera.  i'm sure a sting operation can be set up..   there have also been times when i caught my mail driver on their actual mail route before they get to my house..  and signed for a very large amount of mda pills packaged like shit- from europe. haha
