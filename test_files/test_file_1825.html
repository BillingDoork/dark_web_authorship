    OK, I live in the Netherlands and I'm interested in providing you guys with some top quality drugs. Basically I've got everything I need listed and I'm working on some deals with my supplier. I've also got a great new way of shipping things safely and for a low price world wide. I do however know that some buyers prefer tracked mail (and some sellers do so as well because you can easily prove you sent out the mail) but this is where I get into a bit of trouble. How am I supposed to send out tracked envelopes without having to go to the post office and face someone working there in person? To me that's a very big issue. And would I have to sign? It might sound like a stupid question but I've never sent out any tracked packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, -and perhaps a few people who are also from the Netherlands will know this- what postal service would be the best to use? I was planning on sending untracked envelopes by using the standard TNT mailboxes but if I want to send out tracked mail I bet there are a lot more options (UPS for example).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have read through these forums a lot lately and I love this community. I hope you can help me out with this issue because I would really like to provide tracked mail as well. :) xx
