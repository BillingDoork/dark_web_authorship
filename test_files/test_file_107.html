    I'm in a office building with about 10 other businesses...does that seem better than shipping to my house in my personal name? even though my business name is obviously connected to me. does it make any difference?

    i could actually put my business name and send it to another suite...i'm sure the postman will either leave it at my door, or the owner of the other business will bring it to me...what do you think about that?

    Sending it to another suite I wouldn't chance on.
    <br/>
    1) there's always one nosy employee...actually several. All it takes though is one to go snooping and there ya go, your business and personal life have been ruined.
    <br/>
    2) how many times does it happen that someone sending something to your business with your name personally fucks up the suite number. I know if I was sending something, I wouldn't. I'd be damn sure that I'd want my dude to get his shit (whether I was a vendor on SR or it was just legitimately from grandma.)
    <br/>
    I'd tread carefully with the business address.
    <br/>
    Best bet if you do send it there is to use all of the correct information.
    <br/>
    Also:  make sure it's "attn:" to you. For example your company is Smith Inc. You'd want the pack to say Smith Inc. Attn: John Smith, suite 111
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Could be wrong, but...don't think so.

    If you're the only one who opens the mail, I would think sending it to your business could work.  If you know your mailman, even better.  If someone different delivers the mail, don't open any of it all day.  I wouldn't put it attn: your name if you can help it.  Just be sure your secretary or some other employee isn't going to open the mail.  Don't put the wrong suite number on it, that would look suspicious and makes it more likely that somebody else would get it and open it.

    I've thought about this also because we have a po box for our business. Someone outside the company picks it up every morning and dumps it on the reception desk. What cha think about that idea?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My reluctance though is if you get busted at work then a whole lot of people will know and any chance you had to privately try and deal with a potential prosecution is shot to hell.
