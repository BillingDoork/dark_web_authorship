    Hi,  I have never purchased from SR before and Im interested in buyng some mdma, just a small amount for personal use.  I would only purchase domestically as I'm not willing to risk it coming through the airport etc
    <br/>
    How does the mail work in Australia?  If it comes interstate to Sydney is it flown in?  I dont want to purchase anything that has to g through an airport because of dogs etc  What is the likelihood of being caught if only purchasing nationally?    If I was caught for say 4 or 5 pills what would happen?   Thanks

    As far as I know, shipping domestically in Australia is generally safe. And the odds of your shit getting taken it very very low, as it doesn't have to pass through customs. I am considering getting some Weed and Acid domestically and by reading the vendors page and reviews, I think there is an extremely low chance of losing it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am also deciding whether to ship MDMA internationally from SR, as it is about 1/10th of Aussie Street price and about 1/8th of Aussie vendors on SR.

    IMO, pure MDMA is the way to go: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/8c25dd55f0

    shipping within australia seem relatively safe to me. i've made three transactions with no problems whatsoever, although i've only purchased xanax and oxy, nothing powdered, although i wouldn't think it'd be any different. they just look like regular letters, nothing suspicious about them at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i vaguely recall reading somewhere that domestic mail isn't even handled by anyone until it's in the mailman's hands on the way to your house, it's all sorted by machines or something. i would like to know the process more specifically though and what the chances of getting caught are.

    Okay, some basic Capitalism 101.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, you may have noticed the 'Internet revolution' where you can now buy things at 'global prices' instead of the typical Aussie "I want at least a 30% margin for doing fuck all" prices yeah?  I mean, you're here, right?  ;D
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Okay, glad we sorted that out.  Now, generally speaking, you can charge more for something if you 'value add' - that is, offer something the competitors don't.  Generally from what I can tell, Aussie dealers offer........fuck all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yeah sure, they 'take all the risk' on your behalf...but do they?  Let's see.  They have a higher chance of getting busted because they're moving volume, you're not.  You get busted with 1g of molly, you get a little fine and a slap on the wrist.  If they get busted with your details, you're just as at risk as if you bought internationally.  So, how are they earning their 400% mark-up?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They can ship to you next day, whereas the reliable molly vendors overseas take on average a week.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anything else?  Not that I can think of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Okay, so, you'd rather pay $250 bucks for a g of molly rather than the $55-$65 you can buy it internationally, just so you can save yourself 5 days of waiting?  Wow, how fucking dumb is that!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh no!  What about the risk of your letter being siezed!?!  Surely one coming all the way from Europe is in perilous danger!!!
    <br/>
    Statistically, the global SR success rate of packages making it thought is over 98%, and me personally, I've never not had one arrive.  If you can pick a good vendor, you'll CONSISTENTLY get repeatable delivery times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, you've got $250 burning a hole in your pocket and you're concerned about risk?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Run the numbers on this.  The average global price for molly is about $65 a gram.  For $250 you can at least buy 3g internationally, so, hey, spread your risk!  Order from three different OS vendors, and even if only one arrives, you're still ahead.  Two arrives, and you're in the money.  Three arrives and you're so far ahead it's not even funny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any questions?  ???

    The post I posted is full of evidence and reasoning as to how I feel about ordering internationally.  ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I see no evidence that AU dealers are somehow more trustworthy than OS ones.  Customs is an added layer of risk, yes, but I personally think it's preferable over having a local dealer having a delivery address that can reasonably easily be attributed to you.  That's just my judgement call and I think it's fairly reasonable.  There's the risk of customs, but I like the 'tyranny of distance' more.  :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Same with the pricing.  I haven't seen anything that justifies the margins local dealers are asking.  Heck, there's no other layers of distribution selling on here, yet most vendors still want 200-500% margins.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Heck, you want to risk manage even better?  Buy overseas, and the price differential between local and OS prices, stick it in a bank just in case you get busted for that piss-ant 3g of molly you ordered from the EU.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hands up who wants to pay a local drug dealer a 400% margin to manage your risk for you?  Anyone?

    This is quite simply not true. I buy plenty of those express post envelopes for my in real life legal business. If you buy a 10 pack, they only scan the "price" barcode and put in qty of 10 in the cash register. They do not scan the "tracking" barcodes, so there is no way to link those envelopes to a purchase. Also, the post offices open up the 10 packs and put them out in the shop as singles for people to buy. How would they know which ones were bought as singles and which ones as packs. And lastly I just had a look, and the tracking barcode numbers does not seem to be in sequence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I would say if a vendor went to a large post office, mix and matched "single" envelopes and bought them with cash there would be no way to trace or correlate them.

    +1 Dingo!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Shiznit, we normally do agree with you musings around the forum. However, we must disagree with your assertions on the Express Post issue.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First of all, we agree with you it is possible for a pathetically stupid &amp; amateur SR seller to be traced back by Express Post bar code technology from POS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, for a professional and career SR seller this is VERY easily avoidable including some of the tips that Dingo made in the previous post. There are many ways to avoid this and we will not go into intricate details of these on a public forum, that would be be silly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We @ EnterTheMatrix™ have been vending for coming up to 13+ months now on SR via domestic and International mail and we have developed some highly advanced techniques to avoid detection of our products, this is proven that EnterTheMatrix™ has NEVER HAD AN ISSUE with Law Enforcement from the 1000+ packages mailed and SUCCESSFULLY delivered, with Express Post and regular.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We are serious about security.

    can i ask, is the money you get in change from the supermarket in sequence? no, but can be traced back to a batch...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    now what is that number of packages per 'batch' ... your imagination is the limit.

    Interestingly a recent package I received (product was packaged well and all accounted for) had a PO BOX return address which I looked up and found it was a firm somewhere in the country. Of course it is fake, but the nature of the company was a little concerning. I didn't feel too comfortable having that address as the return address even though it was never going to reach there as I provided a correct address. Not sure what the vendor is thinking. Interested to hear your thoughts... PM if it's too sensitive.

     Stop encouraging people who don't know what they're getting themselves into to jump in the deep end. At the end of the day you don't know what the fuck will happen if something gets intercepted.

    I am guessing you have spent some good time with a solicitor on the subject, MyChemicalRomance (your alias suggests your are a child. Anybody else want to listen to the advice of a kid? I'll take my infinite wisdom instead thanks!) . People need to realise the effects of a criminal conviction firstly. Secondly, consider the fact you aren't Tony Montana and when some seasoned D's come and visit you will fold like a deck chair and incriminate yourselves. Happens SO MANY TIMES in law because people think they are smarter than they actually are.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We are seeing a market price adjustment with domestic SR . It lowers by the month. It will stabilise as I wouldn't be selling mdma for instance for less than $200 a gram considering people in the street pay $400 for it. It seems, people like MCR get shirty because they know what it is worth wholesale from O/S . Well, hate economics, don't hate vendors. No vendor will be comfortable accepting a 10, 20 or even 50% markup when they can have 400%. SR market doesnt set the price as much as our local market will.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People are in business to make money, not to simply be in business  to help people out! I doubt a non-profit organisation would exist in an illegal market! They WOULD be some heavyweight crims though!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Utilising cheaper markets for drug acquisition is not good advice to be giving people on this forum. Safest routes should always be advised. It is pretty obvious that the greedy pigs or dealers will go O/S for greater risk and increase profit margins. But people, seriously... getting $200 mdma grams in Aus through your mail and you have an issue with it? If you could even find it, how much were you paying for it before SR...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I bought drugs at the local rates before SR. I still do. If SR goes tits up and we are forced back to local dealers, will you use this same sentiment to quit drugs forever rather than paying the 'huge and unjust' mark ups that you have been made aware of?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Get to the end of the line, commie...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is just philosophical, I will not read your response.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    p.s: I sense that people want to prices of drugs to lower on domestic SR vendors so they can deal it and make huge profits themsevles without the risk of customs/AFP (which you can do now anyway!). We all know the law of diminishing returns kicks in relatively fast with nacotics (that is, provided you keep a job !) so it is not like you will increase your purchases of drugs as prices dive anyway, so there is no incentive for vendors to comply.

    I thought it was pretty funny actually, and just made to prove a point.  No, what I really advocate is doing exactly what local dealers and their sycophantic arse-licking mates tell you to do.  Ignore the fact that mostly their gear is shit and overpriced and you're telling them pretty much exactly where you live.  Mere technicalities.

    I always advise safety, it's just that I think buying locally isn't significantly enough safer than a good OS vendor.  I don't want local vendors having my details.  I don't want to pay their margins.  I don't want to buy Ivory's molly from Matrix when I can buy it from Ivory.  That's awesome that you don't agree, I'm fine with that, but it's just your opinion vs mine, that's all it is.

    Pretty much, yeah.  I could take it or leave it.  I just come back to it when I'm bored.  :)  Plus I already have years worth of shit anyway WHICH I BOUGHT OVERSEAS  ::) Regardless, although I do find your unrealistic hypothetical fun, supply and demand suggests that there will be another SR pop up in no time.  Or maybe there already is?  ;)  I dunno, you're the expert, you tell me.

    Guys we are all here to provide and take advantage of choice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are reasons for buying domestic at higher prices. This is a comfortable route for many who are nervous about border control. I would agree that giving your personal name and address to a domestic vendor involves risk. Mitigate it perhaps by using a fake name or title and perhaps a PO BOX or work address if that suits you. I sleep easy knowing that I have avoided having my personal details in the lap of someone that might live in the same suburb and supplies drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are also reasons for buying international at lower prices for the reasons stated above.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We're on the same team people. I'll repeat it again... SR is about choice. Let's keep the discussion productive shall we?

    Therein lies the problem. We are trying to educate the new buyers. I really do not agree with MCR whatsoever, and I think it is safe to say many others wouldn't either. Yes we are all entitled to post our own opinions, and yes they will definitely not be the same as everyone elses, but I think when you are trying to prove something that the vast majority of others do not agree with, do not give it as advice to new members of this community. How on earth you have come to the conclusion that ordering from overseas is safer than domestic is well and truly beyond me.

     The SR forum has a 'rumor mill' and 'product offers' for a reason you know?
     <br/>
     That reason is to stop vendors from hijacking threads with spam.

    on SR I guess. Anywhere else, physical dealer / in a club, I would be very happy with even $400 a gram in Sydney for MDMA! 40 bucks for a clean 100mg pill seems affordable for me. Even in the late 90s I was paying 30 for pills which admittedly were insane and probably more like 150mg or more with added benefits of some fill that bent you out even more (caffeine, meth, vicks vaporub..who knows!?). long drunk story short, $300 for ten pills a decade ago compared to $400 for the same effect more or less now is low inflation relative to the increase in demand. mdma has had a huge increase in acceptance in this country. It went from unknown to accepted...It never even hit the infamous status! (maybe I just know very liberal people though!? oh now... I know a WIDE spectrum of professionals... :S )
    <br/>
    <br/>
    more than $200 a rip off, as stated? definitely disagree as a professional with good disposable income. As somebody accepting SR as the only portal to the black market however, I totally agree :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In all, after 'losing' so many letters in the past two months (from dodgy fucking scamming eurotrash cunts!) I will happily pay the 'extortionate' rates of domestic SR for reliability .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All I ever wanted was a reliable source of quality pressed hash... how did I end up here?!

    Oh definitely if we are talking about street prices I was referring to SR, my street prices of MDMA are quite higher then my prices on here but only still around $250 a gram. Compared to SR $185 and lower for balls etc. I rated my Australian pills at 50-60MG no need to lie and all customers are extremely happy just to see Australia molly pills. But... given the continual down slide of pills I fear they will only continue to get weaker as the next generation is still more then happy to pay and keep paying for what is supplied at the moment. I would love to supply 100MG pills, but put simply they just aren't available anymore. Sure I could ask for pills to be pressed at a higher dosage, but at what cost? And the general public aren't willing to fork out $40+ a pill when they are used to $20.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My feedback speaks for its self and you receive the same product and great service minus the $60 aus domestic surcharge over my prices many seem to be applying and I will admit I still make quite a heavy profit.
