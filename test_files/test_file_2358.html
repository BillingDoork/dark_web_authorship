    Is it advisable to tape the outside of Flat Rate Priority Boxes with shipping tape? Or is that suspicious in regards to profiling?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks In Advance

    I'm assuming you're referring to the smaller priority flat-rate shipping boxes than the larger ones.  When I used to be a powerseller/top-rated seller on a well-known clearnet site, I would put small amounts of tape on the sides - mainly to ensure the package wasn't opened in mid-transit.  And although all my shipped items were legal, I had few, if any lost packages - I think out of 3000+ packages in three years, only four were lost and of those, one eventually made it's way back to me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Long story short - I don't think it would be profiled as long as you don't get crazy with the tape and tape every single seam closed.  Think about the legal packages you've received, and you'll have your answer on how to make a package look inconspicuous.
