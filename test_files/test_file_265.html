    I's it recommended to look up DCN via. TOR or clearnet?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if it is recommend to look up DCN/tracking # via TOR or clearnet. I know the topic is hotly debated in which I have never heard a definitive  answer.
    <br/>
    Any thoughts?

    From what I've seen on the forums, it's recommended to NOT look up a DCN using TOR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do it using clearnet but from a public wi-fi spot like a Starbucks or somewhere so that they can't track the viewing IP back to your house.

    IMO it depends on what service you use to look up the dcn. There are several third party services you can use, and I feel safe using them through TOR. I feel less safe using public wifi unencrypted to check DCN.

    What "other third party services" are you talking about if you do not mind sharing that kind of info?

    There are several of them, use clearnet and google or duckduckgo "check usps delivery confirmation" and you'll get a whole slew of services that use the USPS api to check dcn numbers. I don't want to post any specific sites here because we all knw that LE read these forums, but it isn't hard to figure out with a little internet magic  ;)

    Go to packagemapping.com via TOR and you'll be fine.

    no problem, don't stress, just use your head. More people are busted by pattern recognition than by old-fashioned gum shoe detective work.
