    i'm sure plenty people already know this, but as i've seen a few vendors shipping UPS, thought i might share some observations with y'all. in my current day job i have to deal with UPS a LOT (usually sending 30-40 packages via UPS each day) and those guys is jerks. losing packages, delivering to the wrong address... all that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it seems especially bad with international packages sent via UPS-- for domestic (USA) vendors in my humble opinion there's no better option than the good ol' United States Postal Service. reliable, cheap, inconspicuous, and strapped for cash so they can't hire too many inspectors!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but what's given y'all the highest success rate, shipping-wise?

    Every major shipping company has roughly the same success rate of nearly zero interceptions for domestic and a bit more for international

    I've never worked with UPS.  SR users recommend USPS because as a government agency, it's necessary for them to obtain a warrant before your mail can be searched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Non-government mail services... (UPS, Fedex, etc..)  May not be any more likely to open a package if it is suspicious.  However, the grounds upon which they decide to conduct a search are completely irrelevant because they're not a gov. agency.  This means even if their search is unreasonable or completely unmerited, it would still be admissible evidence to convict you in court because they're considered a private party.  They are also more likely to hand mail over upon request.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While the rates for seizures from all major companies are low... USPS is still the safest.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My 2 cents.

    Pidgins are the safest imo. I always get small orders pidgin delivered. For larger orders i use USPS.
