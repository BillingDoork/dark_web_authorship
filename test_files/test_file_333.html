    I only receive two types of mail. Bills, and goodies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now that the SR cat is out of the bag, doesn't it make sense that USPS employees would be instructed to be on the lookout for people who get lots of mail with DCNs on them?

    It's a standard service from USPS. I would be surprised if SR orders took up more than 1% of the total DCNs. So no, I doubt it's an issue. On the other hand, express mail for weed has caused a few issues. I'm guessing express mail is inspected more thoroughly since it is a popular option for MJ buyers and express mail isn't as popular of a service. It is still very rare for these to get intercepted anyways.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So relax, smoke a J, and wait for your orders to come.

    I think the problems arise when vendors try and push the rules too much with their packages. Express Flat Rate Envelopes are popular here because they are easy and cheap. But excessive thickness or tape to seal the envelopes is frowned upon. Priority Small Flat Rate Boxes and Priority/Express Flat Rate Envelopes must be sealed "with the packages' own adhesive" and not be held closed with additional tape, but a small amount is okay.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But as far as DCNs go, they are not suspicious. Everyone wants their packages to arrive and have proof of it, even the USPS themselves. I personally think receiving a large amount of non-bulk envelopes and packages WITHOUT DCNs is more suspicious.

    That's correct...avoid taping anywhere on the outside of a package.  It's one of many red flags Postal Inspectors use when profiling mail for seizure.  Also, if you unwittingly place tape across any portion of the postage stamps ....technically, it renders that postage NULL and VOID.  Now, this is one of those official postal rules that isn't always enforced across the board. I've seen pkgs with some part of the stamps taped over make it through but I have also seen pkgs not make it out of the city they were mailed from on account of the postage being voided.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to reinforce the envelope seal on say a Flat Rate envelope...spray adhesive works great.  Also, a glue stick will do the job.

    Absolutely all good stuff here, need to be quoted. Yes to all of this! Fortunately I haven't seen tape over the stamps but that's a big one that could stop any package in its tracks... the PO worker might be generous and sharpie it but I wouldn't count on it... I've seen some moderate overtaping but nothing too crazy yet. Instead of loading it up with cheap bargain tape, get a big pack of the heavy-duty 3M/Duck stuff and one strip will do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A big can of spray adhesive is one of the best things I ever bought, for general use as well as shipping... Glue sticks are great as well! Doesn't get much more common than that.

    DCN is not suspicious. Quite the opposite. A friend of mine had a package seized (not from SR) and they basically gave him a checklist of what a postal inspector looks at. The big "no, nos" were:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Excessive tape
    <br/>
    Not a valid return address
    <br/>
    A name that does not match whatever other mail is going to that house
    <br/>
    Overnight delivery WITHOUT requiring a signature
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you think about it. This all makes complete sense. If you sold an item and the person wanted it overnight, wouldnt you (and the customer) want to have a signature? Your not going to pay extra to ship something overnight and just not care if it gets there. DCN's on the other hand are great for regular packages. They are cheap for the seller and still leave you with proof that it gets there. All kinds of businesses use DCN. Id say if you DIDNT use DCN it would be alot more suspicious.
