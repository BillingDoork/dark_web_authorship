    I have read through many PO Box threads, and have not come across an answer to this question.  Can I have lets say 6 PO Boxes under the same name in approx 100 mile radius without getting them flagged on principle?  Particularly if I ensured they all were fed from separate USPS hubs. Basically, I need more drops.  All suggestions welcome.

    Theoretically, it can be done without raising flags but you'd be much better off if you weren't using same name.  I know someone who had several different box drops in various delivery zones in same name.  He once had a delivery that was delayed because it somehow got originally sorted out to one of his other addresses.  He could tell because of the handwritten notes on the pkg directing delivery to a different zip code.

    Any maps or charts that show the hubs and flow of mail? Would like to put a little effort into higher level strategy to avoid those exact issues.

    Sounds like they got the zip code wrong.  I never heard of that happening.  If you the zip code is wrong then the package will end up at the zip code and not at the city written on the package.

    He had two boxes in same name at two different zip codes.  Now the zip codes were not that far apart but the pkg in quest0ion was addressed correctly.  When the pkg was received he could see it had first been sent off to the other zip code but correct zip had been crossed out and the incorrect penciled in.  It was subsequently re-corrected so it was delivered to the address originally  intended.  The point was that the guy could tell from deciphering the cross outs and scribbles that someone somewhere along the way knew that name had boxes in those two different zip codes.  To my knowledge nothing ever came of it.

    That is so strange.  I've seen that happen plenty of times when the zip code is wrong but never when everything is addressed properly and very legible.
