    I recently had someone place an order &amp; they wanted it shipped to an airforce base. I canceled the order telling the buyer that I just did not feel comfortable sending to military base, especially since the address was not encrypted. They asked if they encrypted the address, if I would consider sending. I still don't like the idea, but I thought I would see what other vendors thought of this. Thank you for any input.

    I know my office building x-rays and regularly opens post thats sent to me there, sure a military base is going to be at least that cautious.

    But as long as your shipping method is secure, why not. If you have been a vendor for any real amount of time, the chances are high that you shipped drugs to the DEA already, and the DEA investigated drugs alot more often than the airforce. Now if it wasn't drugs, but rather some chemical weapon or device designed to throw of the guidance ability of the jets, then I wouldn't just because of the threat you would be putting service men and women who are protecting our country in dangers way, But I think they deserve to cut loose and enjoy some drugs when they are on leave, and that is where they get their mail, so why not.

    PS, the absolute best LSD I ever had was taken on a military base.

    @wretched...You do have me tempted as I do feel my package is quiet discreet &amp; so do many of my customers, I would almost like to see if it make in.

    I think that I am going to stick with my gut on this &amp; not send. Thanks for everyone that gave input.

    Never ignore your gut instinct. That's how people get killed on space ships when the alien eggs hatch.
