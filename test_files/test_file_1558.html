    Hey All,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I ordered a package express on Saturday. No tracking, so I have no idea where it actually is.
    <br/>
    It was supposed to come today, and did not. Is this common, for express mail to be a bit late?
    <br/>
    Should I already be worried? Should I REALLY worry if it doesn't come tomorrow?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks
    <br/>

    Need more info. What country are you in? What country is the vendor in?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have you spoken to the vendor to ask if it's been sent?

    I once had a letter shipped to me express from the EU that appeared to get lost. A few weeks later, I get a notice on my door that a letter had arrived, my signature is required, and the mailman missed me so I must pick it up from the post office myself. It freaked me out a little bit- this was, after all, just a letter, not a package- but I went and signed and everything was okay. There were 25 hits of LSD inside. The letter was not tampered with. Apparently, unless explicitly requested for signature exemption by the sender, express mail requires a signature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So that ^ may be what is happening. I've read in a postal worker's AMA on this forum that express mail is taken quite seriously compared to normal mail, and employees can get in a lot of trouble for screwing up deliveries. I think that makes it unlikely that your letter has been lost, but who knows what happens in that series of tubes we call mail.

    Sorry- I'm in the US, he is also in the US.
    <br/>
    I thought vendors ALWAYS made it so you did not have to sign for packages...I got a package priority and they just left it here.
    <br/>
    Also, if it did require a signature, I was here..but I could've easily missed a knock on the door...but either way, they would've left a "while you were gone" slip or something, which they didn't.

    You shouldn't be worried at all. In fact, you shouldn't even have expected it today.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Express mail has a Saturday cutoff of noon at most Post Offices, and to my knowledge isn't accepted on Sunday at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chances are the vendor received your order on Saturday but by the time it was all enveloped up the cutoff time had passed. I think some vendors mark stuff in transit when it's packaged, not when actually shipped.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Assume it was actually in the USPS system Monday, and will be delivered today. Or if you or the seller is out in the boonies, Wednesday. If by 3:00 pm Wednesday you don't have your order the seller is dragging their feet and you should reflect that in your feedback considering you paid out the ass for express.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck to you sir.

    I actually received an email from the vendor today.
    <br/>
    He said not to worry, he checked the tracking and it will be here by WEDNESDAY.
    <br/>
    I am annoyed to say the least.  I specifically told him I needed the package by Tuesday, because I have a friend coming on Tuesday night and I want the package here before he's here to avoid any awkwardness.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He did drag his feet, and it seems to me he didn't send it out until after the cut off by Monday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why do vendors know how to CHARGE for express, but don't seem to understand the concept of it?
    <br/>
    I certainly did pay out the ass for it, and I feel like this is absolutely unacceptable customer service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, if I leave anything less than 5/5 feedback, I'll be blacklisted.

    Bullshit

    If you ordered it Saturday the vendor might not have had time to actually ship it Saturday. Which meant it probably shipped Monday. USPS Express mail is NOT guaranteed to be delivered the next business day, it can easily take two business days.

    Well, I talked to my friend who is a letter carrier, and she said that if it was sent from somewhere within 100 miles of an airport, and you are within 100 miles of an airport, it should be here 100% within in 1 day. It will tell u the same if u look on the USPS site.

    Ask him to give you a refund on shipping or provide a tracking number to you to prove when he sent it.  If he doesn't, then tell him he gets a 1/5 and tell him to blacklist you and me for giving you the advice.  I had a vendor banned and he "blacklisted" me with his account that was banned and his new account.  I don't know if anyone ever looks at it.  Once they see my stats with 42 purchases and 1 refund in the many months that I have been here, I don't know that they would even check.  If they do, just open a new account.  If vendors can do it, so can you.

    There IS a guarantee. Whether or not that guarantee is next business day or second business day depends on where it's starting out and where it's going and what time of day it was mailed. All of which can be checked easily at the usps website by entering both zip codes and date of mailing, information only the vendor would have.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It doesn't sound worth the hassle to offer express. At least not without a huge markup.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anywho to the OP don't leave bad feedback in this situation. Vendor did his part considering the saturday cutoff is usually so early and he actually shipped it the next business day.

    There's a way to resolve this Reggie.

    Tell the vendor your dissatisfaction in a NICE way and then don't buy from him again.

    First let me say i have a lot of experience with overnight and express shipping. Express is not guaranteed overnight. I believe its 2 days (might be 3).  Not, important thought.  The big piece of information lacking is what time Saturday did it get dropped off at the post office? was it even done at the post office or maybe just dropped in a mail drop box, or put it in his mailbox for the mail carrier to take, if he printed label from home?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But, lets just say for sake of argument that it was taken to the actual post office on Saturday.  What time was it dropped? (not what time did it get marked shipped on SR) When was it physically handed to the employee behind the counter?  If the package didn't make it to the post office early enough Saturday then your package dint go anywhere until Monday, since they are closed on Sundays.
