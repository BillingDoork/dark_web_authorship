    I've heard that 3 days or more is to long when waiting for package to clear customs. Should be flagged by then?

    What is your feelings on this?

    Usually if it sits there for over a month you should consider it gone.  But I've heard of people getting it past a month.  Sometimes it just sits there for a long time before it gets approved to go out.

    But what if it's shipped express from say...China? That is usually 4-5 days normally, right? So it should only sit in customs for a day or two before being shipped here in the US, correct?

    Are you talking about customs of the packages origin?  Are you asking is it normal for the package to sit in the customs of where it is coming from?  If so then definitely not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I thought you meant inbound customs.

    Yeah it's a crap shoot.  As you know, signature is required.  I've had some come through where they were left in the mailbox with no signature though. :o  Not very often though.  I can only guess that was due to lazy postal workers.  I am going to PM you some useful information on the subject of this exact mail route.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I forgot to mention, 5 - 8 business days from the package being sent to being delivered is the usual from my experience.  It also depends on where it was sent from in China, what customs it goes through and the destination in the US.  I don't know why some packages take three weeks to clear customs though, it happens, but it isn't common.
