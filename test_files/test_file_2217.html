    Yesterday in the mail I received about half a gram of white powder in a vacuum sealed bag from Europe. I don't think I should post the return address information to protect whoever did ship it, but it is really bothering me that I got it. I'm assuming it's a drug of some kind, but I have not made any orders from Silk Road (or any other clearnet website, for that matter) in several weeks. I only have like .01 BC on the account.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Furthermore, it's from a country I've never ordered from. There is no other identifying information other than the return address. It was sent through the US Postal Service in a plain white business envelope. The powder itself looks artificially white; not slightly yellow like some of the cocaine I've seen. It's very fine, no chunks and no moisture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm all for receiving free drugs, but I'm not touching it til I know what it is. Has this happened to anyone before? I have messaged all of the vendors I've done business with asking them about the specific return address. It really bothers me that someone I don't know has my address. Is this an issue I should bring up with SR Support?

    No dates on the post mark or anything to narrow down the date it was shipped? I've had a letter once arrive magically not knowing where it was from and turned out it was one of those "went missing must've been customs or I got scammed again" orders. It got here 3 months after I ordered it. I've even gotten a refund from the vendor in the meantime. I went and transferred the BTC back to the vendor, but even for them it was so long ago that they didn't remember me! :D

    One of your friends, least likely a vendor on here.... has sent an order through SR with your address as the delivery address.  Anybody can send anybody anything in the mail at anytime anyway, right? ................ riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?  ;)

    whatever it is, think about what could have happened. the coincidence just seems a little too big: you are on SR, and you "accidentally" receive a white powder package from a country you never ordered before? hm ...
