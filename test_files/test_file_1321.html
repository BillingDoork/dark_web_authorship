    I opened a box a month ago, not with the PO though. It's simply a photocopy that is made. The application form is sent to the USPS for confirmation. It is my belief that what they do with these is either A. Simply file it into a database or B. Confirm that the name and address on the form are real. So, with that in mind, look up an address in the phone book, and the name attached to it; make a fake ID based on that. But even then, you still may get screwed, because I'm not sure if they send your ID's # to the post office for verification either.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, the best way to find out anything is experimentation. I am very eager to hear how it goes. Even if you have problems, at least then we'll have an answer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try to ask as many questions as possible during the process - that's what I did. Don't seem suspicious; just seem interested. And when it comes to asking questions about what they send where, tell them you are worried and do not want your identity stolen (this is such a common problem, just look around tor), so you need to know exactly where they are sending your info and what they are going to do with it.

    There's no way for them to scan an ID to determine it's authenticity. (unless the ID is an obvious fake)  If your ID is scanned it's only to take down the info that's printed on the front (ie: name/address/DOB, etc.)  There's really no reason they'd need to scan it since you have to hand over the box application already filled out.   They will just photo copy both sides and place that in with your application and in all likelihood that will be the end of it.  A folder with your paperwork will be filed away and probably never again be looked at unless some issue with you or your box pops up down the road.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the way, wen you rent from an independent I'm nearly certain they are not necessarily required to send the paperwork into the USPS.  They are only required to collect the completed forms and ID documentation and have it available should postal officials request it.  You can learn more about this by looking up USPS Form PS Form 1583-A PDF

    What happens when they know you ordered drugs and had them delivered in your real name to your real address and they watch you open your mailbox and bring them into your house?  Tell me genius...how are you going to explain that?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An illegal pkg bearing one's actual name and address is a 100% slam dunk for LE.  An illegal pkg delivered to a nonexistent name to an address that cannot be traced back directly to you is by no means a slam dunk for LE.  If you are smart and take all the necessary steps to establish and maintain your anonymity you certainly stand a good chance of avoiding detection.  Contraband intercepted by LE bearing your name and address = nearly certain arrest.  Contraband intercepted by LE addressed to a name that is not yours addressed to box you rented anonymously = arrest not so certain.  Let's say the box renter does end up getting identified and picked up...sure, you might end up catching an additional charge having rented the box using false ID but in most cases that will be small potatoes compared to the serious time you may possibly be facing for a drug conviction.  When you label your illegal activity with your real name and address you stand no chance of staying out of the jackpot if LE decides to put you in it.   With only a fake name/address to go on they have a lot further to go if they want to pursue you. You are effectively forcing LE to make a decision whether they want to devote investigative and financial resources to identifying the anonymous box  holder.  Staking out a UPS Store requires precious LE manpower. There's no telling how long it may take or if it will even bear any fruit.  I'm guessing you'd have to be a fairly big fish for them to post round-the -clock surveillance on a mailbox for more than a day or two, if that.  When you closely consider the variables of each of the two scenarios side-by-side ...I'll take the fake ID box renter's odds every time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A few tips that come to mind on using PO Boxes...Don't pick up your mail immediately after delivery, let it sit for a few days.  Just about every drugs-in-the-mail bust I have ever read where the receiver was caught picking up from a PO or rented box...happened almost immediately after delivery was made.  They made LE's job of staking out their box a walk in the park.  LE  knows that most people getting drugs in the mail just can't wait to get their hands on the goodies.  This is another reason why using  Express delivery is such a bad idea.  You can't operate in this game safely if you are also impatient.  Common sense tells you the longer you put off pick-up the less likely you'll be under surveillance.   Of course, if they plant a tracker bug it won't matter how long you wait so it's a good idea to get rid of the packaging ASAP after picking up just in case your pkg did get bugged.  Also, pick up your mail late night/after business hours if possible.  It's much easier to get an idea if your box is being watched when it's late ..when few or no others are around.  A Crown Vic with government plates and  tinted windows parked alone in an empty parking lot will tend to stand out.
