    I see some vendors placing tracking numbers on their orders.
    <br/>
    I'm especially interested in how that goes in the netherlands?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What happens if the package gets seized? They can insert the tracking number and identify you immediately can't they? Or do you not have to give out any personal information?
    <br/>
    But even then, you are on a camera when ordering a tracking number so it will not be so hard for LE to track you down will they?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How to act if shipment gets seized for some reason?

    In my experience, yes you can ship something, International Express,  Registered International Mail, etc, etc(name varies on the country your from), which tracks the order at several points along the way. The sender is not required to give the postal service any ID to send it. Some countries may require a signature from the recipient but there are ways to use a name other than your own and still have no problem accepting delivery of the item from the post office.  :)

    Different countries work different ways.  Sometimes the sender hands a parcel to the clerk and there is a label or barcode of some type affixed to the parcel that is scanned into the computer.  This may have a date and time stamp as well so in effect if you (as a shipper) give out the tracking number, you are also telling someone the date and time that you shipped.  Now to take this info and apply it to the surveillance tape in the post office is elementary.  Scary shit if you are a shipper giving out a tracking number for a parcel that you mailed or that someone on your staff mailed.  Now I am sure some folks are going to call me crazy but keep in mind I am talking about CERTAIN COUNTRIES.  I did not say YOUR COUNTRY does this.  Some do and some may not.  Be careful!
