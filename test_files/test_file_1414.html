    A customer put an ex boyfriends name as the recipient on her address and the postman returned to sender because the name wasn't associated with the address.  The return address I use is not mine and will most likely end up in the hands of LE.  As a vendor, what should be my course of action now?  I know that I need to start using a different return address.  I suspect I will also completely change my stealth as well, so as not to resemble the letter in question.  Anything else?

    In addition to the precautions you've already stated, change your city drop point. LE will know which PO the letter originated from.

    Buyers should really be more attentive about these things. You really risk of endangering the vendor or at the very minimum cause him/her some unneeded trouble by revisiting everything.

    In this case the buyer was not the only one at fault. Vendors should not use the same return address twice. That should be changed every single time. I always save the return addresses on the packages I receive, and if I ever buy from a vendor who reuses it I immediately put him in my personal blacklist. What happens if LE gets a package w/o the vendor knowing? Well shit, now they can easily track and see every package the vendor sends. Its not hard to change the damn return address every time.

    Some vendors tie the type of package to the one of the return address (so that they can be plausible one to the other) and they have 2 or 3 of these different packages that they cycle. The only way LE can understand that's a faulty return address to begin with is if customs intercept the package and that happens only in the case the stealth is shit or the buyer mistake something (and guess what's the much more probable of the two?).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With a normal letter the chances customs will intercept the package is close to nil (to not say total nil, that with a good stealth is), so the only way for something like that to happen is, again, by buyer's fault. It's not asking so much to buyers to be attentive to whom the vendor will send the product, isn't it? I mean, it should be also in their interests, no?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For bulk orders the thing changes, but we are not talking here about this but of a simple letter (DMT product). Here the fault is only of the buyer.

    What if the vendor doesn't realize the buyer messed up though? The buyer might not ever let it be known. Or perhaps one seller wants to fuck over another seller and has something delivered to a LE's house. There are a lot of circumstances that could end up with LE having the return address without the vendor knowing. And once they have it they can obviously track the packages and cause trouble for us.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And as far as your points about the buyer, I agree completely. I didn't mean he/she was innocent. The buyer definitely shouldn't of used an ex boyfriends name

    I can throw the blame at the buyer all day, but realistically as a vendor, I should be ready for the fallibility of human logic.  For some reason, she thought that using an ex's name would give her plausible dependability or something.  I should just take this as a learning experience.  There are probably things I can do better.  Like changing my return address more often to keep one person's fuck up from affecting someone else who has the same return address.  I do however, always take into account that I could be sending a letter to LE, and I try to stay a few steps ahead in that regard.  Is there any advice you could give me in regards to the best choice for a return address, business or otherwise?

    Hey ringo I plan to start vending here and wonder do u just choose a random local return address and switch it often. If u prefer to not discuss it publicly please pm me trying to get all this information about shipping figured out before I start vending.

    Never knew how much a vendor had to do to stay safe and anonymous lot harder that it seems.
