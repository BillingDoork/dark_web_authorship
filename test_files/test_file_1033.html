    Hi,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't worry about it.  If it's borderline I'd be surprised if they didn't just deliver it anyway.  You are not the first person from SR where their package had incorrect postage or some other small mistake.  You would be surprised at the number of packages that are still delivered even with incorrect zip/postal codes, mispelled addresses and so on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your package isn't going through customs, so it isn't going to be subjected to the kind of inspection that customs packages go through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just keep in mind what you will read in the forums, time and time again, don't sign for anything that you weren't expecting to sign for.  If for any reason you do get a visit (which is highly unlikely, you are more likely to just get  a letter telling you they found restricted items in your package and it was destroyed) from someone asking about the package, deny, deny, deny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have a tracking number, check it from a computer other than one at your own home. Go to McDonald's or something.  The tracking should show you if there is a problem.

    Yeah no need to worry, edibles will look like normal food and people send that all the time.  Unless your friend has them in the original dispensary packaging which does label it for what it is.  But even then it will not smell like pot so there is no reason for the package to be opened.

    I once had a parcel from a legit business, that got the postage wrong.  Granted it wasn't illegal drugs, but postal guy left one of those peach slips for you to pick up at the post office...  I wondered why it wasn't just left in the mailbox since it wasn't supposed to be signed for.  Once I got to the post office, they just wanted the extra money for the postage.  I paid some change and was on my way.  Hopefully, if the postage was just short a little bit your post office will do the same.  They should NOT have you sign for it(don't sign anything), they just want their cut.

    You are thinking like they are out to bust you when actually they just want you to get your mail delivered.   Don't be so paranoid.   Yes be careful but also have some common sense is all people are saying.   And yes I agree about the postage thing......although you might need to change your underwear before you go pick it up.   RELAX.....you aren't expecting 100 grams of MDMA or anything.....it's just some cookies.

    As long as it was packed well their interest in the package should just  be for the postage due not for sending anything illegal so yes I think I would pick it up, but there would be some who might tell you not to bother with it.   Up to you.

    Actually, thinking back on it, I may have had to sign just to show that I came to pick it up.  I can't remember all that clearly, but if I did have to sign, it would have just been signing to "release" the package from my mail man since he had created a slip for it, not because it was certified or anything.  So, just being some pot cookies, I might at least attempt to go in and just see what's up.  If they do have you sign, it would be on the little Point of Sale thing where you would swipe a credit card.  I have had to sign on one of those for an international package and I think I might be mixing that time up with the time I had extra postage due.  In the end I can't remember if they had me sign for just having postage due or not.

    For just some pot cookies I would go pay the extra postage....it looks more suspicious to not pick it up if you ask me.  Most important thing is to not just think like a criminal.  They just want to get you your mail.

    If extra postage is due, they will just give you a pink notice in the mail saying as such, with the amount owed and will hold the package until you come pick it up from the counter with the extra postage in hand.  They won't chuck the package and they won't return it to the return address.  If it's just a matter of a few cents they will still ship it to you, you will just need to pay the extra.  This has happened to me a few times on SR orders...me being the buyer when someone isn't using flat rate postage.  It's also happened in real life just with general mail and packages as well, non SR related.  Not a big deal really...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please update us when it comes in!  You shouldn't have to sign for it though, I've never been asked to sign for a package due to postage.  Only reason you would be asked, is if the sender requests a signature.
