    Hey all, long time lurker first time poster.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So here's the deal. I opened a PO box with the USPS recently with my real name and ID, and whatever. Its to keep the shipments from my girlfriend, not to hide my identity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now here's the thing, when I opened it, as previously mentioned, I used my real name. However, upon inspection of the receipt the postal worker gave me when I opened my box, they got my name wrong! My last name is off by one letter. I mentioned it to the desk worker once I looked at my receipt, and they said "oh, its not biggie, your mail will (mumble mumble)". She made it sound like it wasn't a problem that it was off on the receipt, but also she was pretty darn lazy, so I suspect she may have just not cared.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Therefore, I'm not sure if that's simply the name printed on the receipt or the actual name on the box. The paperwork I filled out had my correct name on it, but when the worker entered the info from the paperwork into the computer, that's when it got screwed up. Not sure if the paperwork goes on to a higher-up who enters it fully into the system and the desk worker was simply charging me for the box, or if my info was put in right then and there by the desk worker.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since I don't know which name is technically on my box, I'm a little leary of ordering any packages until I find out. I don't want any packages to get lost or flagged because the name is off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Think there's any way this could actually play into an advantage for me? Or should I return to the Post Office to verify my name on the box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thoughts?
