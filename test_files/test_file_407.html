    I'm still waiting on something sent Express mail on Sat. 15th before the cut-off. Last update on USPS was that it left the sorting facility up North on Tues. 17th.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, last time I had something shipped priority and it didn't show that it was in my state until after I'd received it. But that was just a DCN, so I sort of expected that. Is Express mail tracking just as bad?

    Don't know exactly about Priority, but my mailman said Fedex handles USPS Express packages, and that they've had the normal issues for Christmastime, basically things can be delayed a day or two.  I had a Priority pkg take five days last week, they've always been delivered in two days before, so guess we just gotta be patient :/

    It's cool. I actually received my package today. So, Express shipping took 4 postal working days...won't be paying extra again for that, when I know that Priority gets to me from the same area in 3 at the most. Lesson learned!

    I haven't had any delays with my packages, Express is still coming overnight and priority is still coming to me on the 3rd day...but then I do live by a major airport and USPS sorting center so that might help.

    I wouldn't be too worried.  With the business at postal hubs your package could have simply fallen out of a bin, or been rerouted accidentally to the wrong distribution tube, in which case they'll just send it back down and start again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I regularly have to wait past the finalization deadline, usually 21+ days an i'm still 105/0.50% so don't let anyone tell you that just cuz you haven't got your order in 5 day's you're screwed.  Especially if it's international, it can sit in a customs sorting bin for days to weeks before they get to yours.

    Hey guys, I just wanted to let everyone know that I got an express package today that was later than usual, so the USPS is having issues with delays. I live in a rural area and express usually takes 2 days, but it is almost always here by the morning of the second day. Today, it got here in the late afternoon truck, which comes to the post office after the mailpeople have already made their rounds. So just hang tight, your packages are most likely coming, but a bit delayed! My small town post office was extremely busy today with all the mail they were getting. I even saw a UPS truck there, probably helping out USPS with all their mail...

    That seems about right.  I had a legal package shipped to me via USPS Critical Mail from the same city I live in, and it still took 3 days for me to receive. And I live near one of those hubs Festivalia mentioned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That being said, I'm currently waiting on a pack from the NL, at 16 days right now. My last pack from this vendor took 8. Not too worried at the moment - it'll get here when it gets here, no amount of rage will make it get here sooner. Just got to think positive and spark a bowl whenever my anxiety starts getting the better of me. ;)

    You also need to take in account the massive blizzard that blanketed the midwest in snow, and then the 40-50mph winds that came for 2 days afterwards that cancelled tons of flights. Dont know where u live but there are lots of shipping hubs in the midwest.

    The U.S. Postal Service expects robust online shopping to boost package shipping 20% over last year, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said Thursday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve is the Postal Service's busiest time of year. Mail carriers will deliver nearly 18 billion cards, letters and packages during that time, Donahoe said. The Postal Service projects it will process 658 million pieces of mail on Dec. 17 alone, 130 million more than it processes on an average day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Beginning Dec. 4, the National Operations Center will have staff working 24 hours a day to navigate mail movement around the world, including 30 million pounds of military mail destined for people serving overseas.

    All kinds of orders from this vendor have been received by tons of other people during the time I've been waiting. People who've ordered after me have gotten to enjoy their product already.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to keep seeing these great reviews for my shit that I KNOW is just sitting in a PO probably miles away from me right this second. Fuck.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I feel bad because I'm probably irritating the shit out of my vendor over something that's most likely the USPS's fault.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kids, don't ever get your heroin shipped First Class during the holidays. Opt for the more expensive shipping methods.

    My addiction is purely psychological. I'm just impatient. When I buy my drugs here, I want them ASAP.

    <br/>
    I got it into my head that I'd be getting high today, and now I'm disappointed due to getting my hopes up. Purely my own fault.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And if I could get anything locally in any form, I surely wouldn't be here jumping through hoops to get drugs.

    I wish it were that simple where I could just "go get some OP's", but sadly that isn't the case.

    Iv had all my mail come on time for the past 2 weeks no issues at all, even got a 1st class pack from Netherlands to USA in a little over a week, i couldn't believe it.. But now Im waiting on My fucking Benzo;s from Europe that I orderd Last week!! Not as in the week we were in but week before, Me nor my vendor are 100% what day it went out but im putting it at about 9 days or so maybe more waiting on a Priority mail pack.. It was a offer of samples from a Very reputable vendor who just happen to get a new brand and no one has bought or giving review so He offerd to send me some plus a few xtra of his other benzos for a full review on them.. So all my damn drugs have come in except my Benzos which at this point Id rather have my methadone and Xanax over anything these days. Best feeling hands down.. Yea a good bag of H is good when u can find it but Iv gotton dependent on Benzos and they are not fun to be without either after a few years of taken them.. Im guessing its the Holidays.. Took a Priority from POLAND 14 days but FFS i thought Europe would be way faster/ Hoping for Monday!!! My luck My shit im not needing will come ..lol

    this time of year I found was the best time to order specially internationally.  I find that though the package takes longer to get here from thanksgiving through about middle of January everything comes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then all of a sudden from Jan 15th to March 10-15th or so is when I would get almost everything seized and letters sent and after march 15th everything seemed to go back to normally  this has happened to me for the past 3 years. so I dont order during that time. It could just be me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My assumption is its the new year and customs has a quota but I could be totally wrong.

    Anyone else experience this?

    Going through a vendor outside of sr to a PO box. They say it should have arrived before christmas but I was wondering if the delays are the same for po boxes since they don't have to travel an extra piece for resiedntial delivery? How would the post office warn you if the package was rejected or something went wrong?

    It will still be a big delay.  The issue is not simply getting it from your local post office to your house, it is all of the processing facilities between and the sorting of all the mail that is slowing them down.

    Yeah I had an order from Canada to US which is delayed and naturally I start to worry. It normally takes 7 days for this vendor. It's now been 10 and no show, but of course a couple of those days were Christmas Eve and Christmas, plus Sunday, so who knows? I always worry when things take longer than usual but it generally works out in the end. When you get something shipped at this time of year, you have to expect delays.

    Actually Fred, it was yours, but it arrived today so no worries there. Like I said, probably delayed because of the holiday, that's out of your control. Thanks for checking in though. So if anyone is panicking, you can probably rest easy. My package took about 4 days longer than usual but it did arrive safe and sound. I expect yours will as well.

    just checked tracking (outside of TOR).. best news ever! seems like USPS is back to work.. ive been getting alot of stuff quite fast and on time or ahead of schedule this entire december.., maybe i live near a major sort facility or usps really stepped up their game this season..  its in the other half of the state.. i can expect it tomorrow no later than Saturday.. wow! That was fast! will be 5 days from marked in transit if it gets here tomorrow!.. =)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Look fwd to just using you from now on, waiting on those european packs cause me too much anxiety especially without tracking.. please keep those ounces listed.. took me awhile to finally be able to purchase after just trying a gram of Gelman's as my first SR purchase several months ago..
    <br/>

    happy new year and birthday to me!

    Now I'm sick this weekend for sure. This sucks bad! I wish I had an IRL connect for H. I tried the old spots I used to go to on the street in downtown Denver 10 years ago, but no one was out. It's cold as fuck out here.
