    Hello everyone.
    <br/>
    Trying to stay optimistic here but so many sketchy things have been happening with one package I ordered from a 100% vender with 200+ transactions and very happy customers. Had one experience before with this vendor and the packaging is as good or even better than the other handful of vendors I have used.
    <br/>
    I just can't hold back not to post anymore because USPS seems to be very sketchy with this package. It's making me nervous.
    <br/>
    First off the package was sent late Oct right before a certain "super storm". I suppose due to this, the package was delayed a good amount of time. The vendor saw that I didn't get the package yet to they handed me the DCN about a week after shipment.
    <br/>
    We saw it was stuck in a sorting facility near him. By doing some research I found (assume) that the sorting facilities were holding back packages due to the storm until PO re-opened.
    <br/>
    A couple days ago I got happy because the package moved to around my area. Then finally a day later moved to my town.
    <br/>
    Then it got really sketchy.
    <br/>
    First it said "Out for Delivery"
    <br/>
    (Checked, but no delivery was made the whole day)
    <br/>
    Then 14 hours later (automatically) it said "Delivery Status Not Updated"
    <br/>
    It said this for a while. Then finally after this in the morning it said "Notice Left". Funny thing is too that when it said "Notice Left" the stamped time date was updated in reality at 11:30am but online it says the marked time was 9:30 if you know what I mean.
    <br/>
    Under the tracking number it says this:
    <br/>
    "www.usps.com/redelivery or calling 800-ASK-USPS, or may pick up the item at the Post Office indicated on the notice. If this item is unclaimed after 30 days then it will be returned to the sender. Information, if available, is updated periodically throughout the day. Please check again later."
    <br/>
    So far in total from shipment of seller its been over 3 weeks (But remember that storm definitely had to delay things)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ANYONE have an experience like this? Still didn't check my box today but probably will at some point to see whats really in there.
    <br/>
    All I know is I know nothing!  :-X
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But really any advice is appreciated. If there really is a notice for me to get it think I'm just gonna call the game to an end for me unfortunately. Still can't see how this vendors packaging messed up, but I'm also thinking it could be that a PO worker thinks I did something strange or flagged my box.
    <br/>
    Thinking the worst but hoping the best!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    EDIT/UPDATE:
    <br/>
    Everything went just fine. Thank you all for the comments and reassurance! For future reference to others I will lock the topic and say what happened. I think it was an automatic clock punch that made it say "Notice left". I think that they had a backup of deliveries and couldn't deliver on the date they should of. Therefore, the tracking automatically updated to notice left but in reality no notice was left. It was just delivered the next day. No problems.  ;D

    If you have an notice to pick it up then go pick it up. If it wont fit in the box you can get a notice. Never worry about chasing time on USPS website. It updates and you cant count on that all the time. Do you have the notice they left you? If you do, then go get your package. Nothing to worry about! You are reading way to much in to it. Just go get the package. Did you use a fake name or something?

    Thanks for the reply! Thing is there's no way the package can't fit in my po box. I feel that can't be the reason because the vendor stated the dimensions of the package and I could probably fit about 5 of them in my PO box if you really tried. Small order so definitely small package. Plus I have a well sized PO box that could fit small boxes let alone bubble envelopes.
    <br/>
    I did not go get the notice yet actually. I know I may be jumping the gun here but I'm sure you all understand the paranoia that lurks aside with ordering from SR. I'm gonna grab the notice in a couple of hours, got 24 hour access and rather go and read the notice without having a worker right by the counter.
    <br/>
    Did not use any fake names or bs like that.
    <br/>
    I'm hoping it's just backed up from this crazy ass storm we had and they want customers to pick it up. Don't think we got packages for 2-3 weeks (so imagine being a po worker trying to stuff all them backed up packages in po boxes) maybe thats why they want me to pickup.
    <br/>
    Or also hoping they just hit the wrong scanning button and really delivered it!
    <br/>
    I'll keep everyone updated. Wish me luck.

    What is the worst outcome you are fearing?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    do you think the USPS employee is going to lean over the counter and grab your wrists while calling out for help from a burly guy sorting mail?
    <br/>
    or do you think they've assigned two cops to watch the post office, for days on end, hoping you might turn up clutching your slip of paper?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Paranoia I understand. But it has to be logical scenarios. What is the scenario you're thinking of.

    USPS handles somewhere in the vicinity of 600,000,000 pieces of mail DAILY.  That's six-hundred MILLION.  I can't begin to imagine how many people each day receive the very same notice you have alleged to receive regarding missed delivery...probably hundreds of thousands??  Anyway the point is the chances of your missed delivery having anything to do with the pkg contents are slim to none.  Go pick up your pkg OR schedule a redelivery online at https://redelivery.usps.com/
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PS  The only question I have is why wasn't the mail carrier wasn't able to leave the pkg.  Were you expecting a big pkg?  Or was it Express?  Unless a signature was required the mail carrier usually do everything they can to find a spot to leave it.

    Notice Left is nothing out of the ordinary.
    <br/>
    Tracking acting retarded is nothing out of the ordinary. If anything they will give you clean tracking if they are trying to snag ya.
    <br/>
    Tracking numbers cause more problems then they solve it seems.
    <br/>
    The building I live at NEVER gets any delivery attempts .. they just write up the stack of Notice Left slips and stick them on or in the mailboxes then drop their bins off at the local pickup spot.

    Sounds like paranoia mostly, not that you shouldn't be paranoid. DCN's can be screwy sometimes, I would recommend checking the DCN less often. It seems to me checking the DCN dozens of times would draw more suspicion than anything.
