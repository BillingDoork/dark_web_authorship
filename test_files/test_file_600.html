    I keep reading the forums but can't get a good consensus of the safety of using silk road. Most of the forums seems to be people in Europe/Aus and are ordering MDMA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was wondering if anyone has any experience/anecdotal evidence or advice on ordering coke domestic in the United States (~1g) ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was just wondering whether even such a small amount if caught would be followed up?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks

    for 1g? I don't think so. Maybe 1g of crystal LSD then yeah you would likely be followed up but not coke.

    There was a long thread that pine started, where she collected data from many vendors on their shipping success rates. The overall success rate was 96.5%, so 3.5% of packages are seized, but that doesn't tell the whole story, because it mixes international and domestic stats, along with stats from different countries. We know Australia has a high interception rate, for example, and we know that international orders are seized much more often than domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For personal amounts like that, the chances of a seizure are less than 1% domestic.

    I'm not even worried about seized if all they do is seize it and confiscate it...

    I'm just a young professional and worried about further litigation....

    I'm originally Canadian and I miss Canada... the laws here in the US are so frightening... minimum 5 years for a schedule I drug?

    With no prior criminal history, you likely won't do more than probation / drug court for a personal amount, but the drug conviction can fuck a lot of shit up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, they are unlikely to do a controlled delivery on a personal amount.

    USA drug laws are scary as shit, but hey it could be worse, you could be living in Singapore. They hang your ass over there over certain quantities of illicit goodies. Fucking sick bastards.

    I mean if you would give a little more info you could get a more straight forward answer. For example. Did you order 1 gram domestic and are waiting an unusual amount of time? or whats the backround your just asking "what if, if SR is a safe enough place"?
    <br/>
    With 1 gram of coke domestic. it would take one sloppy vendor to get seized i mean it could happen but that would blend in with small mail. Not really what they are looking for. so
    <br/>
    but lets look at the worst. If you did order and it did get caught up the chances of a controlled Delivery are unlikely and the only way your getting in trouble is if you tell on your self or sign and open it. I mean there are sooo many forums and threads on this subject maybe not for specifically a gram of coke but for small amounts and the norm
    <br/>
    ITs like this clean computer. clean house. and DENY if ever confronted! and you have nothing to worry about over a gram of coke, I mean none of us would like that on or rap sheet even as strike one but you got to know the basics before you order!
    <br/>
    good luck man
    <br/>

    As long as you take the normal precautions, order domestically, and from a vendor with a good reputation. You should be fine. :)

    Theres always a risk you gotta take, the risk is lower if you're ordering domestic and I think you would be fine ordering 1g of coke. I've successfully gotten coke to Canada from the US and the stealth wasn't even the best.

    Haha it is scary making your first order, we've all been there.

    The probability of a small package getting intercepted in the us mail is almost nill.you have a better chance of a mailman or mail clerk intercepting it for themselves then a postal inspector getting it. I mean come on if you were a mailman and like to party and found a gram of coke in the mail YOU WOULD KEEP IT AND NOT TURN IT IN.

    Depends too on how stealthy the packaging is. I've not used this site to buy coke so I can not comment on which coke vendors are the most stealthy.  But pPharm and LunaC  are the two most stealthiest domestic US vendors I've come across yet but they do not sell coke.
