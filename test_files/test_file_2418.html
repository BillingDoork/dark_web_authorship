    Hi SR,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I understand the general consensus of shipping your goodies to vacant rental homes and stuff is a no no. But with the amount of apartment buildings around and that some are vacant, what about shipping to an empty apartment mail box, like these ones (image ---&gt;) http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=5e671c0c8190a1c3b7fc8cb438d8fbfb.jpg
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wondering if its worth investing in a 'master' key like this? http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/57acd49a90
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just want to see peoples thoughts on this..

    try it out with a drug free package sent from another country. They might have a list of used and non used boxes. Also make sure once you pick up the package block any possible tracking signals and take it somewhere other than your residence like a fast food restroom, check the package to make sure product is still their and everything, dispose of packaging down restroom toiled and return home. Make sure you have counter survey the box the day of delivery from around 7 am to delivery time. If some one just drops of your package with no other mail dont pick it up.

    Your mailperson is very aware of who's occupying that address. They even usually mark the last names here in the US on a label and stick it in the back of the mailbox to keep track of things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advice would be if you're going to do this to get a few pieces of "normal" mail delivered first. Or file a fake change of address form...

    One other tip is use quick shipping methods to your advantage. If something should arrive in 2 days and after 5 days its not arrived chances are its been picked up by customs and is being transfered to LE.

    Yep, yep, all good info.
    <br/>
    In aus, I'm led to believe that there is no connection between the address and the name when it comes to mail. So mailmen just drop mail wherever its address to, doesn't matter who it is addressed to really.

    Just remember, if you're caught doing that, especially with a master key, you're going to be looking at far more trouble than just ordering a couple grams of crank. Only you can assess the situation and judge your safety but, personally, I would not do that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    *edit: I will say though, I spend several months a year in a vacation condo. I'm not rich but, these are for people who can afford to drop 500k on a second condo. (not me, that's for sure). That said, many owners don't show up but for 2-3 months out of the year. It's a community type atmosphere, about 30 units, small enough to know what the deal is. It would be very easy to order to one of those addresses, knowing that whoever owns  215 is away in a different state and wont have renters for the next 3 weeks.  All of the boxes are in one central location. The community is quiet enough and the MailBox's in a private enough location that in this situation, I might feel comfortable ordering to one of those addresses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Provided the mail is not forwarded (usually it isn't, allowing monthly renters to receive mail), this might be a decent option.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To me though, having a postal key on you is not going to look good to the guy in the black robe behind that funny bench, probably even worse to the 12 of your peers who must decide your fate ;-)
