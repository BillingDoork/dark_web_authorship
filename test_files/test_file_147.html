    the chances of it being seized are probably about 1 in 1000 zillion. EU to EU post isn't subject to customs:

    http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_for_goods/free_movement_goods_general_framework/index_en.htm
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the chances of a controlled delivery being organised for that tiny amount of drugs, in the UK, are probably around 1 in 700 gazillion.

    chill.

    crystal meth has a serious stigma about everywhere at the moment here so i could see customs or local le getting a serious hard on for even such a small amount.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also im certain that absolutely everything coming into the uk or
    <br/>
    any other eu country is subject to routine inspection by customs, no escaping that i think, just the luck of the draw. wish it wasn't the case and i could agree with u.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    my reason for slight nervousness is that over the last 2 yrs ive had a few no shows followed by multiple successes
    <br/>
    without ever receiving a ll which makes me wonder is someone subtly building a case against me. surely if any of the previous no shows were actually seizures then id be on a watch list by now and id have had no further successful deliveries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    none of my no shows which were from reputable sources have ever been explained, ie no ll, nothing.
    <br/>
    ive about an 80% success record which means 1 in 5 is prob ending up in the hands of someone id rather not

    You have to factor in that a CD is still not a solid conviction. So they could use many hours of police time planning and executing it, then put you in the legal system, wasting the judges time over 1g which you wouldn't even go to jail for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you think you're address has been compromised with reasonable evidence, use your best judgement and stop shipping to it.

    Possibly UK &amp; Ireland are slightly different but EU to EU normally does not involve customs. This is law, not just an agreement amongst countries.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, you're thinking way too much on this mate. Even if it got stopped, they probably wouldn't even know it was meth (very rare in the UK) until they sent it to a lab, then on top of that the resources they'd have use to go to investigate you for something they most likely could never prosecute you for would be huge. If it got stopped they'd most likely just send you a letter and a warning. I see from a thread set up by some Irish buyers, that is what happens there.

    thanks again for the replies.

    im probably overthinking it at this stage is true.
    <br/>
    even though ive never had a love letter before for any of my no shows, im going to consider the address burnt for now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a love letter this time would nearly put me at ease so at least i knew what happened, no love letters ever is what fueled my paranoia.
