    Hi all, first time poster but long time member of SR (1 year+). Made about 30 transactions, many of them fairly large (4oz+ of weed and 100+ MDMA pills) without a delay or interception, until November when a large order from Canada to the UK from the most highly rated weed vendor on the Road did not arrive, and the tracking showed it had stalled at the international mail depot. I didn't receive a loveletter so I assumed it was merely lost/stolen in the post. I made a few small orders from the UK all of which arrived successfully, then made a large order from a well-regarded vendor in the Netherlands in December which also didn't arrive, the tracking showing it had stalled in the sorting office in the Netherlands. Again, no loveletter from customs so I assumed it was safe to continue using the address. However, I made two smallish orders from EU countries a week ago and they still have not turned up, which is unusual as postage from EU-&gt;UK usually arrives within the week. Assuming these orders don't turn up in the next week, is it safe to assume my address is flagged/watched by customs and to look into alternative arrangements?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    tl;dr two large international orders failed to arrive with no customs letter, is my address safe?

    How is anybody supposed to answer that? Unless what you're looking for is pure conjecture. With that being the case, I'll bite. No, your address is not safe. No address is safe. All you can do is minimize risk, for example order domestically.

    Of course, I don't expect anyone here to know definitively, all I'm looking for is an educated guess based on the experience of the posters here, which taken as a whole I can use as a basis to form my own best judgement. I already order domestically, but I'm concerned about losing money and also ruining my buyer stats if my address is indeed flagged by customs and further international orders don't make it.

    But wouldn't that only prove that domestic mail is still getting to the address, not international inbound?... and even if you do receive it I would double check that it has definitely not been opened and contents checked, then cleared for delivery.

    So can someone answer the following question at least? (i guess it depends on the country) but if one package gets seized by customs, would they put a red flag on your address and/or name, therefore making sure to thoroughly check each package sent to that address hence?

    I would consider the address flagged.   Two large international packages inbound to that address that haven't showed?  Why take your chances.   Don't use it for international for awhile, if ever again.

    Well as long as we're allowed to speculate...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I imagine if customs finds a package of drugs addressed to you that your address will go on a "watch list" database that will automatically flag for careful inspection of any future shipments.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seems pretty likely anyway.

    This debate will continue to get discussed for ever and a day and there must be one or two new threads created daily asking regarding address flagging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my country it would seem one or sometimes even two no shows to an address may not result in anything happening (flagging) and an o/s intercept may not affect you ordering domestically again either. But seriously, you claim to have had two large o/s orders with tracking clearly get intercepted and you are wondering if it is safe to continue to use that address? what does your gut tell you?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Truth is nobody really knows what capabilities customs have when it comes to monitoring addresses but it stands to reason if they intercept a large order or more than one then they will be logging that on a register somewhere and it is quite probable that they do have the capability to 'flag' that address to screen what else gets sent there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One intercept should be all you need to consider that address dead, change up and move on and above all stay safe.

    My gut says 'never use this address again', but in my experience UK customs always send out a loveletter if they intercept an illicit package while if it was discovered by Royal Mail, they would have involved the police immediately. Strangely, one of the orders arrived today, which adds yet more confusion to an already cloudy situation. I'm tempted to write it off as far as further int'l orders go to be honest.

    Always trust your gut mate, if the missing orders were large even if one has now strangely shown up you still have one no show, unless you very strongly suspect foul play by the vendor i.e. was never sent then I would be changing my drop arrangements.

    No , addresses cant be flagged as they are not kept in a computer , the mail man will make the delivery and thats all .

    an address can be flagged only by coming out and arresting you after you have been warned once , cause once you get warned they keep you in the computer .

    I'm not sure what country you're posting from and it may well be different where you live but in the UK addresses definitely do get flagged by customs if they find contraband being posted to your address. It's not like an alarm will go off or something every time a package for that address goes through customs but it does mean a record is kept.
