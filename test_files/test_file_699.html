    If a package were to get nicked by LEA in transit, what would the tracking say?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there any situation where tracking/dcn would say delivered, yet the package had not arrived?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...or are these non-finalizing twatginas giving each other hot Carls while I bust my ass to get their packages out same or next day. Is it that hard to click a few buttons? Correct me if I'm wrong here.

    It won't say anything other than what it said on the last check point.
