    Hello SR,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm pretty new to this all, I've read the buyer's guide and specifically the section of receiving packages. The thing is, I know here, they won't deliver mail unless it has the correct name. The reason I know this is because I once wrote down a pseudonym as my real name and the mailman didn't know any "Harold Hunt"s in the area. He found this suspicious. I also don't have any friends who would receive the package for me. Having some experience with receiving orders in my area, signing seems to be mandatory. If you aren't there, he will stick a sticker saying "Delivery failure notice" or something like that on your door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So my question is: Noting the details I've given, what is the best way to receive a package that needs to be signed for?
    <br/>

    One of the golden rules of this site is never sign for anything. So buy from someone who doesn't require you to sign for it.

    Hello,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How do I know if a package needs to be signed for? Why would something need signing anyway (other than for an arrest)?

    Registered Post and Express Post Platinum are just a couple of services available from Aust. Post which requires a signature upon delivery. I use them quite a bit, especially Internationally, as it virtually ensures confirmation of delivery. There are ways of getting around having to sign for a delivery that actually requires one. Where I live, the postie will leave you a card to pick up your item from your local Post Office if he doesn't get an answer when he knocks. There is an option of nominating another person to collect the order on your behalf and to do so, you can sign this note at home with a fake name, and just drop off the signed note to the person behind the counter and collect the item. Obviously there are details I have left out but at the end of the day, where there is a will, there will always be a way. If you use professional vendors who have proven their methods mostly arrive, stick with them and continue supporting them. Packaging is the key to an item arriving and a vendor's ability to "reinvent the wheel", so to speak, with their packaging techniques/methods/materials is key to successful International deliveries. :)
