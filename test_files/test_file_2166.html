    I'm in the US, and have a weird thing going on.  This entire week I have not received any actual mail.  I did get a package I ordered from Amazon which was left at my doorstep, and a small package from India (with some non-illegal meds) that I had to pick up at the post office.  I usually at least get a grocery store flier and coupons on Tuesdays, but I've had zero junk or important mail come in all week.  I am expecting a letter from a vendor, so I'm worried that the fate of that letter is with the rest of my mail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anybody have any experience with something like this?  I'm paranoid about actually calling the post office to inquire about it in case they flagged my address or something.

    Trancesend, you said it yourself in your post. I think your being a little paranoid!! (or maybe a lot!) Just cause you haven't received a grocery store flier, some coupons and some junk mail this week doesn't, in my opinion, equate to any suspicious activity happening at your place of residence. Were you expecting some important mail to arrive which is unrelated to anything from here on SR? There are a bunch of reasons which could explain why those items you mentioned didn't arrive this week, however your talking about fliers, coupons and junk mail which hasn't arrived for all of one week, If they were holding your mail, your packages from Amazon and India wouldn't have showed or been delivered and they would be sitting with the other important letters, fliers, coupons and junk mail supposedly held by the authorities. You need to chill a little and take a second look at the situation cause in my opinion, you have nothing to be worried about. :)
