    I checked my mail today after ordering from a reputable vendor. Instead of the package being in the mailbox, there was a pink slip that is telling me to pick up the package at the post office tomorrow - not today. At the top of the slip is says "Sorry We Missed You! We (Re)Deliver for you". I'm scared, not sure what to do. Every other package has been successful.

    I wouldn't go back.. That is extremely odd and I remember reading on this forum they put those same pink slips in Colorado when they did a bunch of weed busts there. Have you ever had to sign for it?  This is an easy way for law enforcement to get you to come to them.  I personally would take it as a loss and move on brother.  It must be a significant amount.  They wouldn't do a controlled delivery for a few grams.

    I've had it happen with drugs and normal items. They do that if you weren't there to sign when signature was required or sometimes if it is larger than the postbox.

    It's just a piece of mail, and you don't fucking know what's in it, do you? Just go get it. Isn't it more suspicious that the post office is holding a package that the dude apparently doesn't want anymore?

    Happen to me before also, but it's only because this vendor put a QP in a huge box, when others put it in a box which fits iinside my mailbox.

    I agree with you, this will just make the OP look even more suspicious. Did you have any other packages that you know of that were coming from somewhere other than SR?

    Wow... So as I was leaving the apartment, i noticed the key missing from the large box holder. I checked my mailbox and it was there... Why would they put the note in there? My only thought is that they put it on the wrong truck.

    This. These slips are pretty innocuous, and I agree that picking it up is less shady than abandoning it. I used to get these all the time when I lived in an apartment for stuff they couldn't fit into my mailbox. Just bring it to the post office and they'll go in the back and pull it for you. No signature should be necessary. You could just act like you don't know what it is. "Ooooh, I wasn't expecting this. I wonder if someone sent me a present" and disavow knowledge that you knew what it was.

    9 out of 10 times the reason you'll find the pink slip in your box instead of the pkg. is that it wouldn't fit.  Of course, the exception is if it required signature.  Going to pick up the pkg is not your only option.  You can request re-delivery online ...just make sure there is someone there to receive.

    Agree with the last poster, it will almost definitely be an oversized package that didn't fit in your mailbox.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the package was intercepted, you would've received a customs letter instead of the post office one, no?

    The package showed up in my mailbox 30 minutes later. Like I said earlier, I'm not sure what exactly would cause there to be a pink slip in there because there is a big (I mean huge, it can easily fit multiple packages in it) mailbox that is below mine that when there is a package, they lock that box and put the key in my mailbox to unlock it. That's usually how it works and it ended up like that in the end.

    yah i would pick it up. i have gotten those slips before, sometimes the i go there to get it and the package would have fit into my mailbox. i have no idea why they made me go get it. those slips are way to uncontrolled for it to be LE. there not going to have an officer waiting there all day incase you show up. if i really felt nervous about it, i would just pay some random 20 bucks to pick it up
