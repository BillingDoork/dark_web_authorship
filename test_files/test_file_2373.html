    I know there's been a lot of posts about this - home address vs. rented mailbox etc. From everything I've read, to get busted when shipping items to your house, you basically need to get busted in a controlled delivery, or some situation where they're staking you out and you get busted right after you accept the package. It seems like as long as you're observant, NEVER sign for anything and make sure no one's around when you get the package, I don't really see any real risk there. I've considered renting a mailbox with a fake ID, it's more anonymous but it just seems riskier. Getting stuff sent to your home, they basically need to bust you through a CD or with possession charges (which, if you're careful, you should be able to easily avoid), but if you get caught renting a box with a fake ID plus getting drugs shipped there, now you're royally screwed as there's no plausible deniability plus you have felony mail fraud charges to deal with. Thoughts?

    PO box even with a Fake ID is no more safe then your home when it comes to a CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Police can always stake out your PO box. Then when you get busted, you have even more charges against you.

    You need to consider how much you are ordering. For personal amounts, say a gram of speed, its highly unlikely that the cops would spend the money on a controlled delivery to bust you, the WORST that could happen is you would get a misdemeanor possession charge if you had it delivered to your house. If they intercepted the package and it was a small amount of contraband, they would send you a letter and put you on a watch list but its unlikely you would get any charges against you unless you continued to order stuff. If you set up a fake PO box, now when they intercept your package they might find out its fake information and now they will probably investigate you. Unless of course your ID is actually a real person and you just stole their identity, then that person will get a visit, and it becomes a identity theft case and now they start looking at security footage and really trying to find you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMO, its dangerous to set up a fake PO box unless you can really do it right for personal amounts of drugs. If you are ordering large amounts to sell, then you really need to step up your game meaning you have a PO box or even an address registered to a real person, but not you, and everytime you impersonate that person you wear full disguise (fake beard, sunglasses, and a wig under a hat that is the opposite color of your real hair and your ID matches how you look disguised. Also you need to stake out every delivery before going in to claim a package. Your best bet is to disguise up and pay a homeless guy to retrieve your package if possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another good strategy is to rent a cheap apartment near a university and use fake info and pay in cash. These apartments usually have multiple people living in them and the residents change every year or two so the post office is used to seeing mail addressed to many different people arriving there. This is of course expensive and meant for those importing large quantities for resale, or you can go in on it with a group of friends that need a drop off place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So in summary:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When ordering small personal amounts of drugs, its unlikely that you will be caught if you deliver to your home address, and if you do get caught the charges will be minimal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For larger operations, you need to step it up and be prepared to invest some real money.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    RETURN TO SENDER:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This method is iffy. The idea is that if it is a controlled delivery, they wait for you to accept the package and open it so they can bust you for possession. When you get you package, immediately write return to sender on it in red marker and dont open it for a day. If they were to bust you it would happen within an hour after you accept the package. By writing return to sender you can say that you weren't expecting the package and it was a mistake that it was delivered to you, so you wrote return to sender and planned on sending it back without even opening it. I'm not sure how this holds up in court, but it has to be better than getting caught red handed. If this happened to me, I would say "I did not order anything and the package looked suspicious so I wrote return to sender and planned on going to the post office tomorrow to explain to them the situation."Â  Ever since the anthrax attacks and the bombs that were mailed to US officials its perfectly understandable for people to be suspicious of packages that they did not expect. Anyone can send anyone drugs in the mail without their consent or knowledge. As an added touch, you can call family members and ask if they sent you a package, when in court you can point to those phone calls and they can verify that you did indeed call and ask about being sent a package. Fight circumstantial evidence with more circumstantial evidence, you are innocent until proven guilty!
