    So, I had 7 grams of marijuana delivered to my post office box about a month ago, and everything went smoothly without a problem. Haven't had a package delivered there since then. But, I haven't had any other mail delivered there either. Would it be suspicious to have another marijuana package sent there since there isn't any other mail coming in at the moment?

    I highly doubt there would be any issue.  At least in regards to you not getting any mail there since then.  The issues really only seem to arise if you ordered from a sloppy vendor who sends a stinky package or a suspicious looking package that peaks the curiosity of the postal workers.  But that would happen irregardless of you getting mail or not and is out of your control.  Just sit back, try and relax and I'm sure you'll be receiving your bud in no time without issue.  For the future though I'd try to have mail sent there on the regular.  Not only will it look more legit. but the person in charge of the PO boxes will know your name and there will be less chance of them messing up the delivery to your box.  Do keep in mind people use PO boxes just for delivery of packages because they don't want to risk having it stolen at their residence so there's nothing suspicious about what you're doing.  Rest easy!

    Don't worry. If it's domestic, and you know the vendors stealth is at least halfway adequate, you will be fine. I once had a PO Box for 2 months and had over 20 drug packages go to it, many of which did not fit and I had to sign for. Some were even international. What's important is your vendor knows what their doing stealth wise.

    no,it would definitely not arouse suspicion.But if you are feeling paranoid, order items of a online store now and then,it will help ease you in to having a more active PO Box. Good luck !!
