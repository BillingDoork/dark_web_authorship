    Ok, so I have been around here a couple of months; made a few small transactions. I'm in uk and they've all been domestic. All of them came the next day.
    <br/>
    I used several different vendors.
    <br/>
    Early last Friday I made another small order (3-4BTC) to a vendor I'd used before. Hoping it would arrive sat or mon. However vendor didn't respond until late sat said he would post on Monday. On the Friday I had offered to FE even tho I didn't need to (if he'd post quickly. )However on the Monday he asked me to FE for shipment. I had no problem with this due to previous transactions.
    <br/>
    It never arrived. I waited till thurs and messaged. He replied if it wasn't there to morrow he'd reship. Very helpful I thought. However it didn't arrive (the original package I mean) and he hasn't replied to my single message since.
    <br/>
    This thread isn't really to complain about vendor. I FE'd willingly and so have no cause for complaint. I guess it's possible he selective scammed me, it would probably make more sense to do the odd small amount from customers who trust you already. Maybe he is planning to quit soon and is maximising his income. His feedback does seem to have mostly "FE'd by request" and a couple of " didn't arrives". ( it was fine before the weekend I'm not that daft!) however I could be slandering a perfectly decent vendor( which is why I'm keeping this vague)
    <br/>
    Alternatively my small package has disappeared in transit. Again I'm not too concerned. I cant exactly see police giving a shit about such a small amount. Possibly a light fingered royal mail employee. Although most packages have been indistinguishable from normal letters or eBay shit. Or maybe it just got lost.
    <br/>
    What I am thinking about is whether to use this address again. It's not my home address. I can't use that.
    <br/>
    So if I want to continue to use SR it's this address or nothing. Its a useful drop... I dont want to go into detail. But do these things get flagged.?
    <br/>
    It's pissing me off as I have no way of knowing which of above possibilities is true. I was hoping to do an order from EU next for higher quality.
    <br/>
    I can make another small order from a different UK vendor. If it doesn't come too then obviously this let's me know address is no longer useful  for whatever reason ,hopefully without causing me legal difficulties.
    <br/>
    If it comes, great, but my mind isn't totally set at rest. My address could still be flagged I suppose and 'they' whoever they might be could be waiting for me to try something bigger.
    <br/>
    I'm not one of these paranoids who think the LE are gonna stake out my mail; I really can't see that happening over such trivial amounts. On the other hand I don't want to be needlessly reckless.
    <br/>
    I' d just like some other perspectives about whether to continue to use this address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously I won't be FEing in future. I have kind of been acting as if this encourages the vendor to ship... Got that totally backwards now I think of it.

    I have similar wonders, weirdly missing packages..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    out of 10+ of my total orders, 4 packages never showed up. all from big/trusted/popular vendors, all pretty small amounts (like 1g mdma, 5tab lsd, .5g meth..)
    <br/>
    I have had drugs in the mail several times after the ones that didnt show so guess my address isn't flagged. . .
    <br/>
    also, I have ordered cannabis seeds before that has been stopped by customs, then I'd get a letter notifying it was stopped the same day as the package was expected.
    <br/>
    Also I had weed sent in the mail before, that took almost 2 months before I heard anything from the time i expected the package, but I did hear something-  the 4 packages Im missing from here is 2-4+ months ago now and Im yet to hear anything..
    <br/>
    Also the weed that was stopped was to the same address, 1 year after it was stopped its not a problem ordering more drugs to the same address so if my address ever got flagged cos of that I guess its not flagged anymore..
    <br/>
    I tried bugging 1 vendor about missing package and asked if they could make sure it really was sent incase of some weird mishap on their end, but said after 1 month they couldnt tell any more..  I didnt wanna bug them before after a while anyway incase it wasnt their fault (if it was stopped by customs and I was awaiting a letter from customs) so consider those lost, I dno what happend to it but Im not ordering from those vendors again anyway even if theyre popular/trusted ones.
    <br/>
    :|
    <br/>
    <br/>
    im still very curious what happend to those packages.. some of the missing was ordered along with other packages all in the same period, none of those came..gone with no track, soon 5 months ago and still havent heard from customs or anything either and other drugs still coming thru so... :S
    <br/>
    also 2 of my missing packages were only 5 tabs of lsd (small pieces of paper supposedly stealthily packaged) that should even have a very low chanse of being stopped!
    <br/>
    other times I got all my orders..
    <br/>
    dno whats up.. in my case it seems weird if it was vendor mishaps as 2 packages I ordered (from different popular vendors) a short period was both lost,never showed up. Also kinda doubt it was customs tho, or I think I should have heard something by now..
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Ok thanks for asnswering.... it seems like you have been quite happy to order to same address after missing packages. This is kind of what I want to hear, I'll probably try another small domestic order then.
