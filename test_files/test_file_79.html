    Ive been reading that its recommended to write return to sender on the package when receiving it to remain safe and leave it for 24hours on the doorstep. Thing is, what if post man just comes the next day, just doing his job and takes the mail and sends it back with no suspicion raised?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I live in a block of flats and leaving the mail there might lead it to some neighbours touching it and misplacing it or even putting it outside, where anyone can take it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Is there certain things to do when writing RTS on the mail? Such as putting it inside the letter box for instance? Im sure most of us wouldnt want to give away our orders that easily especially since nothing went wrong.

    you dont have to do that, just maybe if something suspicious happens and you want some extra security
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and you dont leave it on the doorstep to be picked up... you write RTS and leave it alone INSIDE the residence

    I'm not sure about the law specifics, but the idea is that anyone can send you anything in the mail without your consent or knowledge, by writing return to sender you are providing evidence that you have no idea who sent the package or why so your plan was to return it to the sender, thinking it was a simple mistake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are officially rejecting the package by writing "return to sender" on it, if LE were doing a controlled delivery (sting operation) they would watch you take the package inside, give you some time to open it and take out the contraband, and then arrest you. If you write return to sender and leave the package unopened you can say you didn't order anything and the package was not yours and that you planned on bringing it to the post office and having it sent back. Again I'm not sure how it would hold up in court but it certainly looks better than having the police come in while your snorting a line of powder next to an opened package that they knew contained drugs!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reason you wait a day is because if it is a controlled delivery, they wont wait longer than a day to storm in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep in mind this is VERY unlikely to happen for personal amounts of drugs, if they were to intercept your package and find a gram of speed they would confiscate it, send you a letter, and put you on a watch list but that would probably be the end of it. Its not it to LE to make a big deal about 1 gram.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you do get a letter, realize that they will be checking all your mail for now on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are ordering larger quantities, like to sell, its a different story and the "return to sender" method wont do a thing. Its hard to believe that someone would accidentally send a pound of cocaine to you or send it as a prank, if it was a gram of coke you could say someone wanted to get a random American arrested so they sent drugs to your address, but no one would send thousands of dollars worth of drugs to a random person as a prank or by accident!

    J, my signature is not actually a joke... it is however not a real offer (i dont have a vendor acct and cant make offers).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the whole point is just to reinforce my initial statement that people should actually do some research on whatever they are buying here first.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you wouldnt believe how frequently i actually get people honestly requesting a sample even after i asked them if they have done research on my sample. then they think its funny for some reason when i tell them it would have either given the parkinsons like symptoms or killed them

    I've heard from people who have gotten multiple love letters and they keep on ordering and it does not seem to make any difference. I would not get too paranoid if you get one. In the future they may get their act together more but right now thats the way it seems to be.
