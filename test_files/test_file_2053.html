    This is probably be a dumb question, but I  haven't seen this talked about anywhere. Does the USPS monitor for people buying postage online through TOR (not stamps but the actual postage labels with the tracking # and everything)? I want to be able to get tracking or DCN on my domestic shipments but would rather not have to go to the actual post office to do so. And afaik, there is no way to anonymously get tracking or DCN with stamps.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Otherwise, it would seem that as long as I put a fake return address and pay with an anonymous Visa gift card all would be fine.

    First of all your question is not a dumb one but rather an important one.  Using electronically generated postage/shipping labels  is very risky and should be avoided.  There are two ways to create printable USPS shipping labels. One is Click n ship at usps.com.  You pay postage with a debit/credit card which of course, leaves a paper trail.  Unless you have debit card in a name/address other than your own you are playing with fire. The other way t create shipping labels is using their click n chip for business which is an application you download and store on your computer.  You can print out labels without postage...so no debit/credit card required.  You use stamps you buy at the PO.  Bottom line is electronically generated labels produce bar codes..no way around that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My advice is to print out shipping/return addresses that you have \typed out in a Word file or Notepad..and print them out, cut to size and place on the package.  Even if you print without postage the application has to connect to usps.com servers to calculate postage price. Tor will not protect you when you access external apps.  DCN stickers... the PO gives away free and buy stamps to cover postage.  The ONLY way to ship anonymously is place the  DCN on yourself along with postage stamps.  Tear off the customer receipt part of the dcn sticker and drop the pkg in a blue box.  Don't take your pkgs to the counter for processing.  If you do and the pkg was to get intercepted along the way...it would take Postal Police about 5 minutes to put your face with that package.  This is why the 13 ounce rule came about after 9/11.   It limits ways mail pieces can enter he system that aren't traceable back to the sender. By the way the 13 ounce rule is abut bombs..not drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also..don't use fake return addresses. This is a big red flag.  Return addresses are analyzed for accuracy very early on in processing.  Try to find a multiple resident address close to where you will drop..like for instance an apt. building..or high rise.  Use any name other than your own, and the real address but leave off the unit or apt. number.

    Awesome, thanks! That's exactly what I was looking for. I didn't know we could get and apply the DCN stickers ourselves. So for flat rate Priority Mail envelopes would it still be $5.15 with the DCN sticker or would this be extra?

    Delivery Confirmation on stamped mail is an extra charge of 75 cents i think it is now so $5.15 + $.75.  You can use any combination of denomination postage stamps  m to make up the required total but most PO's sell  the $5.15 Priority stamp.
    <br/>
    You can ship practically any class of mail using the blue drop box including  Express mail.
