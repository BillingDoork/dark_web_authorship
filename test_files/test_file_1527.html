     Fedex and USPS notes left on door/in mailbox respectively - failed to deliver

    I know half of these threads are buyers waiting for their orders to show up and they get paranoid because it takes 12 hours more than they expected and everyone all of a sudden assumes they're getting CDed.  So, in advance, sorry if this is a little like a broken record.  But, I haven't missed packages before/they've always been in my mailbox/never had anything with FedEx before (prior to this always ordered domestic) and I would love some feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. (The sketchier of the two)
    <br/>
    Bought a very large quantity of drugs from outside of the US, to the US.  It's less sketchy than heroin.  It's more sketchy than viagra.  I guess I'm trying to say if they've opened it and know what it actually is, especially with the quantity, I would definitely expect a CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Vendor sent me tracking.  Got here very fast (on par with buyer feedback).  FedEx says they tried to deliver yesterday morning and this morning.  I just got the note left on my door.  It says "Leave this signed from on door.  Shipper requests signature (ISR)" and the box for my signature is circled.  However, "be present for delivery" is NOT checked.  My intuition says this means it is not a CD.  Like if I signed that they could leave it on my stoop, they just would and they wouldn't know I was home or whatever if I didn't answer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I want to get it today because I feel bad leaving the funds in escrow and frankly I'm itching for the product.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a.) Does this sound like a CD?
    <br/>
    b.) Regardless of whether it is one or not: is it ever safe to physically go to the fedex office and just pick it up?  I would think even if ordinarily they don't need a signature, they might if I go to pick it up.  I definitely would need to show my ID.  But surely someone has ordered something, missed the 3 attempted deliveries, and had no choice but to go pick it up?  Is this alright?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2.)
    <br/>
    This one is probably a stupid question but since it's related I'm going to ask it anyways.  I have always had USPS packages left in my mailbox (they never have required a signature).  I have a note in my mailbox that says a USPS attempted delivery and failed.  I can come pick it up or sign the little form that says they're authorized to leave it on my porch or whatever.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, it says you can't choose that option if the box on the front is checked mandating the recipient be present at time of delivery.  And that box is not checked.  So, I think if I checked the box saying yeah go ahead and leave it I wouldn't need to sign.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question then is, if I don't need to sign for it, why don't they leave it to start with? The only thing I can figure is if it didn't fit in my mailbox.  But, my mailbox is one next to like 20 others, and there are package doors where ordinarily they put it in there and then put the key to that in your box.  And if it is what I think it is, (a pretty non-CDable, low-key product, despite technically being illegal), it would fit in one of those.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not worried about a CD with this one but am mostly just curious if what I've experienced is typical, for both USPS and FedEx.  I've purchased many items on SR by now but never had this happen, so just wanted to check.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks for reading and feedback!

    Oh! An important additional point.  On the tracking of the FedEx sketchy package, it says "Indirect Signature Required".  It is FedEx International Priority.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How often does FedEx make you sign? Are there vendors that just choose the default shipping options and require a signature?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    God, I feel like every other poster in the Shipping forum just being paranoid and it's all over nothing.  If I were reading this I would tell myself to cut the pussy shit and just go pick it up.  But alas, it's the SR Jitters and I don't really want to be arrested. I like where I am in my life.  And I might be deep in the blues at the moment.

    Despite 67 reads I have no feedback.  So I'm going to pick up the FedEx delivery (sketchy/package #1) now.  Will update when I'm back.

    <br/>
    If I don't post by 10:30 EST (-4) then I've been arrested. Not to be dramatic or anything.  Wish me luck!  :-X

    Just like I said earlier, I was probably being an idiot.  Was a little worried because I had to sign since I was picking it up there.  But once I saw the stealth on these ... I don't know why I ever worried at all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another perfect example of irrational worrying by the SR buyer.

    I'll update once I deal with package number 2 tomorrow morning.

    In my experience I have always had to sign for fedex. Ups and usps leave packages, but yes that note you have for usps is just tell us to redeliver and we will.

    We have mailboxes and sometimes they do that if it wont fit, or jeez IDK they just want to be annoying..I had my mailman bitch me out for not getting my mail out of the mailbox often enough a while ago(long ago), my mailman just likes to be a dick.

    Thanks buddy for the confidence boost.  :-*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Final update.  I went to USPS and picked up the package.  The place was only a few blocks from my house/apartment/shack/dorm/rehab center/pad/loft that I live in (trying to be anonymous, yo).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They asked for ID, then just gave it to me.  It was an illegal substance, actually the same substance as package 1, just about 10% of the quantity so less suspicious.  Also, it was domestic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I did have to sign something.  I assume this is only because I picked it up.  Stealth was sufficient that I shouldn't have been too worried.  Nothing like the complexity and sheer awesomeness of the international package but suitable and typical for domestic products, similar to all the others I've had in the past.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wanted to update in case anyone has a future experience like mine!  Also, it just sort of hit me how bizarre it is that this has been read 275+ times.  Can you imagine having a couple hundred drug users/dealers/connoseuirs show up to your place of residence, listen to you give them all IRL advice?  I'm almost flattered. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck to everyone and I wish you a CD-less season!
