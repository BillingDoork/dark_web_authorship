    So I was reading another thread about how a long time vendors stealth was sub par. I have had this problem a few times with long time vendors, I hate when I open package and feel like I got lucky. I like opening them and being like fuck ya no problems here and feeling confident. I want people to be tougher on feedback for everyone's safety. So if you have gotten a pack from a vendor and said fuck ya I'm not even worried about that getting stopped throw his name on the list.

    Nice idea for tread  but this need be divided for categories of the product
    <br/>
    its not same if some vendor send pills  or  KG's  of weed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just my 2 cents

    I don't think it needs to be divided up it would be a good place for people to skim through and see what vendors are taking their customers safety seriously. Perhaps just add what the vendor sells next to it or what your ordered.

    Good idea for a thread.

    Reich's stealth is absolutely brilliant in my opinion. Really goes the extra mile on it, I never have to worry when ordering from him. (K, MDMA, MXE not sure what else he sells or has sold).

    A list of vendors with excellent sealing materials? Awesome. A list of vendors with the best (ie: probably disguised, not simply nondescript) stealth? No fucking way. It takes ONE order from ONE cop to discover the packaging of any vendor on the site. Again, not a big deal if it's simply plain wrapping, but something distinctive but deceptive? Why paint a target on the best dealers like that?

    I completely agree with oldtoby. Feel free to list vendors with excellent sealing materials, but do not discuss the vendors with the best stealth - it puts vendors and their shipping methods at risk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is a free forum and you may discuss any topic you see fit to discuss, but if it describes shipping methods in any way that can threaten the security of vendor's packages it will be locked and the offending posts will be edited.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which vendors have the best stealth is a purely subjective matter, but I would strongly advise against posting such opinions in order to protect the security of the vendors in question.

    Anyways I think it should be wiser to make a list of irresponsible vendors rather than stealthy ones, since basic "stealth" should apply to everyone. At least for the most popular "smelly" products like weed, coke, lsd and mdma, IMHO a basic checklist could be like this:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Type of shipping
    <br/>
    [ ] domestic [ ] international
    <br/>
    [ ] standard envelope
    <br/>
    [ ] suspicious/nonstandard envelope
    <br/>
    <br/>
    smell protection layers:
    <br/>
    [ ] none
    <br/>
    [ ] vac seal
    <br/>
    [ ] mylar
    <br/>
    [ ] MBB
    <br/>
    <br/>
    visual protection
    <br/>
    [ ] this is drug and I'm attaching the invoice too
    <br/>
    [ ] none
    <br/>
    [ ] normal
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course this should only apply to bad vendors, since good vendors should have at least standard envelope, vac/mylar protection (depending on type of product) and normal visual protection (again, relative).

    Ahh...I see.  LE will look at vendors on an amazing stealth list and then target those vendors; making  things t too easy for them.  My blonde must have been surfacing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways,
    <br/>
    on a 1-10 scale(10 being bad) how bad is a hand-written label, written in pencil on an international package(box)?  And if it's an "in c/o" name, how bad is it if the vendor messes up and writes "John Doe in c/o John Doe"?  Seems that would be 2 flags, but I am still studying how these things work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I didn't see an option for boxes listed in the survey; skipping those for meow?

    Semi-related question, how can vendors properly stealth large amounts of canniboids? I know you can't give out specifics, so use your better judgement but I just don't see how you can move that much weed stealthily. I want to order a quarter of hash but if it rocks up in a vacuum sealed bag inside a brown envelope I wouldn't be real impressed, seems like that would be one second under the x-ray and they'd know what it was, smell proof or no and I'm really not interested in getting my address tagged over some weed.

    I dunno, I guess I'd have to just risk it w/ an order to get my head around how the stealth works for something that isn't powder. No more than a QP ever though, that's for sure. I'm no dealer. Just seems like if you can't stop someone from moving a QP of bulky, smelly weed through the mail then why do they even bother.

    You can MOST DEFINITELY get MANY, MANY QP's through the mail. And yes... all at once even. Have been on the sending and receiving end of quite a few large packages in the last 4-5 years, 98-99% of the time everything is fine. I wouldn't really worry about it, if it has worked for other buyers and the vendor seems responsible I'd imagine you could get pretty much whatever you want shipped. Letting yourself receive a larger pack is a different story however, and that much only you know. Best of luck with however it works out. BTW best stealth I have seen came from JoR. Truly pretty impressive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note to all: If you haven't already, order something from one of the vendors known for truly good stealth. Doing so not only rewards the vendor for setting the bar in terms of shipping safety, but also makes you a more responsible buyer. Obviously don't share with people other's methods but knowledge is power in more ways than one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Best of luck to all.

    I completely agree.  However, I see nothing wrong with stating those vendors who you have used that have always had excellent stealth and packaging methods.  Along with those that you have used and have no confidence in.

    Well you can complement some vendors for their stealth i think it's cool and important . but shouldn't reveal the packaging methods they use.
    <br/>
    Like the custom can't really tell from which vendor the  delivery came it's not a problem to complement a vendor for hes stealth.. but if you say exactly how it been packed the feds will know where to look  ;D

     Semi-related question, how can vendors properly stealth large amounts of canniboids? I know you can't give out specifics, so use your better judgement but I just don't see how you can move that much weed stealthily. I want to order a quarter of hash but if it rocks up in a vacuum sealed bag inside a brown envelope I wouldn't be real impressed, seems like that would be one second under the x-ray and they'd know what it was, smell proof or no and I'm really not interested in getting my address tagged over some weed.

    Probably won't be a popular opinion but you shouldn't be ordering large amounts of weed in ways that will require it to be potentially x-rayed. Weed is a pain in the ass for transporting large amounts in nearly every way, its bulky, it smells (easy to fix but the others aren't) and customers don't like it being compressed. It's also hard to disguise &amp; easy to visually identify.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The best advice with weed is if you need large amounts, grow it yourself or buy it domestically so it never gets near an x-ray. That said there probably are a few ways you could send large amounts on a regular basis but they would all require a lot of setting up which takes capital and really if you've got money to spare doing that you might as well just set up a commercial grow op instead or just getting local contacts.

    "worst stealth" vendors would mean the ones remaining in the pot would be ranging from just above average-pretty decent-ok-"laughable"-pretty good-fucking amazing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whereas if one goes straight to the best, well when a race is over you normally want to know who came 1-3, not who came in the last 3 places

    I believe it would have much better impact if the customers call out the vendors that need improvement for the safety of the customer rather than painting targets on the backs of the vendors with the best tactics . . .  this is an open forum, &amp; more info that gets thrown around won't necessarily positively reward the vendors that have been looking out for the safety of the masses.

    if that is the main logic behind it then by all means name and shame and reach out to the vendors who need improvement.

    the one time I ordered a gram of mdma from juergen (god what a mistake) the stealth was just god awful, but for the small amount it did not really matter

    dutchaanbod had some pretty damn good stealth for what I have seen, probably the best I have got overseas.
