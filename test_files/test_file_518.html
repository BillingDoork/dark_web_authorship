    Hello all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So here's my situation:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the address i plan to use the past residents still get mail sent there regularly.  Three different names still have mail sent to this address, and mail shows up for them just as often as for the current residents.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm thinking that the best plan would be to use these old residents names for small personal-sized shipments (letter size), and use the proper residents name for anything that could be larger (in case a larger package cannot be delivered and needs to be picked up at the post office where proof of residence may need to be provided). The latter would probably only happen on larger amounts since the residence has a typical mail slot for delivery.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I correct in my assumptions? I should i not bother and stick with the current residents name on all packages? Considering plausible deniability and all, wouldn't it make sense to take the opportunity and use the old residents names?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hope you guys can help me out :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers!

    It's a little dangerous because the previous residents could start getting their mail forwarded at any time. The previous tenant at one place that I lived started doing that 6 months after I moved in. However, it's still safer than getting it sent in your name, like you said, because of plausible deniability.

    I've been at this address for more then 6 months. One particular name continues to get mail almost daily, in fact i think they purposely haven't updated their address (this person gets cc bills and student loan docs all the time lol). Is it a safe bet to use that name, knowing that they get mail delivered here as often as my own? I realize that I run the risk of this person suddenly rerouting all their mail to a new address a i could potentially lose a shipment, but that seems unlikely considering the volume of mail i get under that name currently.

    Yeah, you have a point.  I suppose the possibility of them suddenly forwarding their address outweighs the convenience of having a burner name to send to.  And no harm meant by the grammar comment pinus, just havin' a laugh :)

    You should just use your real name to make sure the mail comes.  However you could create a burner name over time by sending yourself random mail in that name to the address.  After a month or two of mail coming in that name it wouldn't seem out of the ordinary for packages to come in that name and it would help because the name would be associated with the address. I wouldn't advise using a fake name unless you did this process first.  But also keep in mind if you were to do this and didn't get the packages you wouldn't be able to blame the vendors either.

    It seems to be unofficial policy for postal workers to place a forwarding sticker on the mail box when an address is officially changed but that would be the only warning you'd get if any (and they should not be doing this at all as I understand it (maybe someone could confirm)).  I would not want to risk this OP.  Lets just say your donor name did get something forwarded to them and opened it and reported it... it may be only a matter of time before they will scrutinize every piece if mail coming anywhere in your general direction.

    Yea.. Good argument.. Its a hard one, but for my situation its: Would I rather have 10 grams of MDMA shipped to my house under my name, or shipped to a PO box not under my name? I'm already taking huge risks by getting MDMA through the mail from Germany or the NL. So the added risk of the fake ID to open a PO box doesn't really phase me much more.

     You should just use your real name to make sure the mail comes.  However you could create a burner name over time by sending yourself random mail in that name to the address.  After a month or two of mail coming in that name it wouldn't seem out of the ordinary for packages to come in that name and it would help because the name would be associated with the address. I wouldn't advise using a fake name unless you did this process first.  But also keep in mind if you were to do this and didn't get the packages you wouldn't be able to blame the vendors either.

    That is a rather brilliant plan  8)  I may just try that.
    <br/>
    Agreed; The risk of no vendor blame exists with a burner but i generally wouldn't have a large enough shipment sent for it to bother me too much if it was lost.

    Once it is through customs the mail dept just delivers letters to whatever address is on the packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The postal services don't give a fucking shit who they're addressed to and customs don't cross reference every letter with it's intended address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One must realise they deliver millions and millions of letters per day and any mail monitoring system would completely choke up the supply line fucking business correspondence along with personal letters.
    <br/>

    If you use your real name to your real address you are asking to go to jail... just sayin

    <br/>
    Use the local Realty directory... find a house that is empty and use an innocent sounding name, monitor it's delivery by working out delivery times from it's destination by ordering legitimate items from said country beforehand.

    So who picks it up there? What does that person say when retrieving it there and it isn't his property or name and it's under surveillance? What I have received so far Internationally is anything but on time and I don't want to be hanging around an empty house. I understand it might be better option but it still seems rather too risky as well for large amounts or international imports. I'm fine with small amounts with my current set up but if I move in what I mentioned before I need a better plan. Hopefully someone can show me a safer way.

    Found this too and I don't want his Birthday present

    I've been asking myself the same question... use a previous resident's name?  I'm in the U.S.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get a lot of mail for several previous residents... for one in particular- some important stuff, like pay stubs from the military, court orders, etc.  I asked our landlord about the tennant and he told me that the tennant lived there several years ago.  Mail forwarding in the U.S. only lasts for 6 months, so unless this old tennant decides to randomly have his mail forwarded from this address, and its quite possible that he has move several times in the last few years, the mail will not be forwarded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I first moved into my place I asked the mail woman to politely remove the previous tennants mail and stop delivering it.  She told me there was no way for me to stop the mail for the previous tennants being delivered, and that I should talk to the people at the post office.  My partner went to the local post office who told us there was no way they could stop the mail from being delievered either, and that we should discard it or save it and bring it to the post office for them to deal with.  We have since been assigned a new post woman who keeps delivering anything with our address on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This being said, I am thinking of using the previous tennants name because:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. I feel it is less incriminating for a package to be delivered to your home with someone elses name on it, especially since the post office told us there is no way for us to stop the mail from being delivered
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. If someone comes to my door and asks for me to sign for a package addressed to someone else, I can simply decline and tell them the person no longer lives here
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. My partner is not aware that these packages will be arriving, so if for some reason something goes wrong and we are asked to sign for a package during a controlled delivery, my partner will decline to sign for a package with someone elses name on it
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm questioning this logic because:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. If the post woman starts seeing packages being delivered and asks who actually lives there, I'll have to tell her that the old tennant does not live here and I may lose some packages that may be in transit
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. If for some reason the mail woman sees that the old tennant does not live here anymore and decides to "return to sender" the package, the PO will find out the return address may not exist, and then may open the packages and find contraband- which would lead them to my place
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3. Carrying or opening someone elses mail seems suspicious, and in the unlikely even of a search will be incriminating itself
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts on this?  It's something I have been contemplating for some time

    I made a post earlier about sending mail routinely to your address using a fake name so it wouldn't be abnormal for mail to come in that name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After further thought though I would recomend against fake names for the simple fact that if a package is left at the post office by the mail man you won't be able to pick it up without id in most cases.  This would cause you to lose the package. So all in all not a good idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just use a real name and if package is ever intercepted or you pick it up you always have the ability to deny that you knew what  it was.  I mean the average person doesn't always know when they are getting a package and if they got a slip to pick up something from the post office they would go get it. it doesn't prove you were aware of the contents.

    I don't think I would ever go to the post office to pick up a package I knew contained contraband... In my experience it would be better to lose a package than to get busted.  I'm pretty sure that LE is going to arrest you whether or not you know the contents of the package, especially if your name is on it.  The charges may not stick, but you're in jail for a few nights and end up spending several thousands on a lawyer

    Thats a valid point. I guess it would depend on what you are ordering. If its an order large enough that it prob wouldn't fit in the mailbox then I would consider picking it up. But if it was something small then I would be suspicious.
