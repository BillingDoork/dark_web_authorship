    Sorry to be a smart ass but this question has actually been answered a million times, if you are delivering it to your own address use a real name so it doesn't raise suspicion with the postie, and so that you can maintain plausible deniability.

    Yeah... Pffft... Searching...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fancy schlepping yourself, when all it takes is to ask a question in the forum! Fuck all the members who've been around a little bit and get sick of answering the same inane questions from idiot little kids. Besides, if you wasted time searching yourself you might encounter the unfortunate... EXTRA INFORMATION you didn't realise you wanted to know... FUCK THAT!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NO ONE MAKES US LEARN STUFF WE DON'T WANNA KNOW!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ANSWER MY GODDAMNMOTHERFUCKING QUESTION OR I'M GOING TO CHUCK A TANTY AND HAVE A BIG SULK SESSION ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HURT MY FEELINGS WHEN I JUST WANTED AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION THAT GETS ASKED 7 TIMES AN HOUR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    STOP BEING MEAN TO ME. IT'S NOT FAIR. WHY ARE YOU TORCHING ME?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yep, fuck search!

     I dont have anything against using your real name, its probably the easiest way to go. But is a postie really smart enough to remember every name for every house?

    Considering my particular letter box has mail delivered to 5or 6 different recipients regularly , i dont think so, if rain man was our postie on the other hand/ or was a rogue vigilante out to fight crime, we might be in trouble...

    Dude, asking questions that have been asked an uncountable amount of times isn't really putting yourself out there as a sharp shooter, more like a blunt stick. Worthy contributions are always appreciated, questions that no one has asked before are the same.
