    hey guys, just joined up and loaded up on bitcoins. I'm just a bit sketch about making my first order. can you guys give some tips for a buyer? searching thru the forums seems to suggest using real details, as fake ones may attract more attention. any dos &amp; donts etc would be a great help. for example, if  o/s vendors are worth trying to get thru customs
    <br/>

    cheers

    hi mate
    <br/>
    <br/>
    to answer some of your questions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - i use my real address. i adjust my name so that it's close enough that the postie will recognise the error - but far enough away so that i'm not indictable. an example off the top of my head - if your name was Sam Adams, you might put your real address with the name Adam Samuels. (not a great example, but you get the idea). obviously don't get it delivered to your parents house.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - yes, i think there's just too much risk using a completely fake name. posties are pretty dumb, i'd hate to ever lose a package because it was a name the postman didn't recognise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - i've had 2 orders shipped from overseas (Canada) that i'm confident weren't a scam (there was one other, but i think i was scammed) - only one got through. whether or not it's worth getting through customs depends on what you're buying. if you're buying an ounce or less of pot, just buy domestic. it'll be more expensive, but your package won't go through customs, and you'll have it in about 3 days. but there are other things that might be worth the risk. for example, if i wanted to buy 20 eccies, i'd be taking the risk and ordering them from europe for half the price.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - hopefully you know your drugs - i'd hate to think that SR was being used by first time drug users wanting to experiment. (I'm confident this doesn't happen though, it's too much of a pain in the arse setting it all up). there are drugs that obviously aren't worth even trying to ship. obviously this is all subject to the stealth of the vendor, but heroin will usually be detected. eccies are sometimes going to be detected. but from what i've heard, ketamine won't be detected. it has to do with smells that dogs will pick up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - for do's and don'ts - do be patient. do research on the forums and on peoples feedback. do ask if you have questions. do start off with small orders, preferably domestic ones, to understand the process more. don't be annoying. don't go slagging people if you don't have your mail in a week. don't try and order 500 pills from Europe as a first order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    may i ask how you acquired bitcoins on a weekend?

    hey nob signup so I can pm you, want to compare notes

    OP - absorb all the info you can, including these forums (a lot of these Q's already have A's) and start small and easy with new orders

    i like to throw a random initial, like "Q" in my name so i know what it is as soon as i see it in my mailbox. i've heard people say stuff about how they almost threw out mail because it looked so inconspicuous and such. that'd blow.

    Apply the 'be patient and do research' to the top paragraph, too.

    I'm a newbie of sorts.  I'm experimenting with shit I didn't even know existed, let alone do I know anyone else who even does drugs over and above the odd joint at parties.  I'm the veritable chimp in the spaceship.....albeit with the advice on these forums and a good dose of erowid  ;D  You can't go wrong unless you're an idiot or have issues that drugs probably aren't going to help.  ???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My general advice, is try to only order powder from OS, from guys who don't have a paranoid distrust of people from Australia  ;)  Molly supply is a bit sketchy at the moment, but Ivory is king when he's back from holidays or whatever he calls it. Molly analogues, no problem with most vendors, but ask around first.  Supplies of RC's from a handful of good vendors so no problems there.

    The more you know, the more chances you have of being successful.
    <br/>
    Spend some time reading up on every small source of information you can, research your vendor, and when you are ready to make an order be sure you are completely confident you know what you are doing and what is going on.

    knowledge is power, my first time here i was lurking the forums for about a week before i jumped into doing anything. 1. is safety precations, and if you have that down and locked then 2. is finding out how to get bitcoins, there is a bunch of ways and 3. build up your rep as a buyer, it's going to be hard as you have no transactions and some vendors might even scam you but do your research on your vendor by checking their rep on the forums, even trying to spot out the fake feedback with real feedback on their vendor page and start out with small orders first to prevent getting scammed.

    Cheers guys, some useful tips there that should help a ton, but fortunately also some things I was kinda thinking anyway; research vendors on forums, build up some transactions, being smart with the shipping. Also reassuring that its a pretty legit, secure market (despite what recent police press conferences might be suggesting, ha).

    - I ordered the bitcoins in a few days back, but the waller software took days to get up to date

    <br/>
    -Yeah I've had enough experience with drugs, just can't find the stuff where I am at present. Thats great to hear that K might not be as detectable, will look that up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd love to know what countries of origin tend to attract the least attention in customs, but I guess that can be fairly subjective

    Guys I ordered some xanax but it never arrived.
    <br/>
    I live in an apartment and for the past 2 years have still been getting other people who have lived here's mail occasionally (3-4 times a month) so I used one of these names, but alas still did not arrive.
    <br/>
    Should I just use my real name but make a slight variation (the vendor has offered to reship).
