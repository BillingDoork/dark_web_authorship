    Ordered some powdered shrooms in a bubble envelope last week and received it today with a customs seal, meaning it has been opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Already wrote "return to sender" on it just in case the police show up. But most likely, they won't show up and they are probably keeping tabs. What do you guys think ? Or maybe, they didn't know what it was since it was powdered and didn't smell like anything special. But in this case, as a custom officer, I would have sent the thing to be tested in labs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, what i want to stress here is that this powder could have been way better concealed in a business envelope, and that this seller is not taking enough safety measures to ensure the customer's security.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I will discuss this issue with him before finalizing and giving feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously sellers, the package arriving is sometimes not good enough.

    It depends what the notice/letter said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They're not keeping tabs by letting you get some powdered shrooms.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They would immediately destroy and issue notice or not, but unless it's controlled delivery I doubt they're going to let them through,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs work with, but are not police.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless you're buying a lot of things constantly in large amounts they don't have resources to keep track of you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs opened it likely detecting plant material - as it posed no danger to the local eco system they let it through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They do this most of the time and this has happened to a friend - same deal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chill out, enjoy... and for god sake don't think about it while you're having the shrooms!!!! :)

    They probably figured it was some kind of supplement, since a lot of them would look the same as shrooms ground into pills and it would require tooÂ  much work for them to determine what was actually IN the capsules

    i'd just change mail locations in case they flagged you
    <br/>
    <br/>
    but there's no way they would only flag you and let you have the shrooms
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so now either they're about to bust your door down, or your safe. the latter is prob 99% true
