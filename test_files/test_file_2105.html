    Hi all,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As an Australian; we don't have the luxurious range of weed that some of you other countries do. I'm considering ordering various strains from various countries and was wondering if anyone could advise on how well shipping will be to Australia (considering how potent some weed smells).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kind regards,

    I would imagine that as long as the vendor seals the package really well, it shouldn't be too hard.. then again, alot of vendors only ship to Aus offering no refund due to our customs being so good at finding shit....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are willing to take the risk to buy in bulk from O/S, you could have a decent market domestically.

    Aus weed is meant to be among the best in the world, especially down in South Australia! But it is true that we don't seem to have as much of a range of strains here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once vac sealed, shipping is pretty much the same to Aus as anywhere else. I've never had a problem getting weed in from OS, and most of the sellers I have used haven't asked for early finalize. The amount you buy probably will effect how easily it will get in, largest I have ordered is an ounce and that looked very discrete in a bubble wrap envelope.

    I think the thing about weed is that if customs scanned it will show up as organic matter whereas pills or powders do not (Not positive on this)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Customs crack down a lot harder and put more resources into stopping plant materials or organic matter from entering the country because we live on an island and a new pest or disease could seriously fuck up our ecosystem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why not just buy here though, weed is the one thing we have in abundance and there's plenty of good stuff to be found from my opinion.

    I agree.

    We do actually have some good smoke down under, it's just that we (as in the buyers and sellers) don't usually pay too much attention to actual strain names as such.. well, at least in my experience anyways..

    Weed is the main thing that you should order domestically.... Low risk domestic, and no big deal if you get rumbled due to an inept vendor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Canamo's AK is brilliant for example.  Also,  internationally you are usually paying $400 an OZ, which is the same or similar price that the vendors in Aus
    <br/>
    are selling Amsterdam quality weed for.  It's not like MDMA or other gear that is 5 times more expensive locally.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is plenty of good weed to buy IRL in Australia, but unless you are buying from friends the bags are usually underweight/poorly manicured/ half wet
    <br/>
    or all of the above...

    Depending on your state you might be lucky and have it as a non criminalized substance. In which case importing would be dumb as sh*t! Im sure international sellers got it down pat to avoid the smell but getting done for illegal importation of a substance in abundance here... same strength and less risk to buy domestic seems stupid haha but where theres a will there's a way haha

     this isn't true at all. Australia has some of the best weed in the world. There was a news paper article out (like 5 years ago, so no i dont have a link) that tested the THC content and showed ours was one of hte strongest buds in the world behind the Netherlands.

    I only buy weed locally from SR and even then, it's only a small amount to sample other dealers wares... Which I will add has only been top notch!
    <br/>
    IMO, if you've been on the smoke for 5 yrs plus and don't have a reliable pot contact IRL... you're not a reliable person!!! That being said, some folks don't have access due to location, situation or just being Novocaine, but I'm sure these guys still know where to go and get it when they can!

    I've tried swazibudbud's weed. Remember, you get what you pay for. :) It is indeed very cheap, and as described just grown by farmers in rural areas so its not terribly strong, but it does have a very earthy natural flavour to it. I'd say its good value, and its a personal choice of whether you want a stack of lower quality weed cheap or a small amount of high quality expensive. Last I checked a half ounce was only a few coins cheaper than some of the main Aus sellers, and for that extra cost you get much more likely delivery and postage in less than a week rather than 2-3 weeks from South Africa.

    Best weed I think I've had on here so far was Budzillas sage n sour, had his Strain x also that wasn't too bad. Aussiedrugmans Jack herer was pretty good but expected more by the way people were reviewing it. Tried the white widow x ak47 that sells sometimes was sorta ok, but made me pretty tired. Excited to be trying Canamo's AK47 soon and Aussiedrugmans Trainwreck
