    Just stick it in a envelope buy itself and right marijuana on the customs label. The best stealth is no stealth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously though you think anyone is going to reveal something like this on an open forum. Purchase the listings yourself and find out.

    What the heck are you guys talking about.. basic knowledge here.
    <br/>
    2-3x vacuum seal
    <br/>
    1x moisture mylar bag
    <br/>
    hide it inside an item that should be able to avoid xray showing weed and require tearing through (research on your part)
    <br/>
    you can also PLASTIC WRAP IT with the machine, it will look professional and they wouldn't mess with it.
    <br/>
    as long as you chemical clean everything, and make sure you clean in-between stages so no weed particles are on anything
    <br/>
    ebay labels (help with obscurity)
    <br/>
    and all other labels printed
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What else do you need to know? Package supplies? Shipping labels? You understand the shipping methods, it's either slow 4-8 days no sig, or fast xpresspost 2-4 days sig required. Most people don't want to sign. I've read you can avoid the signature requirement for xpresspost but have no other information on it since no one on here answered my question.
