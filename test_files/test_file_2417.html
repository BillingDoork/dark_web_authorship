    I made an order and I forgot to give a name , I just gave the address.
    <br/>
    The Vendor has since sent this package not noticing that the name was missing from the address.
    <br/>
    Is this my fault for not putting it or the vendors for not noticing ?
    <br/>
    What is likely to happen ? Will they overlook this at the postal services and send it anyway or will there be problems ?

    There's a 50/50 chance of receiving the package. There are lots of letters with no names on them (spam), at least in the UK. I don't know what to say if you're receiving the package from a different country.

    I presume you'll get the package, but asking is it your fault or the vendor's fault is ridiculous. It's entirely YOUR fault. If you can't give a vendor your name and address correctly then perhaps you're not cut out for ordering drugs through the mail.  ???

    How do you forget your name?  That is like trying to drive a car without starting it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm assuming you didn't want to risk putting your name on it, if that is true, it looks more suspicious now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try messaging your vendor and see if he/she really sent it out already.

    Just to update it did not come, vendor was nice enough to send a resend of under half. And address was disposed of.
    <br/>
    I have to wonder if the vendor did actually send it or noticed I didn't put a name so he could say he sent it and say it was my fault for not turning up.
    <br/>
    Wont be forgetting a name again anyway.
    <br/>
    And I have spent a large amount on this site putting my name there ! I just forgot the name on the address that one time :(

    Truth is, you were at fault of leaving your name off, but the vendor was a total dumbass /dumbfuck for sending it in the first place!  You should have gotten all your money back for his stupidity!  No intelligent vendor would send out a package without a name!  He really shouldn't be allowed to vend with moves like that!  We won't send an order if the name is missing, or part of the name is missing.  We message the buyer &amp; let them know if they want the transaction to continue, that we need a full name to accompany the order.  Simple as that, end of discussion.  WOW Unbelievable!

    I couldn't see why the postal service wouldn't deliver that. If they see an address it's their job to deliver it. If there's no name, can't say for sure, but can't see that causing problems at all. I'm usps has seen no name before.

    I think its stuff like this that raises the eyebrows of postmen. If he see it, he'll look very closely at the package, grab it, try get a smell from it, etc. I think this is half the problem with packages not making their destination. The postman know what to look for i'm sure.
    <br/>
    Fingers crossed for you it arrives safely...but it might end up in a dead letter room...if it had tracking you will be ok i'd say...
