    From Drug Interdiction: Partnership, Legal Principles, &amp; Investigative Methodologies, 2e, G Steffan,  2012.

    available at your local library or at your favorite bookseller.
    <br/>
    cited under fair use/for discussion.
    <br/>
    Unfortunately, this board will be withering at some point soon.
    <br/>
    Therefore, with thanks to the person who provided the book, I'm going to edit much of the remaining segment out.
    <br/>
    Anyone else who wants it should be easily able to find it using a search engine.
    <br/>
    NB: Recent events suggest that somehow, sometimes, they don't need to get a warrant to open a package with a false name at a real address if the non-sender who lives at the listed return address gives permission to open it.

     Random Examinations of Parcels
     <br/>
     When the canine team advises the investigator that the dog has alerted for the odor of narcotics in a suspected parcel, an investigation commences. An outgoing parcel investigation should be conducted to verify sender information such as name, address, and telephone number. Probable cause necessary to obtain a search warrant for the parcel is developed in this way. It may be necessary for investigators to verify the location by driving by the address.  A sender address may not exist or may be part of a large apartment complex with no apartment number. The sender name must be verified and typically is a common name or does not exist as it relates to a particular address and telephone number.
     <br/>
     ...
     <br/>
     The receiver law enforcement agency should conduct an investigation on the name and address. Typically, the name of the receiver is fictitious or is a variation of the true name of the receiver. The address is generally correct, because the sender wants the package to be delivered. However, the location may be a “drop” location or a residence where the receiver may be waiting for the parcel to be delivered.
     <br/>
     ...
     <br/>
     If law enforcement agencies determine that the information on the sender side is fictitious, coupled with the canine alert on the parcel, probable cause would exist to obtain a search warrant. The local jurisdiction the parcel is located in would prepare a search warrant and have a magistrate or judge sign it for purposes of opening the suspected parcel.
     <br/>
     ...
     <br/>
     Management or loss prevention personnel of the facility should be asked to make a computer entry in their system so that if the drug trafficker checks the parcel by tracking number, it is not reflected that the parcel was taken into police custody. This should be discussed, and the tracking may reflect that there was some sort of sorting problem and that the parcel is at a particular location. This is extremely important with overnight parcels, as time is critical in the delivery of the parcel, which makes it very difficult to conduct a controlled delivery in a timely fashion.

    Moral of the story:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use an MBB, process that MBB through the dishwasher to remove external debris on the exterior of the bag. Wrap MBB however it is meant to be prepared (clean materials ONLY) and package it in envelope or box for shipping. Seal the package in a garbage bag (stored in box in CLEAN drug free environment) and it's ready to go. If the dog doesn't alert to the package (which it won't if you've packaged it properly) there is no reason for them to look into it more. Also, making sure the return address "checks out" is important. Try Whitepages.com reverse address look up for this.
