    Two weeks is not normally a worrisome amount of time to wait for an international delivery, but I feel like I have reason to do so. Two orders which should have been virtually identical were shipped over two days back to back. The first order came quickly with good stealth and no issues. A week later I'm still waiting on package #2 and starting to sweat. I've already cleaned out my place as best as I can, and won't be ordering to this address again until I know for sure the issue is resolved. Most of the info I've found says the same thing: clean house, remove all traces of SR from the computer, admit nothing, etc. Basic stuff I feel I've taken care of.
    <br/>
    My question, for those of you who've had cause to worry over this sort of thing is how long did the situation take to resolve? what do you do differently? am I unnecessarily agitated over what still might be a regular mail delay? Thanks.

    Bro, I actually just had a situation almost identical to yours, i waited nine days before it finally arrived. I've waited damn near a month before for packages from overseas.

    In my experience there is not pattern or educated guessing when it comes to international shipments. They just come when they come. If two items that look weigh and feel identical are sent out t the same address at the same exact time, it wont make a difference on if they wil come at the same time. Some take longer than others its just how it is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once i package is on a sorting belt there is no control over what gets sorted in what order, it just happens. And as mind racking and annoying as that is its the truth. Not to say dont be careful and safe. I good amount of paranoia is always healthy in my book. But the simple fact is that if your tryign to decode a tracking number's information to see if its a controlled delivery it just wont happen. Just always remember never sign when you didnt expect to sign, keep a clean house, deny and play dumb, and keep a really good lawyer on speed dial if your worried.

    Are both packages from the same seller?

    Do you have tracking numbers or could you have been ripped off?

    Hey #slothrop, rest easy dude. Im sure its typical post errors. Nothing to fret over im sure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I once received a pack from Indonesia, that after 5 weeks i was certain was history. Then one day, all weathered and beat down, my goods are in the mail box.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On occasion, shit will happen. The long as it isnt a large order, and by large i mean distribution large, i wouldnt worry too much. Im sure it will pan out just fine.

    Ordering International is already risky so im confused as to why alot of people only become frightened once they think a OS pack takes long. You already essentially embraced the risk/ stress when placing the order overseas. Theres so many factors with customs so playing it safe and sitting tight is your best bet.

    I'm constantly popping in and out to check when I'm home, but at this point I'm pretty much resigned to wait it out. I got a half refund on what was already an incredibly cheap product, so financially I'm untroubled by the delay.

    Question: It's been over a month since tha parcel was supposedly shipped; how long until I'm in the clear w/r/t customs. So far no letter. I was thinking another month from now I'd feel safe to order again, definitely not any sooner. Thoughts?

    Two months with no word is likely adequate, As long as your orders aren't commercial or anything I don't think anything tooo awful will happen. I still hope it works out for you though.

    I remember my first O/S order never made it. After a month, i ordered again to the same address to see if that address was burnt. The order arrived which was a surprise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After a month you should be fine, just make sure your vendor is using Mylar bags. I have a feeling customs are using more drug dog shifts, etc and Mylar bags are our only guarantee..
