    Please help me make sense of this. I received a piece of mail NOT related to SR that had been opened and put into a plastic sleeve. Said mail was a product with the same form factor as folded card stock in sealed MBB (would feel just like it through an envelope). I have multiple SR orders seemingly "lost" in the mail, but no love letter, for weeks. Has my address been compromised? Is my mail being set aside to be felt up, inspected and apologized for? Has this happened to anyone before and what's going to happen next? Here's the message printed on the plastic sleeve...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Dear Postal Customer:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We sincerely regret the damage to your mail during handling by the Postal Service. We hope this incident did not inconvenience you. We realize that your mail is important to you and that you have every right to expect it to be delivered in good condition.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although every effort is made to prevent damage to the mail, occasionally this will occur because of the great volume handled and the rapid processing methods which must be employed to assure the most expeditious distribution possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We hope you understand. We assure you that we are constantly striving to improve our processing methods in order that even a rare occurrence may be eliminated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please accept our apologies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sincerely,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your Postmaster
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My thoughts are that packages my address is being monitored

    discgolfking sounds knowledgeable. I've had a few broken, mishandled packages, but have never received a letter like that. That's why I said it sounds sketchy...maybe they just do it for envelopes?

    The package got ripped during transit. They re-packaged it for you and apologised.  You've got nothing whatsoever to worry about.  It happens now and again.  Chill :)

    so what were the origin of these other SR orders that are 'lost'?
    <br/>
    have you contacted the vendors yet?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    just curious, because a notice like that would make me fucking paranoid and while you should mostly stay calm it is understandable to freak out a bit.  I have never had anything go 'lost' in the mail, knock on wood.

    This is normal when mail is damaged by postal machinery.

    Don't worry about it.

    I've seen this several times. When mail is mishandled, they have to put it in bag and give you an apology.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This would however, be an easy way for people to search your mail without a warrant. I'm not aware of how frequently this loophole technique is actually abused.
