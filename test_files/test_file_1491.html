    Hey everyone,
    <br/>
    I've ordered some mdma(5g) from one of the top sellers. It went in transit on the 26th of June.
    <br/>
    We had a chat before about if its going to make it within 10 days in time for my bday but of course i wasn't counting on it. his response was that "there's no reason it wouldn't" since it was leaving the next day (which turned out to actually leave 3 days after..) - again, no problem with this since i didn't ask for anything officially and he didn't promise anything officially.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thing is - that it is now a month after and still no sign of the package. we already extended the AF 2 times, and now heading towards the third one (due in 2 days.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thing is that on his review page on the forums - 2 people were talking about the same thing, package didn't arrive yet - and they both ordered at the same date that i did (somewhere between 21-26th of June).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not sure what am I supposed to do here - the vendor's reply is to just keep extending and they will accept. for how long should I do it and wait? Should I? Anyone ever got their package after more than a month?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This vendor has %100 positive feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance!

    get a refund mate, a month is too long to come from anywhere. if it does turn up you can always do the decent thing and let the vendor know, 9 times out of 10 they'll not bother asking for the money back because it took so long to get there

    I guess that's the reasonable thing to do. I'll write it down on the next resolution center message.
    <br/>
    (although Two of his newest reviews on the page say "Took longer to arrive than expected" and "shipping took longer than expected".)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now the only thing im left worrying is "Did the item get seized and my address marked?" - I'm saying this since because of the thing with the other two forum members who said they ordered at the same date and didn't get it as well.(as stated on my first post)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    so confused. thanks for the reply.
