    To introduce myself, I am a newcomer to the SR. I have familiarized myself with all the procedures and methods to safety with using the SR. I am not a big drug user, I've smoked maybe 2 grams of weed my whole life. I simply want to purchase about 10-20grams of marijuana for my own personal consumption. It helps with my issues. I have the strongest urge to purchase from SR, but I feel like all odds are against me and I will ruin my life. I think I will eventually muster up the courage and buy some weed from SR.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But, before I do that... maybe some of you could assure me or give me some confidence?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd like to know how often LEOs find a package and how often are people caught using the SR. I read a lot about safety precautions if an LEO were to interfere. Having an LEO come to your door seems common by reading the forums, or it may just be an exaggerated sense of paranoia from users discussing the possibility of it.

    Thanks

    welcome to the forums, but there's probably hundreds of threads either asking this or addressing what you're asking right now so please search in the future.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In regards to what you're asking, you probably shouldn't start off with ordering 10 or 20 grams once off. Make smaller orders of 2-4? Depending on what you're comfortable with, also drug laws really depend on where you live as they differ accordingly e.g. some countries .1g and you get the death penalty whereas some countries decriminilise up to 7g. Also do tons of research on vendors and the general consensus is ordering domestic will almost guarantee that you'll get your package since it doesn't have to go through customs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you've done all your research and take the necessary precautions, the chances you will end up being busted and ruining your life will be extremely low (bear in mind there is still a slight chance of things going wrong, you are after all ordering drugs in your mail).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally, if you do find yourself facing a LEO, the most important thing is to not tell them anything at all, and just ask for a lawyer. Once again, if you've followed all the steps necessary, and didn't do anything stupid like ordering a kilo of weed, chances are it'll be extremely hard for them to prove anything that will seriously be against your favor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All the best.

    10-20 grams is fairly small time compared to a lot of the transactions that go on here, LE places most of their focus on the big time suppliers, dealers, etc. Going after you specifically would be somewhat of a waste of resources (but I guess the war on drugs in general is a waste of resources, right? ;) )
    <br/>
    Spend some time on the forums, check sellers out, read up on the quality of their stealth. Do your homework, and you'll be perfectly fine.
    <br/>
    Happy travels! and welcome to the Silk Road; we are happy to have you.
