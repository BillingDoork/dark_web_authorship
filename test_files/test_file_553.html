    Should actually be well within a week, but remember that a vendor marking something dispatched doesn't always mean it has entered the postal system at all.

    I used to buy hash from a vendor in France. The shipping time varies, I don't know if that's because of the vendor or because of the postal service. Anyways, as the other guys said, it should be within a week or so. I got packages in 3 days as well as 7 so to set up a standard shipping time is almost impossibleas there are many factors that can delay your package.
