    I've been thinking of bringing some powdered shrooms back to my home country (I know the common wisdom is to mail, but still), and it occurred to me a good way to do it might be to mix them into some other edible powder.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's say onion soup powder or chili powder. Then when I wanted to trip, I could just mix a suitable amount of the powder into some cold food, and it would be easier and perhaps even less suspicious than the chocolate method.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any other suggestions for the least detectable way to hide the powder that won't cause it to degrade? I've never actually seen the stuff in person so I don't know the type of grain or color it is.

    Until you actually see these powdered shrooms, there's no way to plan hardcore. But at least you're thinking about it.
    <br/>
    As long as the country that you're traveling into does allow other countries' food products, you should be ok with something like that chili powder.
    <br/>
    HOWEVER, be wary because it IS a powder and any agents that do analyze the items you're bringing with you, will be suspicious of all powders-whether they are clearly marked or not.
    <br/>
    Just for example or whatever, I took a flight across USA last year (for a funeral) and as it was my first time flying in about 20 years, I was nervous. I took a valium, threw one or two into a travel size tylenol bottle. Put that and my other toiletries into a zip locked baggie, right on top of everything in my suitcase. Once xray was cleared and i was cleared i knew that it was all good..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically be calm, and conceal your contriband well, and you would be all good man,
    <br/>
    Stay safe, be smart. Youre good.

    Thanks.

    How about liquids, like pasta sauce to be even safer? If I blended it into that and transferred it into a mason jar and refrigerated it at home would the actives keep?

    I would think liquid would be worse....not sure if it would stay intact or if the shrooms would actually separate from the sauce.
    <br/>
    I would definitely keep to something normal, inconspicuous, and try to make it look like you've never opened it or tampered with it in any way.
    <br/>
    May I ask what countries you'll be traveling to/from/through? Just in general. Like Australia is huge on not letting certain things in.

    I'm traveling to a country that is pretty hardcore about certain substances but I've always brought food back no problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course making it look like I haven't opened it is another issue I hadn't figured out yet... I assume they have trained eyes for if you've glued the freshness seal back on so it'd be better to just make it look like I already ate some.

    Gotcha.
    <br/>
    I think the answer is going to be really simple when you figure it out. You'll have to figure out how much powder you're dealing with here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do x-rays actually see through, say, an eye drop bottle or travel shampoo bottle, or does the x-ray just see the bottle? Assuming you can mix it with water. I really wouldn't know if it would tear apart some chemical properties, but I wouldn't assume it would.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, as a side note, how hard would it be to press it into paper? Like not mix paper and drugs, but literally have a few sheets of paper that are solid shrooms (or really any drug).

    Well, a couple of oz, so it shouldn't be that large I don't think. But the 20 trips will last me a year, maybe more if I combine them with acid sometimes, so it's a worthwhile endeavor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It would be nice to just put it in some suitably colored powdered drink, but just the thought of said powder being tested in some back room at the airport makes me nervous just sitting here thinking about it. If I don't feel 100% sure I'll probably turn fucking green at the customs desk.

    Shroom paper, haha. Might be on to something there.

    What's stopping you from using the post? It's far less scrutinized than any luggage and will not be in your possession/control until you receive it.

    You're guilty until proven innocent where I live. Denying the package does nothing. And mushroom powder is organic, so even hidden it would show up on a simple xray right? I'd take 30 minutes of panic that I was about to lose a decade of my freedom over days or weeks just sitting at home waiting for it

     Buy a pack of twinnings tea bags, cut open a tea bag or two depending on how much powder you have, empty out, and put the powder inside.
     <br/>
     Seal the bag again with glue. Put it back in the paper satchet and seal that with glue as well.
     <br/>
     Put the bag back in the box with the other paper tea bags and you are good to go.
     <br/>
     You can put a little dot with a ballpoint pen so you know which one has the powder.

    I had considered that, except all the ones I could see use staples rather than glue, and it's still technically a powder, sealed or not.
