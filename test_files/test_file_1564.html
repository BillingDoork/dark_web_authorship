    Search function doesn't appear to be working at the moment, so...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Has anyone shipped any type of drugs to someone living at a military base?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does their mail go through extra scrutiny or screening?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would anyone advise for or against this, and why?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!

    Outgoing mail from a US war zone will get censored to make sure that the soldiers are not putting anything confidential in them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would guess that incoming mail to a war zone is probably opened and checked before it gets to a base to make sure its not something bad.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not sure how a home on a base works or how mail is received into barracks. Just as an instinct though it seems like a pretty bad idea. At least for the person receiving.

    That's kind of what I assumed for a base in a warzone. This particular shipment would be domestic and shipped to an individual in boot camp/training. This person claims to get a lot of mail from friends and family, and doesn't believe any of it to be "opened" or checked. My only fear is that Uncle Sam being Uncle Sam, I feel like mail into government areas/facilities would be checked no matter what. However, at the same time, for them to go through every single military member's mail, would be quite costly and inefficient, to say the least.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyone else have any input?

    NO. No way, no how, no Sir.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes they get a lot of mail, but the chances are higher of detection then regular mail, simply because there are many more hands touching military mail then normal mail. And the cost of getting caught, just not worth it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am not talking out of my ass, I am just saying I would never. Never, and I do not tend to be paranoid. Maybe they need to set up a po box off base, and then, but NOT to any military installation. Hell no.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NO.

    Well sometime they use to open up some letters than have been sent FROM the base for sure.
    <br/>
    But weren't any problem with incoming mail ever. What you should do is ship whatever you want along side with some food &amp; snacks which is the must common thing soldiers receive ! security changes between basses I'm pretty sure but there aint no dogs or anything like it , It should pass with no problem :))

    Not to be argumentative, but some bases have working dogs, most do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They train the dogs all day all over the base with them. Depends on the size of the base and all that. And how big their working dog program is,  if its housed on that base.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have lived near 2 bases with training dog programs, and if you don't know someone working on the base you wouldn't have a clue about the number of dogs there are and all the training they do all day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Law on a military base and regards to its mail is completely different, seriously this is the worst idea I have ever heard.

    Nah dude ive served in couple of military bases and one of them was highly secured.
    <br/>
    There weren't any dogs as i recall at least not any where near the incoming mail (Remember it's not a custom and dogs are used for different purposes)! I remember they took all incoming mail and throw them at large room and than someone had to volunteer to go pick them up and distribute them, We had no mail guy or someone handling them it was us picking it . i never recall ANY package being opened and searched NEVER EVER EVER! If i attempted ordering drugs into my base i truly believe that they would pass with no problem.  this is at least from my experience.

    Sounds like a terrible idea, but if you must... I'd 3x vacuum seal your goods and stash them in a perfectly re-sealed container of food of some kind, e.g. peanut butter or something else messy to pick through.

    <br/>
    I'd also not send anything remotely smelly.

    If they have a big enough suspicion or think someone is selling they will 100% bring in dogs. Trust me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once that mail enters the military base, however, it is subject to a completely new set of laws and rules. They don't need a warrant, they'll open anything on the slightest suspicion something is in there. I'm sure you probably could get it through, but I wouldn't recommend it. Plus if it gets found your friend is going to get fucked..... figuratively.

    Thanks for the input guys. I already put the order in.
    <br/>

    It is not active duty/warzone overseas, and the substances in question aren't really ones that dogs are typically trained for. Also it is for personal use, no plans to distribute or anything like that.

    They don't open soldiers mail, except in boot camp if it's a package.  It's usually a care package that the DI's eat right in front of you while they make you do pushups in the mud.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They don't read outgoing/incoming mail either... it's not prison.  What they will do is execute you for treason if you write letters home talking about operations and shit.  (after due process, but in real, active war time, I mean... accidents do happen)   In WWII, there was a man executed for deserting.  No trial, they just executed via firing squad.  The point being, rules in the military are not that of a civilian.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is true that mail in the military is subject to military law, as in, warrant-less searches.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    IMO - I think you'd be nuts to have drugs sent to your APO-FPO address.  But hey man, best of luck!
