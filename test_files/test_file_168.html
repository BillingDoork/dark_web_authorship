    I'm just getting started on SR and am trying to figure out the best way to receive packages from the vendors I buy from.  I could use some advice!  (I'm living in the US.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From reading over the forums and the SL buyers guide, I hear that I should use a different address than where I live, perhaps a PO box, or perhaps even use a different name, but then others say not to do that.  I'm not sure what to do.  It seems like using a fake name is a bad idea.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't see how a PO box is any better, since I would create it, and it would soon after receive an illicit package.  There's no plausible deniability there.  I suppose it helps in that the sender doesn't get to know my real name or address, but I'm more worried about LE discovering what's in the package and coming after me, especially since I plan to buy from a vendor that's reputable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't really have any friends that I would want to send the package to, either because they won't be willing to receive it or it just puts the risk on them, and I don't want to do that to them.  Is there a way for them to be more or less risk free?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So it looks like the best idea is to use my real name and address, but that just seems too sketchy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What other options do I have?  Or should I just go ahead and use my real name and address and hope for the best?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (Thanks in advance! :D )

    Most of the advice I have seen is that if you cannot ship to any address but your own, do some creative spelling on your name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Change 'walker' to 'waller'  that kind of thing.  Use a different initial.  As long as the address is correct it should get delivered without any problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then if anything happens and you get a love letter, just ignore it.  If they push, it isn't yours, you have no idea where it came from.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never sign for anything.  Never admit anything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is highly unlikely that they are going to push you for what is basically small amounts, unless you do something stupid like admit it's yours or sign for something when you know it the shipment wasn't supposed to be signed for (even then you can still plead ignorance, you have no idea what it was, the postman asked you to sign, so you signed.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.O. boxes would be great, but unless you can sign up for one without ID, it is not worth the hassle.  And using fake ID for the box opens you up to mail fraud.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, go ahead and order something, try not to worry too much.  Usually the worst that will happen is it will never arrive or you will get a letter from customs saying it was held up (just ignore the letter).  If you are ordering US to US, there is even less reason to worry as it won't be going through customs. As long as your seller packaged it properly, there is nothing to smell or see that would make them want to check the package.

    Your post is a very good summary of all of the often conflicting information and advice that is dispensed here on the forums.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As someone who has been on both sides, seller and buyer, I'd advise you go with the "modified name" strategy as follows:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You don't use a friend's address because that just puts the onus on them if there's a problem...that's no way to treat a real friend.
    <br/>
    You don't rent a P.O. box because that shows intent before the fact and that's something that's impossible to deny convincingly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your best bet is to use your real name but change it slightly: if your name is John Frick, tell the seller to use J. Frack.
    <br/>
    This gives you plausible deniability in that you can say "it's someone with a similar name, but it's not me".
    <br/>
    Your insurance against any issues resulting from using your real name and address is to be sure to buy from a known, reputable seller, then your info has virtually no chance of falling into LE's hands or being left around for someone to discover.
    <br/>
    But really the biggest insurance you have is that LE is trying to stop SR and the largest sellers.  There is no way that LE is going to go after all the 50,000 people on SR that buy personal use amounts.  It's just not feasible in terms of budgets or man hours. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck with your purchases.

    If you are using a trusted vendor then there shouldn't be any issues with using a name that is almost spelled correctly. The post office may  not deliver the item if the name that is used doesn't belong there. In fact, I will not send to a name that is obviously fake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or phubaiblues method of finding houses/apartments that were not  being rented at the time and using those. Thats just asking for the package to be returned and when its returned its not going back to the vendor, its going to an unsuspecting business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always use and address and a name that you are 100 percent confident that it will arrive safely. If you are unsure, then send yourself a test letter. if it arrives safely then most likely you are ok..  Many vendors will use delivery confirmation. This is not tracking but a way to prove that the item was delivered. You wont have to sign for it..Basically its paying 60 cents for peace of mind...(But, you cannot use DCN on a letter, it needs to be a bubble wrap package)

    I think I'm gonna go with the altered name, but correct address method.

    <br/>
    Got one question about a possible tactic-- I live in an apartment building and I'm pretty sure I've seen things delivered to us with no apt #.  They just drop everything off at the front, no door service at all.  So, altered name (but similar to mine), no apt#, just the building address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    any input on that idea would be greatly appreciated.

    PGP, encryption, and buying Bitcoins are all a lot to figure out, but you've got to get an understanding of how they work before you jump in to your first buy.  If you just rush in to your first buy you may later realize, when you learn more about the process of buying things on SR, that you left some tell-tale tracks.  Better to take it slow now than do something foolish (like transferring Bitcoins from an account in your real name directly to SR) and have to worry that LE may come knocking on your door.

    How about you not risk the vendors' safety and just make the mail BLEND IN with your NORMAL MAIL, by having it addressed to the same full real name and address that you receive all your other mail addressed to?

    I'm leaning toward this option. I'm planning to place my first order as soon as SR is back up and steady. I guess the counter argument is that a fake name gives you plausible deniability, i.e. "It's not my package 'cause that's not my name on it."

    I'm doing the same thing as the last 2 posters. At first I had my seller use my full first name then last initial. That package was seized, so I decided to change it to my full name for the reship hoping to have it not stick out. I'm also wondering if customs matches up the name to each address and red flags any names that are out of the norm

    I see the term "plausible deniability" alot around here. The fact is that mail blending in is better than the whole "that isn't mine" defense. controlled deliveries tend to happen shortly after the package is known to be in your possession, so don't open your package for a while (I'd say wait a day or two). then, regardless of who's name is on the package, you can deny knowing what was in there. I might go so far as to say that if you opened a package that was not in your name, and were caught with it, you might also be able to add mail fraud to your list of charges. BUT if you still feel that a fake or obscured name is what you really want to do, before ordering to that name, first, hit the web and sign up for some random catalogs, news letters, inquire about bankruptcy, etc with that name. you will start to recieve TONS of mail with that fake name, then that name will not stand out against the rest of the BS you are getting. but again, if you open the package before they arrive to search you, you are still just as screwed, but if you use your real name, you are committing one less crime than you are by using a fake name.
    <br/>
    I guess what I am trying to say is, think about the packages you are receiving not as illegal drugs and contraband, but more as junk mail, or packages that aren't that important to you. don't open them right away, or even in your home for that matter. You are probably getting mail in your real name anyway, and you probably don't open it all as soon as you get it, so stop worrying so much about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I picture most of you guys shaking all the way to the mailbox, with your head darting from side to side looking for cops the whole way from the mailbox. I don't think sweat rolling off your head and studdering ttthhatt iiiiisn't minnnnee is going to be that believable in the first place.

    First post. Woot. :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From what I've read on the boards, I've come to the opinion that in regards to receiving the shipment keeping it simple is best. No crazy made up name, no abandoned house, etc. Blend in and don't arouse suspicion. I myself would probably have just used my own name. That being said, I've been getting mail from the previous tenant for over a year now. Not a ton, but a letter here or there, usually ads and business stuff. This seems like the perfect alibi to me, at least with flat mail/nothing that would need to be signed for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I received a letter (undated, even!) for the previous tenant about a week before I placed my first order.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Worst case scenario, I would simply inform the popo of the truth. I've been getting mail for this guy for a while now. Here, you can have his last letter that was just delivered. :) I definitely don't plan on opening anything I get for at least a day or two.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Might I be missing any loopholes? I realize none of this really applies for packages, or sellers requesting delivery confirmation, but w/ a regular ol' piece of flat mail...

    My concern would be, what if the USPS had a sudden attack of efficiency and forwards your package to the new address of the named recipient? Or what if he/she forgot to submit a change of address card and did so months or years later?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not trying to shoot you down. Brainstorming like this helps me too as I have yet to make my first purchase on SR.

    I'll chime in with my own (limited) experiences receiving shipments:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For my very first order, I used the name of the previous resident (now deceased).  It was shipped from overseas to the US, and I never received it.  I assume it was either intercepted somewhere along the way, or got forwarded to this person's living relatives.  In the latter case, I sure hope they enjoyed it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For my next two orders, I used a slight misspelling of my real last name.  This time I stayed within the US.  Both shipments were received a few days after ordering.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know many vendors advise buyers not to use "fake" names, but using a variation of my name is the only way I feel safe ordering illegal drugs by mail.   Perhaps that's irrational thinking; I don't know.

    I've used the name and address of a prior tenant before, and it did get delivered.  Then one package I ordered from the states, Express, turned out it needed signing (neither I nor the vendor realized this until we check after the fact).  I stood at the door, looking around, and it was my regular postal guy, so I just mumbled it was a previous tenant who sometimes picked up his mail, signed for it, then went back in the house and sat down until my heart stopped thumping.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I get stuff all the time with the correct address but the wrong name.  Up here in Canada I don't think they even bother to look at the name to much, it's the address and postal code they really check.  But that being said, if you do use a previous tenant, you want to make damn sure they don't have an active re-direct on their mail.  Those things last 6 months, so don't go using a previous name if they only moved out a couple of months ago or someone else is going to be enjoying your package.

    This may have been covered elsewhere in the forums, but has anyone ever tried having a package (a small, envelope sized one presumably) sent to their address using the name "Resident"? It blends in with the regular mail, it has neither a fake name nor a real one on it, yet is likely to be delivered to any home address... it seems to fit advice on all sides. SR packages disguised as junk mail?

    The previous tenants at my place were all hippies and we still get their mail all the time. Sometimes thick packages too lol. As long as I provide the address with one of their names, I should be all good.

     This may have been covered elsewhere in the forums, but has anyone ever tried having a package (a small, envelope sized one presumably) sent to their address using the name "Resident"? It blends in with the regular mail, it has neither a fake name nor a real one on it, yet is likely to be delivered to any home address... it seems to fit advice on all sides. SR packages disguised as junk mail?

    You have to be absolutely positive it looks like a free sample of some kind that could go to anyone if you're just going to use "resident".

    Another newb here, also trying to learn everything I can for the sake of all involved before I place my first order.
    <br/>
    Are PO boxes generally frowned upon? I have one and have a fake name I've had packages sent to in the past, multiple times. Nothing illegal, just stuff I didn't want recorded under my name. I told the people at the po box place the name was a friend of mine, and everything has always arrived unmolested, so they know the name and won't find it suspicious. It seems to me this is therefore a good system to use, anyone see any potential issues that I'm missing?

     I'm just getting started on SR and am trying to figure out the best way to receive packages from the vendors I buy from.  I could use some advice!  (I'm living in the US.)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     From reading over the forums and the SL buyers guide, I hear that I should use a different address than where I live, perhaps a PO box, or perhaps even use a different name, but then others say not to do that.  I'm not sure what to do.  It seems like using a fake name is a bad idea.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I don't see how a PO box is any better, since I would create it, and it would soon after receive an illicit package.  There's no plausible deniability there.  I suppose it helps in that the sender doesn't get to know my real name or address, but I'm more worried about LE discovering what's in the package and coming after me, especially since I plan to buy from a vendor that's reputable.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I don't really have any friends that I would want to send the package to, either because they won't be willing to receive it or it just puts the risk on them, and I don't want to do that to them.  Is there a way for them to be more or less risk free?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So it looks like the best idea is to use my real name and address, but that just seems too sketchy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What other options do I have?  Or should I just go ahead and use my real name and address and hope for the best?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (Thanks in advance! :D )

    My advise would be that u find some small side road what end in to forest or something. then see the last number of the house on that road. so if the last house is numbered 15 u go to buy mail box with number 16 and stick it in to the side of the road and make the order tho that mail box. then just go to near by in the wood to wait untill the mail man comes to or maybe if the customs or cops will come :D
