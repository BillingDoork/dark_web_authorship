    Just got 4 x Pink Stars from DopeyDwarf, but don't think i will be ordering bigger amounts from NL.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm right now tossing up between two german vendors, sesampino and FORMAT13, and leaning towards the latter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wondering if anyone has had success?
    <br/>
    Not looking for '23 days and still waiting' just looking for people who have actually had some get through.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Would be really appreciated,

    Plenty of German success stories floating around, although why people don't just order crystals and go make their own caps using gel caps you can simply buy from Chemist Warehouse is beyond me.Â  Pills just seem extraneous and obvious...not to mention very 1999 :)

    Because I sell, and the preferred product is pills, for some people just like colorful little things with logos (capitalism is responsible no doubt).
    <br/>
    Also, weighing out the right dose for many, many pills is time consuming.

    If you order 4 pills to sell, you should probably stop selling.

    :| four pills for personal use. although where i am currently working in northern regional western australia an unknown ingredient tripstacy pill sells for for about $65AUD meaning a quality mdma pill would go for around $80. 4 pills at $80 = $320 which isn't bad profit off of $15 wholesale at a 96% profit margin.
    <br/>
    maybe you should stop being an elitist criminal.

    thanks man! i just found After Hour yesterday, and think i will try 25 off him, and if that works sweet i will go to 50.
    <br/>
    i will probably order before your's comes through anyway, but thanks for offering to keep me posted.
    <br/>
    i reeaallly love the press of those golden mtv's from FORMAT13 though, probably the nicest pill i've ever seen.
