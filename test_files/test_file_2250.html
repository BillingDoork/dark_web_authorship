    I'm gonna be in the US for a few days (may be around a week), and I'll be staying in a hotel.
    <br/>
    Of course, I'm not gonna bring my gear with me, but I 'd like to have some fun.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, ordering to a hotel. I see two obstacles:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1- timing. I want the shit to be delivered on day D or D+1. Because I'm only staying there a few days, and also I don't want to keep
    <br/>
    asking the reception for mail.
    <br/>
    2- Putting my real name on the envelope. That kinda risky, but what are the options? Telling the receptionist that there's a letter for a "friend" may not work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any thoughts? Any vendor able to satisfy the timing constraint? Anybody done that before?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What I'd be ordering would be coke and/or MDMA  and/or K.
    <br/>
    Acid I might actually bring myself:)

    A buddy of mine does this.  He Fedex's it to the hotel with tracking on it.  So, I would suggest you purchase the drugs beforehand then package them yourself and send them to the hotel.  This way you won't have to rely on the vendor's shipping skills.  I wouldn't really suggest Fedex since they don't need a warrant to search a package.  Also, with tracking my friend just waited in the lobby for the package to arrive.  Good luck.

    well, doing it myself I'd be breaking more laws, and I'd be in much greater trouble if the package is intercepted - it'd be from my permanent location, so much easier to pin to me. Also, it'd be an international mail, whereas if I could by off of a domestic (US) vendor here.

    I am sure that there are vendors that offer a variety of shipping methods ie overnight  that the shipping charges would b high if I was going to do this..........I would contact the vendor prior to enure he could ship when I required it. Business ship all the time to hotels.I would contact the hotel about shipping address to ensure no errors in addressing package. There is definitely more risk involved but no more than trying to score in a strange city IMO
