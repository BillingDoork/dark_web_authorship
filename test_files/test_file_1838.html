    I have read foreclosed homes do not work. But what about homes for sale, when there's no one living in them? The people who used to live there have passed. I thought I could send it to their last name, with a different first name. As if it was their kids. Thanks. Good idea? Bad idea?

    Realistically, it could work. Mailmen are pretty good about doing what they're supposed to do, some take their job a little too far though and will go to the extra length if they feel like 'doing the right thing' or something's up. If possible, take down the sign the week it delivers or find ones that are in nice neighborhoods where they are common to leave packages in a trusted neighborhood.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All in all, you DO risk your entire investment. Be aware of that, but that's the price for not having to deal with risking your friends/yourself. Let it go if you feel something is up. I'd fear a sting. Make sure you track the mailmans route and be ready for it if you see anything suspicious.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I wouldn't blame any vendor for warning you that you risk it, with no chance for a refund.
