    Today my buddy woke up to four feds knocking on his door trying to deliver a package.  He didn't answer and evantually left out the back of his house.  This is my second friend to have packages intercepted through usps express and have some sort of fed try to deliver it (both time 3 cops).  I'm not sure what it is with express shipping but somehow marijuana is safer sent by USPS priority.  Any one have similar troubles?

    Four at once? That doesn't sound very smart on their part. Do you have anymore information about the situation? Sounds like they just straight up wanted to arrest him. A CD, from what I've heard, is one fed dressed as a postal worker trying to get you to sign or take the package inside, while the other ones lay in the bushes.

    every CD is different, obviously they don't want people to pick up on their methods.
    <br/>
    usually they get a postal inspector to deliver, OR a fed dressed up(only in FedEx and UPS cases does the latter happen.)
    <br/>
    they can only bust you IF you sign for it.
    <br/>
    and four FEDS.. does sound fishy.

    did it happen to deal with Lucymcgee? i was reading her feed back earlier and two 1/5's "cops involved" and "busted".

    The first situation was roughly a year ago.  In both situations they let the first package go through and the second one was brought up by multiple people usually well dressed.  I've always heard that CDs were with someone pertending to be mailmen but both these times they came with either 3 or four people.  So I think they were going for the tactic of scaring the receiver into admitting it was theirs.  Neither were Sr orders both were from medical states shipped over night with no signature required.  I'm really just saying that I think Express is less safe but I'm not really sure how that is.

    Sounds scary. Just NEVER EVER open a door for them, let them kick it down if they want in that bad, and they will, if they have a warrant, they won't bother knocking on the door. Anyway, just a word of advice. Seriously though, I don't understand why express is less safe than priority either.

    lucy had a thread about that incident earlier in the week, both fb were left by the same buyer, and from what she said it sounded, to me, like a set up. Basically buyer ordered to a college address, freaked out and asked her to call the PO and have the packages sent back. The whole thing was very suspicious and sounded more like a cop trying to trick a seller more than anything.

    Yeah, no offense to the OP ... but the number of narrowly missed CD's and their circumstances are a scare tactic IMO.

    So whats the likelyhood that the alleged CD wasn't from SR this time?

    I find it hilarious how many of these stories are friends/buddies/friends of friends and never contain any details at all.

    I was just trying to give people heads up I've seen it on here before and I shared two stories that affected me.  If you don't believe thats fine I was just trying to help the forums out.  But with a controlled delivery they can't detain you if you don't accept the package so the story is plausible.  I think all the situations involving the feds are different so theres no way someone on here could say thats untrue unless the person seems like a complete idiot.

    It can be considered less safe because of the fact there are less express packages/letters then there are priority. The ratio of inspectors to packages then goes up because of that and express mailings might get scrutinized more. My 2 cents.

    FIRST OFF..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Express requires NO WARRANT to open it, period.
    <br/>
    Priority does require A WARRANT to open it, period.. and with the bankruptcy that USPS has been facing for over a decade now,
    <br/>
    they've been plagued with the reality that it is TOO HARD to get a postal inspector to every state to inspect every package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i won't do Express anymore. it's just not worth it. most Express packages come in two days anyways..

    i think there may be some miscommunication and/or misinformation on your friends plight.  If this is in the US and it was for maryjane they weren't the feds for starters.  One of the most wide spread lies about getting drugs mail order is that by using the mail if you get caught you're going to federal prison for the rest of your life!!!! (i know that's a huge exaggeration but you know what i mean) This is not true!!! in order for the feds to pick up a maryjane case (using the mail or not) The weight has to be dramatic.  The feds won't take a marijuana case under ten lbs or something like that i have no clue what the actual number is but unless your buddy was receiving ponds and pounds what probably happened is somehow usps or the local cops found out what was in the package and the local PD sent three detectives  (in most city's,towns etc.. local detectives wear plain clothes and those little badge necklace thingy's. )
    <br/>
    Their plan was probably to try and scare your friend into taking ownership of the package because if he does they'll put a good word into the judge and make sure the feds don't get involved  ::)  either way it's not good, but not nearly as bad as people are probably thinking.  To add to express shipping fuck express.  most people want 50+ bucks to ship express and even then it isn't any faster.  I live on the east coast and if i'm getting something from the west coast this is how it breaks down
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. standard first class = 2-3 days
    <br/>
    2.priority 3-4 days
    <br/>
    3.  express 2-3 days

    If that's true, I think SR should ditch express mail. This coupled with more inspectors is scary as hell. On top of that it costs $20.

    well,
    <br/>
    I know one thing like about 50miles from where i live, but still hit my small time paper. any how a girl had 3 or 4 pounds shipped from nevada. Anyhow she did not have to sign but the girl leaves a not "in shower just leave any mail or packs on the porch..." anyhow it ended up the watched her for 6 hours until she loaded up the box in her van and went to pull out.  mean 6 hours they waited house surrounded and all! I am just saying the postal inpectors found it was hit by a drug dog and they got the local pigs involoved no feds not even for 4 pounds of "high grade marijuanna" as the paper read/
    <br/>
    Well she told on her self and said she was doing a favor for a friend.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyway the moral of this story is That one delivery person tolls up dressed as post man and the rest have you under survelence
    <br/>
    so keep house clean and mouth shut if ever in a have a CD and if not normal mail person especailly if in a small town and you get a odd feeling that somethings wrong dont accept it or if you do write return to sender on it and set it by the door?
    <br/>
    depends on situation
    <br/>
    good luck fellow SR users

    This is absolutley INCORRECT, Sir. Express/Priority/First Class...all protected and require warrent to open. PERIOD.  The only classes of mail NOT protectd by the 4th Amendement are those that do not(or aren't supposed to) contain personal communication such as Media Mail, Standard(junk) Mail, Pkg Services.

    4. Can Postal Inspectors open mail if they feel it may contain something illegal?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First-Class letters and parcels are protected against search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and, as such, cannot be opened without a search warrant. If there is probable cause to believe the contents of a First-Class letter or parcel violate federal law, Postal Inspectors can obtain a search warrant to open the mailpiece. Other classes of mail do not contain private correspondence, and therefore may be opened without a warrant.

    Well personally we have shipped close to 30= express packages and all have made it. In our opinion express leaves less time for them to dick with it, infact theres a thread by a postal worker on here somewhere and thats what she said also, the less time it's sitting around the better although certain sates xray overnight and express packages if near a large marijuana production area, for instance humboldt. Keep that in mind when ordering in the mail. We receive all our stock through the mail but my guy never never sends express or overnight since he's in Cali, regular post for us and we're talking 3-6 pounds! Hope I helped a little! And Never Never Never Sign for Anything!!

    +1 It's nice to see someone come in and calm everyone down....there's seriously so many paranoid people on these forums. I use Express ALL OF THE TIME and have never had a problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just use your head and use a vendor who knows what the fuck they're doing and you're fine....or just don't order Express and leave it to those of us who love Express and getting our orders overnight for cheap  :).

    Thoughts on various opinions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They absolutely have an officer dress up as either a fedex or ups. This is from real experience. A friend said it was real strange since they were expecting usps. It's not feds it's detectives. if you have fed agents coming to your door, it better be for more than a fucking pound. And Express is definitely more scrutinized. Especially from certain states. There's also the many various reasons/flags for something to become noticed. Every time you hear of a story or a bust... try and think about what they did wrong to cause it.

    I actually had Express ordered some heroin in liquid form that got destroyed en route by USPS. It looked like they ran over the package with a car (makes you wonder what goes in in those facilities) and it had leaked all over the outer and inner envelopes by the time I got it. The outer envelope that was visible to all the USPS staff only had a few brown stains, but still, a paranoid person would think that this would be picked up by drug dogs or postal inspectors right away. Nope, my package still made it to me without incident (besides being crushed and destroyed, of course). I was pretty pissed at USPS but the vendor made up for it (it wasn't his fault either, just the incompetency of USPS! I've read AMA's on reddit and such about how packages get ridiculously mishandled by shipping employees. I've also ordered the same thing Express from that same vendor over 10 times without incident). I've been trying to order priority more often just to save money and priority usually only takes one day longer than express anyway, so why not just order priority unless you really need it fast?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd say the only way Express would be more suspicious is if there was some stinky weed in there, since more people recognize the smell of weed. Sad how one of the least dangerous drugs is the most noticeable and detectable in drug tests too. The USPS is the least of your worries when dealing with SR. People order packages off the internet all the time. Whenever I go to my moms house, there are packages everywhere because she does all her shopping online. Its the norm these days, and your package wont get a second glance.

    we give few peices of info here:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1 - thing with express is AIRPLANES. this auto makes things 'more scrutinized'. also control of package much tighter.
    <br/>
    - priority use airplane also sometimes, but included with many other things too and less priority makes bigger shipments less control, u understand..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2 - OP story could be true, cops do stupid things many times.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    3 - send things via early express, 8am service, etc. etc. allow very little time to bother with package - TRUE. LE has procedure and rules they must follow and if pack get from (example) CA to FL in 14 hrs, outside of actual travel time to make this leave very little time to intercept/log/try CD, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you order 100lbs via 8am early AM delivery and pack show up at 11am... haha.. DO NOT TAKE IT! understand?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    like everything there 2 side to every sword I think you Americans say. priority blend in with more pack and take less 'scrutinized' routes not have so many controlled tracking methods, but express leave less time to set up CD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    pick your chance ;)  we think priority/regular better choice.
