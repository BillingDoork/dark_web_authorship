    I'm currently in the middle of getting everything I need for my xmas bender.
    <br/>
    Now I have almost every thing but my weed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to get an OZ from the dam, But i'm afraid of it not getting here on time and it sitting on the sorting office over christmas.
    <br/>
    If that happens how long until the smell permeates out of the double vacuum seal? Is there a high chance of it getting caught or will it be fine?

    There's a thread on the forums somewhere by some guys in Scandinavia who got their hands on a drug sniffer dog and they ran all sorts of tests with different drugs and types of packaging, single to multiple vac sealing etc, do a search and have a read, it was quite informative  :)

    Who knows mate but the longer something sits in its packaging the more likely the chances of permeation and possible detection, your looking for absolutes and there are none, if you trust the vendors techniques just hurry up and order and take advantage of the Christmas rush.

    That depends enormously on the sort and quality of packaging. A general answer isn't possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Organic molecules are slightly soluble in most polymers, so after some hours even a perfect airtight packaging will release smell to the environment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Metals are completely impermeable except for Hydrogen and Helium, the flavor molecules diffuse through microfractures instead. A perfect metallic container would probably detain them forever, however such a thing cannot be built. In practice they are probably even worse because its difficult to make an airtight metallic package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Active carbon between two airtight layers will also increase permeation time.

    Because not all mail is scanned with canine detection and dogs are not infallible, there are many factors that can interfere with how effective a dog is at any given time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Often when mail has been transported and the cargo has been exposed to high heat hot poorly packaged weed will stink to high heaven, enough to alert the postal worker/customs and trigger a more thorough search.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    @ TheYowie... clearly a lot gets through unmolested, not sure what sort of reassurances you want, if it sketches you out that much maybe order domestic and avoid customs altogether for peace of mind.
